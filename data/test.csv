"like i said at the top, four stars just aren't enough. it's one of the best films i've ever seen in my almost 17 years of life. for the people that don't really like it or understand it, you must not have a real appreciation for art or you might have a short attention span.  even if i haven't seen all his films yet, i'd have to say that this is spielberg at his peak. it's pretty sad to see that movies as great as ""the color purple"" don't come along too often 'cause i think all of us are in desperate need of first-class motion picture entertainment in these hard times.  movies like this are more than just movies; they're pieces of art that need to be appreciated more.  the idea that it was nominated for 11 oscars (even best picture of the year) and didn't get one trophy is a sign of how blind and stupid hollywood can be sometimes. spielberg wasn't even nominated for best director! it should have swept the oscars that year.  the film clearly shows you how unfair life is for some people.  if only movies were still this good....",1
"the only thing that prevented this flick from being a total disaster were a couple of interesting stylish touches.   (moderate spoiler alert) death by comic is a bit derivative of a scene in twilight zone: the movie, which delivers death by cartoon. still this was handled nicely, especially watching the ink bleed and the color being sapped out.  additionally, there is one other good scene with a demon motorcycle.  having said that, i was glad i got the dvd cheap at a store going out of business sale, because this was pretty awful. i bought ""soul survivors"" at the same time and both movies were similarly annoying with the constant realizations that you have been watching a dream. however , where ""soul survivors"" has nothing to redeem it, or have it make any sense, this at least had a couple of stylish notes, referred to above.  interestingly, the dvd lets you go to the 8 'nightmares' where something actually happens, which is the only way to watch this. the scripting between the creative gore moments is rather unbearable.  3 out of 10.",0
"sundown - featuring the weakest, dorkiest vampires ever seen, accompanied by one of the most unfitting, pretentious scores ever written - and with shane the vampire, who's every move and spoken word was so ridiculous that i burst out laughing half the times and rolled my eyes the rest.  the vampires don't seem to have any special powers at all - except for strength (sometimes), being able to switch off a lamp with their mind (one time) and... that's it, really. ever imagine count dracula worriedly recoiling from a fight 'cause he ran out of bullets? neither did i. practically any other movie-dracula would eat this one for breakfast, skin his followers and use their bones as toothpicks.  the main plot of the movie is that a human family of four gets caught up in a vampire gang fight - dracula's vs. some old geezer's. it could have been some good old b-flick fun, but the overly dramatic music was clearly written by someone who took this movie a bit too seriously, and ends up ruining the remaining part of the movie not already ruined by clay bats, mediocre acting and the laughable screenplay.  in the end it's just too silly to be funny. sure, it has some amusing moments, but they're few, and far apart.",0
"i've read all the comments on this film. i am a great admirer  of the dalai lama. as such, i read the book upon which this  film was based. the movie is an ugly and demeaning fictionalization of the truth. i do not criticize it for  altering small details or events for dramatic purposes; it is  not a documentary. but the script changes the impact, reaction,  realities, and changes in every main character. it vastly alters  the real relationship between harrar and the young dalai lama.   from the ridiculous rivalry for a tibetan woman (which demeans  the culture of tibet) to harra's music box gift, to harrar's  change of heart, everything about this movie is false - except  for the amazing photography. i understand that the shots of the  potala (the palace) were smuggled out of tibet. however,  changing a real story about the relationship between two people,  one of them very important to this world, in order to build up a  movie star is sad",0
"yes there are worse movies out there. most of them made for fun, on a shoe string budget, or as a t.v. movie of the week, but even if this was the 'movie of the week' it would rate no more than two stars. it is a poor movie about a serious subject featuring an abused woman who flees the king of the slime people in to the protective arms of the king of the wussy people. ( if this is an attempt to show that she doesn't need a man to protect her than wuss man is superfluouse to the film and ought not to be in it at all). it has no suspense, no character development, and an heroine that could be outsmarted by a rotton onion. ( i think she flushes her wedding ring on a boat with a self contained tank rather than just dropping it overboard in the ocean (where her body should be anyway) and after the husband finds her, demonstrating that she is a moron, she still makes childish assumptions that lead to almost getting her killed.) i am always amazed when i see the sort of generally high rating a movie like this gets and it makes me realize that dr. seuss still has a huge untapped market of people who would be challenged by his work. after i get done laughting at humanity i weep.",0
what a disappointment! i hated the mummy but this one was even worse! it was very tiring and unbelievable and at a certain point i found myself sighing and yawning all the time. i can't believe that people actually liked this movie. the role of nicholas cage wasn't very convincing. the whole movie felt like a grand tour around america's most wanted buildings. the never stopping flow of hints and combinations wasn't very convincing either. i stopped paying attention around 30 minutes. what was supposed to be a happy night out became a total disappointment. what a drag... i guess i've just seen too many movies to enjoy national treasure.,0
"spoilers? maybe a few details, but nothing too plot related. not like it would matter with this movie.   air rage blatantly rips off the mid-air infiltration premise of executive decision. ice-t leads a team of four ""elite"" commandos who wear baggy black shirts that we can only imagine must conceal invisible body armor as their idiotic tactics (similar to what 3rd graders use when playing star wars on the playground) lead them to absorb a hail of gunfire.   what entertained me the most about this flick was the use of look-alike has-been actors. you'll immediately recognize cyril o'reily as someone who once acted in a movie that you really liked, though it was so long ago that you probably won't be able to place it (it was porky's). here cyril plays a decent knock-off of a bill paxton character. most hilarious is porker gil gerard, who's so fat that you will never recognize him as tv's buck rogers. instead of evoking his mildly heroic character past, gerard gives us a passable performance of the crusty fat tough guy persona, which was clearly imagineered for john goodman. finally, alex cord gives us a nice hybrid look-alike performance as a chuck connors/kirk douglas type. in the 10 years since new jack city, ice-t's acting has deteriorated remarkably. it's not acting so much as regurgitation of lines that he might have actually memorized.   one of the items that plays into this movie is a cd-rom of classified information. it's being hand carried, and it's apparently and unbelievably not encrypted, despite the security-savvy aura of gerard's nsa character. what a joke. i'm severely doubting that the information purported to be on the cd would ever even all be assembled into a portable format.   despite being in a closed aircraft without silencers, the gunfire is about as loud as canned air, and causes nary a person to flinch, so apparently no foley budget. the assortment of weapons chosen is pretty funny. the flight attendant's use of a coffee pot is about the most realistic depiction of violence in the film. when she takes intuitively to the mini-uzi pistol, which has got to be one of the worst pistol designs ever, that's just too stupid. a true elite team would carry mp-5s for this type thing or maybe socomm .45s, or even customized hi- powers if they were really old school, or maybe something fn 5.7 if new school... the lame-o standard issue 92fs are totally unbelievable, having lost most of their cool after lethal weapon i. the bad guys, supposedly experienced soldier of fortune types, have an assorted mixture of absurdity, like the aforementioned mini-uzi pistol and a tec-9 with the infamous non-functional barrel extender that isn't a silencer.   there was one touch of realism on which i would like to correct the other reviewers: the flight attendant and ice-t did lower the craft to 10,000 feet for ""breathable air"" before they opened the door. and i also got the impression that the flight attendant was not able to get the door closed, that she basically just gave up on that point. as far as the landing, there was no mention of flaps until about 2 seconds before touchdown. sigh.   only the dukes of hazard eluding roscoe p. coltrane at the ""pass"" could shame this movie for use of stock footage. they obviously chose the incredible (and retired) sr-71 because they couldn't get stock of an f-117. aside from the fact that they were mothballed already in 2001, let's also forget for a moment that the sr-71 is not a pure stealth aircraft in the sense of the b-2, and that at point blank range... well, i'm no expert, but i'm having doubts as to whether it would be invisible on radar.   as others have pointed out, the repeated references to ""f-15s"" when they were showing f -16s was laughable. details of the 747 were pretty stupid. no airline would put that few passengers on a 747 to begin with, not to mention everything else that was idiotic about it. pay attention to the use of exposed electrical wiring.   wow. what a show. catch it on stars or something. don't pay to rent it, but do watch it for laughs. in contention for worst movie ever, right up there with no holds barred, which at least had some originality.",0
"it took a long time until i could find the title in a special videothek in berlin, and i was lucky to find an english version with hollandish undertitles. i think it´s one of the best horrormovies ever. it seems strange for me that some people call this movie a black comedy. i must admit, i wasn´t able to laugh about, when i saw it the first time (and it was the same with the second time!) on the one hand trelkovski seems so nice and even cute in his shy behaviour, but on the other hand he beats this boy on the playground and there is no explanation for that. but the most weired thing is of course his transformation in simone choule and the fact, that he doesn´t know, who he really is. his halluzinations are the most terrifying in this movie. of course it´s all in his mind, but is it this flat that brings out this female side of him or was it also before he moved in - i think that´s an interesting question. his shizophrenic behaviour is hard to understand and it´s horrible to see his two sides or identities fighting against each other. the result of it is that he cuts his hand first and later jumps out of his/her window. but this terrible cry - does that mean, that all will repeat again and again and again... that his soul is in a cage or something? and these egyptian hieroglyphs and other egyptian stuff ? the fact, that he/she looks like a mummy in the hospital - that´s not an incident, but a clue in my point of view.",1
"this movie is phoniness incarnate, a straight 11 / 10 on the phoniness scale. the fakeness of the accents as well as the tightness of the cardigan spandex pants are just staggering. yanks, although the real scotland may be just as colourful, if you ever go there don't expect to be given much of a the chance to ""dance out"" controversies with the locals. also, don't attempt to sway local opinion through the otherwise fine art of tapdancing.  there are a couple of infectious singing-and-dancing scenes, but the plot is far too cheesy and linear, and the dialogue is often too weak. i also doubt whether anyone would want to be stuck in a timewarped 18.th-century scottish village in the boondocks rather than gay new york city. maybe it wasn't such a big sacrifice for that priest to have left brigadoon, maybe he was just trying to get the hell out of that dump.  watch it for the fine alternative-reality view of what a christopher streed day-parade in scotland would look like on lsd. other than that i'd only recommend it to hollywood muscial completists.",0
"disappearance is set in the mojave desert as jim (harry hamlin) & patty henley (susan dey) plus their two kids katie (basia a'hern) & matt (jeremey lelliott) along with ethan (jamie croft) a friend of the family are travelling along, they stop at a roadside diner & ask about an old deserted mining town on the map called weaver. no-one claims to have heard of it but it's definitely there & the family decide to take a detour in order to check it out & take some pictures. once at the town they take some pictures & have a look around but when it comes time to leave their car won't start & they have to spend the night there. while looking around they find a camcorder videotape which they play only to discover footage of a scared woman saying all her friends have disappeared, the next morning & their car has disappeared as things take a very sinister turn. what is weaver's secret? will the henley's ever leave there alive...  written, co-executive produced & directed by walter klenhard i have to say that disappearance is one of the most frustrating films i have ever watched. for the first 85 minutes it was a pretty good mysterious mix of thriller & horror film but then we are treated to one of the single worst endings ever in motion picture history. the script suggest lots of different things but never elaborates or confirms & i was sitting there genuinely intrigued about what was going on, from the families car mysterious disappearing, the four recent graves, the thing in the abandoned mines, the supernatural sandstorm, the sudden & unexplained disappearance of ethan & his just as unexplained reappearance, the sheriff's sinister motives, the compass in the car going crazy, the crashed plane, the townspeople denying weaver existed & the possible side effects of a neutron bomb being dropped near weaver in the 40's but they are all tossed out of the window & for all we know could have been totally separate random events. everything was coming along nicely & was set up for a big twist revelation but none was forthcoming & instead i was treated to the most ambiguous, strange, surreal & downright frustrating ending possible. if nothing else the ending contradicts much of what has gone before & leaves the viewer with more questions than answers. it's almost as if the makers had these great ideas but then didn't know what to do with them & just made the ending up on the spot. i just felt i put so much effort into watching the film which can be pretty slow at times without any sort of reward & in fact the ending felt more like a kick in the teeth or a good two finger salute!  director klenhard does a reasonable job here, the old ghost town has a certain atmosphere & the large expansive desert locations give a good sense of isolation. it's well made but what were they thinking with that ending? nothing fits, nothing makes sense & it's just a huge frustrating mess that after sitting through the thing for nearly an hour & a half leaves you confused & wanting to know more. despite being a horror film there's no blood or gore although there are one or two creepy moments here & there. the film actually reminds of the hills have eyes (2006) remake for large parts as that is what the film is set-up to be before a bizarre ending which does nothing to bring any closure to the film.  technically the film is good with high production values, good special effects, sets, locations & cinematography. set in america but filmed in south australia. the acting is fine from a decent cast.  disappearance is a really odd film, for a long time it shapes up to be a neat little horror mystery thriller but it never explains anything which happens & the truly surreal ending just throws up more questions than answers. i really can't see anyone making head nor tail of this, i really can't.",0
"whatever happened to keaton is what i want to know.  actually i don't, i crawled away, heaving, thinking she must owe half the bookies in vegas, or maybe not, maybe she was just brainwashed, blackmailed and bored to death. rich enough to adopt a third-world country, she somehow had to star in yet another cookie-cut, cliché-ridden drool'athon, based on the same character-franchise she's been rehashing since 'father of the bride'('91). you'd think she's going head to head with mr.bean.  (spoilers)   so hubby (dax) get's fired by obnoxious son of boss, his mom (keaton)leaves his dad after classic row, and crashes over with her own dog-show in tow, oh those little rascals. hubby's got cold-feet for diaper-duty, wifey's clock a-ticking and hey, let's toss in a space-cadet as second house-guest for good measure, all in one day because that's so funny and original. wife gets fed up and walks away, mom leaves dad for space-cadet and the couple makes up in time for closing credits, 86 very long minutes later.  now if you have to have a space-cadet, he can't be devious as well, he can't scheme some excuse for his stayover, and if mom leaves dad, she can't hop into a cab dressed as a pumpkin just because some scriptwriter agonized over how to cheer thing up.   plus that gag whereby they invite her in only to then discover she's got her canine entourage in the cab has got to be outlawed by now. and you only get one obnoxious 2-dimensional boss to denigrate. another movie-killer would be the movie-script the space cadet is toiling away at, supposedly more lame than the actual one, again, dejas-ad-nausea.  liv tyler doesn't seem happy here, her voice was weird at times, it had me wondering if they later had her redub some of it, and she's a smart one, she's handled great roles and we'll forgive her for jersey girl, it was disaster-prone, could happen to anyone. dax shepard was watchable and that's being generous considering the material.  personally, it's the director, the screenwriters and especially the producers that i would love to see tar'n'feathered before shipped to guantanamo as playthings for the prisoners, and that's me keeping this 'lite'.",0
"i have to say that this is one of the best movies i have ever seen! i was bored and looked through the t.v. and found ""home room"" and it was already in about 5 min., but i got hooked. it was so interesting and moving. it shows what can happen in anyone's life. i give it a 10, more if possible. the director/ writer and actors did an amazing job. i think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it. it was great, drama, mystery, and more. i cried for hours! i think that the director/ writer should write more movies like this one. i loved it! i didn't even know about this movie, which is sad because it was so good. i wish it could go in the movies for more people to see.",1

"made in 1931, this foreign film should be seen and enjoyed more often.  we open on a quiet little french village, scanning the roofs of the sleeping citizens. then we hear something that sounds like a party. upon investigating the uproar, two neighboring men are told the story of two men, supposedly friends, who picked two numbers for the lottery.  our star of the picture has his number and his friend his. when he asks his friend, would he share half of the dough, should his ticket be the winning number, his friend promptly says no. in fact, h.e. double hockey sticks no! is the way he acts about it.  so when our man discovers he has the winning ticket and that it has been lost, through no fault of his own, he is frantic. everyone is out for themselves, looking for this ticket, in something like a precursor to ""the great race."" even though this is all a flashback, i was in knots the whole time and got so upset over every little thing in this all-for-me show-me-the-money cash-in-the-bank film. watch le million today!",1
"i'm far from a sylvester stallone fan and i guess the only time i really appreciated his appearance was in the french movie taxi 3, which is an almost inexistent small role. and yet i must admit that this movie was actually not that bad, even though i feared the worst.  when gabe (stallone) fails to rescue the girlfriend of one of his friends and she plunges to her death from a 4000 feet high mountain top, he can't possibly force himself to keep working as a mountain ranger. for almost a year he doesn't set a food in the reserve, but than he returns. soon after he's back, they get an emergency call from a group of hikers who got trapped in a snow storm. at least, that's what the rangers believe. in reality it is a group of robbers who crashed with their airplane in the mountains after their daring plan to steal cases full of money from a flying government plane failed. the cases are spread all over the reserve and they need the help of professional climbers to retrieve them...  this is of course not one of the most intelligent movies ever, but in its genre it's an enjoyable one. i especially enjoyed john lithgow as the evil master mind and leader of the gang of robbers. i know him best from the tv-series ""3rd rock from the sun"", but i enjoyed his performance in this movie as well. overall the acting is ok, it had a lot of action to offer and of course also some one-liners, but it also offered a very nice decor. this movie was filmed in a magnificent natural environment. i loved the snowy mountains and valleys, the mountain rivers and the forests... perhaps that's why i give this movie a score higher than what i normally give to an action / adventure movie of this kind. i give it a 6.5/10. if you don't expect too much, this is an enjoyable movie.",1
"the idea's which are shown in this film are with a lot of care and detail and depict what a lot of people from around the world think of the american policies, not neccessarily the united states itself. it shows what most of the people around the world think about america and what the americans dont know about themselves. 11 directors showing 11 amazing minutes each of something which will give us viewers a lot to think about when they go home after watching the movie.",1
"a remake of the superb 1972 movie of the stage play, nicely casting caine as the nemesis of his character from the first movie. but doing nothing else nicely at all.  a under-parr performance from the actors, law and caine, diluted further by weak self-indulgent direction.  the warmth of the setting in the original is forsaken for a super-modern homesetting. the subtle interplay between oliver and caine which made the first movie so watchable, is replaced with a horrid, brash arrogance that instantly breeds disdain in the viewer. but this is not the clever, to-ing and froing of liking one then the other character the original fostered so well, this is an obvious ott character assassination of both character from the word go.  this version of sleuth is not really worth seeing, watch the original film and be dazzled from the opening act.",0

(i saw this movie for the first time in the year of 2000, it was filmed in 1986) there are quite a few people in that movie who are still working in hollywood.  the view was great from outer space. it does not look unreal. it is about 2 hours long, it runs so fast that you won't even notice. you know that it is not real, but you just get sucked into it until the end.  overall, it is a good family movie.

"it seems like anybody can make a movie nowadays. it's like all you need is a camera, a group of people to be your cast and crew, a script, and a little money and walla you have a movie. problem is that talent isn't always part of this equation and often times these kind of low budget films turn out to be duds. the video store shelves are filled with these so called films. these aren't even guilty pleasures, they're just a waste of celluloid that are better off forgotten. troma entertainment is known for making trash cinema, but most of their films are b movie gold. however, some of the films they've put out they had nothing to do with making and some, like 'nightmare weekend,' didn't deserve any form of release at all.   pros: the cast members do the best they can with the lousy material. some unintentional hilarity. moves at a good pace (should at 81 minutes).  cons: awful writing, which includes putrid dialogue and countless plot holes. poorly lit, especially the night scenes and the ending, which you can't make out at all. doesn't make a lick of sense. badly scored. cheap and very dated effects. total lack of character development and you won't care about anybody. this is supposed to be a horror film, but it's lacking in that area and isn't the least bit scary. nothing interesting or exciting happens. loaded with unnecessary padding.  final thoughts: i never expected this to be some forgotten gem, but i never imagined it would be this bad. i don't know if it's the worst film ever made, but it's a definite contender. troma should have let this film rot instead of giving it a release. don't make the same mistake i did and let your curiosity get the best of you.  my rating: 1/5",0
"this is the movie i've seen more times than any other (i believe i saw it on average once every year since it was released). and every time i see it, it is equally fantastic and always reveals something new to me. the cast was most probably a combination of the very best there ever was in ex yu cinematography. this movie is an absolute must for any self respecting movie lover. in the same league: maratonci trce pocasni krug, balkanski spijun and otac na sluzbenom putu. this is a poker of movies everyone should have in his private video collection.",1
"i'll give this movie two stars because it teems with beautiful photography. otherwise, it teems mainly with clichés and stereotypes: mountain people are either dumb white trash of the fanatically religious or ragged racist kind, or wise white indians. indians are magical people who move around without a sound, can disappear in the blink of an eye, talk to animals, and read minds over large distances. and so on and so forth.  throughout the movie i kept wondering what the point of the film was (other than showing me pretty pictures of mountains, log cabins, woods, an assortment of animals, free-spirited mountain-dwellers and freaky people in church).  the plot touched a whole range of issues but explored none of them in depth. this was neither a story about growing up during the depression, nor about about being an orphan, nor about a struggle for identity. it tried to be all of those things and more, which made it superficial and unsatisfactory.  although the movie was supposed to be about little tree's education, we learn almost nothing about it. he was given a brief summary of the history of his people (who were brave and stoic) and a distillery demonstration; tried his hand at chopping wood (at which he failed) and whiskey running (literally); learned how to read (and maybe to write) with the help of grandma and her dictionary - and that was it. apparently he didn't learn much during his stint in boarding school because he was locked up in the attic.  however, grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character made sure that in the end little tree became a very spiritual person whose main goal as an adult - after, and i'm paraphrasing here, ""riding with the navajos"" and ""getting caught up in a couple of wars"" - was to ""catch up"" with grandma and grandpa and graham greene's character in heaven (instead of, say, dating girls, getting married, having children or other such nonsense).  last but not least i must say that i found grandpa's trade offensive. why of all things did it have to be a whiskey still? to counteract the stereotype of the ""drunken indian""?",0
"okay, we've got extreme verhoeven violence (although not as extreme as other verhoeven flicks), we've got plenty of sex and nudity, but something is missing...oh, yes, it's missing the intelligence that paul verhoeven is known for in his sci-fi movies. i admire the way verhoeven introduces the characters and how they have a sense of humor, but unlike most verhoeven films, the movie itself doesn't have enough humor for it to fall into the comedy genre. the acting overall was above average compared to most slasher films.  what makes hollow man a good movie is not the story, not the cast or characters, but the amazing special effects work that would otherwise make a film like this impossible. the crew has truly made an invisible man, without the use of things like a floating hat suspended on piano wires and other practical effects (effects done on set). the most stunning effects scenes are not seen while kevin bacon is invisible, they are when kevin bacon is becoming invisible and visible.  the problem is that this invisible man story deserves to be more imaginitive. here, it takes place at a lab for the most part. i would have enjoyed seeing the invisible kevin bacon robbing a bank and getting away with it, or let's say steal something from people's purses, or something like that. but what is shown is decent enough to make hollow man an entertaining movie. grade: b",1
"this movie looked as if it might be good at the beginning, but never fleshed out to it's expectations. the director is talented and has some good camera angles and artistic ideas (typical of the asian directors), but doesn't know how to create or tell a good story to go along with it. the story was fragmented and seemed to go off in all sorts of different directions throughout the film, never finding a solid, explainable, interesting angle. basically, the movie never fit the explanation on the press releases. the acting was very good, however. all the actors gave good performances, and jude law was outstanding as he is always is. it is too bad he chose to do such a weak film.",0
"'shock corridor (1963)' was my first film from samuel fuller, and there i was impressed with the director's astute blending of b-movie and big-budget aesthetics, even if the story itself was pure schlock. 'pickup on south street (1953)' was released a decade earlier in fuller's career, obviously produced on a larger budget from a big-name studio, twentieth century-fox. nevertheless, the visuals are still notable in that there's a somewhat raw, naturalistic element to the photography, not unlike dassin's 'the night and the city (1950)' and kazan's 'panic in the streets (1950)' {the latter was also shot by cinematographer joe mcdonald}. in some scenes, fuller shoves the camera so close to his actors' faces that they're out of focus, bluntly registering the intimate thoughts, emotions and brief inflections that are communicated through that most revealing of facial features, the eye. though (unexpectedly) prone to melodrama, and with just a hint of anti-communist propaganda, 'pickup on south street' is a strong film noir that succeeds most outstandingly in its evocation of setting  the underground of new york city.  when just-out-of-prison pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark) snags the purse of a woman on the subway (jean peters), he pockets more than he'd originally bargained for. the woman, candy, and her cowardly ex-boyfriend joey (richard kiley) had been smuggling top-secret information to the communists, and mckoy has unexpectedly retrieved an important roll of micro-film. will he turn in the macguffin to the proper authorities, or sell it to the highest bidder? if 'pickup on south street' has a flaw, it's that the story seems designed solely to bolster an anti-communist agenda, reeking of propaganda like nothing since wwii {dwight taylor, who supplied the story, also notably wrote 'the thin man goes home (1944),' the only propagandistic movie of the series}. for no apparent reason, every identifiable character  even the smugly self-serving skip mccoy  eventually becomes a self-sacrificing patriot, the transformation predictable from the outset. in traditional film noir, the unapologetic criminal always gets his comeuppance, the rational punishment for his sins, but apparently not when they've served their country; patriotism wipes the slate clean.  richard widmark, an actor who i'm really beginning to like, plays the haughty pickpocket with composure, though always with that hint of ill-ease that suggests he's biting off more than he can chew. the opening scene on the train is the film's finest, as mccoy breathlessly and silently fishes around in his victim's hand bag, recalling bresson's 'pickpocket (1959).' thelma ritter is terrific as a tired street-woman who'll peddle information to anybody willing to pay for it (though, of course, she draws the line at commies). jean peters is well-cast as the trashy dame passing information to the other side, playing the role almost completely devoid of glamour; fuller reportedly cast the actress on the observation that she had the slightly bow-legged strut of a prostitute. nevertheless, peters must suffer a contrived love affair with widmark that really brings down the film's attempts at realism. fascinatingly, upon its release, 'pickup on south street' was promptly condemned as communist propaganda by the fbi, and the communist party condemned it for being the exact opposite. go figure.",1
"i really liked this movie i saw the original classic a few times but could hardly remember any details. i think this movie is much better than the cartoon its not so black and white as it. i specially liked how they made the grinch such a complete character and gave a cause of why he was the way he was, the villain in this movie was not the actual grinch but the major, much different than the original cartoon. jim carrey was perfect for the part all in all a great movie made for both kids and adults alike.",1
"the story of the untouchable who acted like a great soldier, saving the lives of hundreds if not thousands, is told in the 1939 film ""gunga din."" based loosely on the rudyard kipling poem, the film is brilliantly directed by george stevens and stars cary grant, douglas fairbanks jr. and victor mclagen. the title role is played by sam jaffe, well known in my era as ben casey's boss, dr. zorba, a name that became synonymous with big, out of control hair. say ""dr. zorba hair"" to anyone of my generation, and they know what you're talking about.  set in india at the time of the british occupation, three soldiers - two romantic, dashing figures in grant and fairbanks, and mclagen as a big lug - are cut-ups - in reality, three overgrown boys. gunga din is the water carrier, treated somewhat meanly - verbally, anyway - by mcchesney (mclaglen), but cutter (grant) is fond of him. when he catches din (pronounced deen) practicing being his soldier walk and salute as he apes the unit during their maneuvers, cutter gives him a few pointers.  the merry band of musketeers is going to break up when ballantine (fairbanks) announces he's about to be married to a lovely young woman (joan fontaine) and leaving the service. however, when gunga din and cutter run across thugees, a murderous cult led by a guru (eduardo cianelli), gunga din escapes to warn the unit, and ballantine insists on re-enlisting to help save cutter. it's a buddy movie after all.  ""gunga din"" starts out lightheartedly, with slapstick and wonderful, broad comedy, particularly by cary grant, who is quite funny. both he and fairbanks are so handsome, it's hard to decide which one to look at first. much of the film is made up of huge action sequences which are very exciting. in the last part, the story becomes very dramatic and culminates in a tense, thrilling battle.  grant has the showiest role, fairbanks is the lovesick romantic, and mclaglen as mcchesney, mostly due to his treatment of gunga din, is the most unlikeable character, although one detects his soft heart in his love for his elephant annie. his softness comes through toward the end of the movie, particularly in the very touching, tear-jerking final scene.  always a gentle and likable actor, sam jaffe gives a beautiful performance as gunga din, a simple, brave man with a big smile, powerful imagination and lofty dreams. without much dialogue, jaffe conveys gunga din's soul magnificently.  this is truly the ultimate adventure film, massive in scope, with good acting, rousing scenes, a wonderful musical score, and some beautiful cinematic images. another one from that remarkable year, 1939. highly recommended.",1
"this show was absolutely great, and i always look forward to watching it.all the characters were funny and awesome in their own way, each and every episode provided non-stop laughter, and it was completely entertaining and different from a lot of other shows.everybody was just absolutely insane and breathtakingly funny, that you couldn't help but love this show.there were a few dead weight episodes, but that '70s show always managed to create some kind of likable atmosphere, to where it just really didn't matter.this was one of the best shows to ever be aired, and i will watch this show anytime i can, for it never gets old, never gets unfunny, and never gets uninteresting.",1
"this may not be a memorable classic, but it is a touching romance with an important theme that stresses the importance of literacy in modern society and the devastating career and life consequences for any unfortunate individual lacking this vital skill.  the story revolves around iris, a widow who becomes acquainted with a fellow employee at her factory job, an illiterate cafeteria worker named stanley. iris discovers that stanley is unable to read, and after he loses his job, she gives him reading lessons at home in her kitchen. of course, as you might predict, the two, although initially wary of involvement, develop feelings for each other...  jane fonda competently plays iris, a woman with problems of her own, coping with a job lacking prospects, two teenage children (one pregnant), an unemployed sister and her abusive husband. however, robert deniro is of course brilliant in his endearing portrayal of the intelligent and resourceful, but illiterate, stanley, bringing a dignity to the role that commands respect. they aren't your typical charming young yuppie couple, as generally depicted in on screen romances, but an ordinary working class, middle aged pair with pretty down to earth struggles.  i won't give the ending away, but it's a lovely, heartwarming romance and a personal look into the troubling issue of adult illiteracy, albeit from the perspective of a fictional character.",1
"probably the most accurate stephen king adaption yet. not surprising, since king himself wrote the screenplay. the story follows the creed family moving into a beautiful maine house. one of the other residents is jud, a pleasant old man who knows a few things about the area. one is the highway that runs right through their frontyard. the other is a path leading to the pet sematary, where children for decades have buried the animals killed by the highway. soon enough, ellie creed's cat, church, is found dead. luckily, this happens while the family, with the exception of louis(the father), is away for thanksgiving. jud takes louis to another burial ground, beyond the pet sematary, where church is to be buried. later, louis is greeted(not so politely) by church. he's returned, appearing to have chewed his way out of the bag he had been buried in. maybe he was buried alive. maybe not. nothing more i can say without ruining the story.  of all the king adaptions i've seen this would be the most terrifying. the characters are real and the situations are normal. mary lambert does a great job directing the proceedings. suspense is kept fairly high throughout the film, due in part to the plot development. the scene where gage is killed will stick in your mind forever. then, of course, we have the conclusion. easy to determine what's going to happen, but lambert pulls off some genuinely scary, and sometimes disturbing, moments.  overall, this is a good film and an excellent adaption. if you enjoy being scared and don't mind being haunted by some occasionally disturbing images then ""pet sematary"" is just what you're looking for. non horror fans will want to avoid this.",1
"i was attracted to this movie when i looked at cast list, but after i watched it i must admit that i felt a bit disappointed. the main problem of this movie is that actors aren't capable of holding this movie on their back. why? because of bad script. although dillon, lane and jones try very hard to take this movie on another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too ordinary. so for matt dillon fans this is watchable movie, just like for admirers of beautiful diane lane. legendary tommy lee jones is always great but this is not movie for him; far below his level. so if you get hooked up by this great cast watch it but don't expect anything big or extraordinary. the only thing that you'll remember about this flick is diane lane scenes; rest of it is very forgettable.",0
what's not to like about this movie? every year you know that you're going to get one or two yule tide movies during christmas time and most of them are going to be terrible. this movie is definitely a fresh new idea that was pulled off pretty well. a very funny take on a rich young guy paying a family to simulate a real christmas for him. what is the good of having money like that if you can't do fun things with it. it was a win-win situation. a regular family gets six figures and a rich guy gets to experience christmas like he imagined. only if.  drew latham (ben affleck) was incredibly difficult to deal with and it was just a riot to see the family reluctantly comply with his absurd demands. it was a fun and funny movie.,1
"so i'm at home, flipping channels one night, and i come across this man wearing heels and makeup, standing in front of a colored background on hbo. naturally, i did a double-take and decided i'd watch for a little while. i didn't change the channel until he was finished, it was so incredibly hilarious. the next time it was on, i made sure to tape it so i could watch it over and over again, and it has remained one of my favorite things to watch. during the first couple of minutes, you can tell that the audience isn't quite sure what to think, but he quickly wins them over with his incredible humor and wit. while many stand-up comedians mesh together in my brain, eddie izzard stands out as one of the best. his style is incredibly refreshing, and it is nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stick to current events. his show stayed with me afterwards. i went to italy over the summer, and all i could think about while i was there was how ""italians are always on scooters going 'ciao...'"" 10 out of 10. see it. you won't regret it.",1
"of course i would have to give this film 10 out of 10 as my uncle was the main screenplay writer of once upon a crime. rodolfo sonego wrote screenplays for over 50 years living in italy. he was a great story teller and someone suggested that he put his stories into writing. so rodolfo sonego did. if you check out his biography, you can see the number of movies that have been made in italy. alberto sordie was the main actor that starred in his stories. my uncle visited australia and my town, in 1968 to check out locations for ""a girl in australia"" and created a great movie about a proxy bride after the second world war. you can see his humor in all his movies. i found a copy of this movie on dvd recently. great",1
half the reviews were good so i took a chance for $10. sure priscilla barnes had some sex talk but it wasn't much. the whole plot later that she may be the other actress mother & the documentary maker falling for the young woman is stretching it. its not funny its not that raunchy its not much of anything but a waste of time. boogie nights was based on real people that were in the adult industry this is based on nothing that ever happened in the industry. it could have shocked with whats popular today in adult films mocking todays gonzo videos and that big orgy that they had 5 minutes to shoot what a joke a bigger orgy has been done bigger & better decades ago in the early 1970s.,0
"i've just finished viewing the 1st disc in a 4-disc (26 episodes) collection created in conjunction with the ucla film & television archive (s'more entertainment, inc.). so far (aside from the 1st episode), the image quality is quite good. the dvd box is shown on the title page here on imdb.  ""mr. peepers"" is just as charming as when i first saw it (5-years old at the time) and wally cox is truly endearing in this role. if you're in the mood for quiet comedy that sneaks up on you, as opposed to hitting you over the head, you'll treasure this chance to experience all the wonderful characters you might remember from your childhood. although some of the gags are a bit corny, most are ingenious and well-executed...and even the corny ones are fun. this is one tv series that lives up to my early childhood memories of it.",1

"a number of brides are mysteriously murdered while at the altar, and later their bodies are stolen en route to the morgue. newspaper writer patricia hunter decides to investigate these mysterious killings. she discovers that right before each ceremony, the bride was given a rare orchid (supposedly from the groom) which contained a powerful drug that succumbed them. patricia is told that the orchid was first grown by a dr. lorenz, who lives in a secluded estate, with his wife. in reality, dr. lorenz is responsible for the crimes, by putting the brides in a suspended state, and using their gland fluid to keep his wife eternally young. patricia, along with dr. foster (who is working with dr. lorenz on the medical mystery surrounding his wife) try to force dr. lorenz's hand by setting up a phony wedding, which eventually leads patricia into the mad doctor's clutches. this movie had a very good opening reel, but basically ended up with too many establishing shots and other weak scenes. the cast is decent, walters and coffin deserved better, but that's life. russell steals the show (even out hamming lugosi- who does not give one of his more memorable performances, even considering his monograms) as countess lorenz playing the role with the qualities of many of the stereotypical characteristics of many of today's hollywood prima donnas. weak and contrived ending as well. rating, based on b movies, 4.",0
"this very low budget comedy caper movie succeeds only in being low budget. dialog is dumbfoundingly stupid, chase scenes are uniformly boring, and most of the on-screen money seems to have been saved for a series of crashes and explosions in a parking lot during the film's last five minutes (a briefly glimpsed port-a-potty early in that scene is certain to wrecked and spew crap on the film's chief villain--no prop is here without a purpose). the whole film is depressingly reminiscent of those that occasionally came out of rodger corman's studio when he'd give a first time director a few bucks and a camera--but without the discipline corman would impose.",0
"in the days before gore and sex took over, real horror films were made. castle of blood is, in my estimation, one of the finest, although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings. in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others, which was in the theaters a couple of years ago.  director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider (aka nella stretta morsa del ragno). why he did this i do not understand, although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right. perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences. i do not really know. it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color.  castle of blood is excellent italian gothic. la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe, who ""appears"" in this film. poe and lord blackwood, owner of a haunted castle, bet american writer alan foster (george riviere) that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive. foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it, for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts. it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re-enact the crimes they committed in life. lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night!   it does not take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood (portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele) long to fall in love, even though their romance is doomed, because elisabeth is one of the ghosts. i will not give the ending away, but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story.   comments. this film is greatly atmospheric, even by the excellent standards of the italians. my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody, and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this. in fairness, web of the spider was fine in its own right, even with color and greater brightness. i loved the lingering shots, something most modern day directors do not have the patience for. indeed, when alan first enters the doomed castle, we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room, the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms. by the time the first ghost appears, the audience is thoroughly primed and ready. there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts, something else not often done in standard ghost stories. there are also memorable scenes, very visual for this type of film. elisabeth's ""murder"" and the dance scene (reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962's carnival of souls) were particularly good.  sadly, few general interest viewers will ever hear of, much less see, this film. that is a shame, for this one is a cut above the rest. i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not certain if it can be purchased anywhere else. for persons interested in this genre, it is a must see.",0
"when carol (vanessa hidalgo) starts looking into her brother's death, she begins to suspect something more sinister than ""natural causes"". the closer she gets to the truth, the more of a threat she becomes to her sister-in-law, fiona (helga line), and the rest of the local satanists. they'll do whatever is necessary to put a stop her nosy ways.  if you're into sleazy, satanic-themed movies, black candles has a lot to offer. the movie is filled with plenty of nudity and ritualistic soft-core sex. one scene in particular involving a young woman and a goat must be seen to be believed. unfortunately, all the sleaze in the world can't save black candles. most of the movie is a total bore. other than the one scene i've already mentioned, the numerous sex scenes aren't shocking and certainly aren't sexy. the acting is spotty at best. even genre favorite helga line gives a disappointing performance. the plot really doesn't matter. its main function seems to be to hold the string of dull sex scenes together. i'm only familiar with one other movie directed by jose ramon larraz. compared with his daughters of darkness that masterfully mixes eroticism and horror, black candles comes off as amateurish. 3/10 is about the best i can do.",0
"although at one point i thought this was going to turn into the graduate, i have to say that the mother does an excellent job of explaining the sexual desires of an older woman.  i'm so glad this is a british film because hollywood never would have done it, and even if they had, they would have ruined it by not taking the time to develop the characters.  the story is revealed slowly and realistically. the acting is superb, the characters are believably flawed, and the dialogue is sensitive. i tried many times to predict what was going to happen, and i was always wrong, so i was very intrigued by the story.  i highly recommend this movie. and i must confess, i'll forever look at my mom in a different light!",1
"the only thing i remember about this movie are two things: first, as a twelve year old, even i thought it stunk. second, it was so bad that when mad magazine did a parody of it, they quit after the first page, and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed it.  if you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period, try animal house. it's so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art. another good selection would be caddyshack, the classic with the late rodney dangerfield and bill murray before he became annoyingly charming, with great lines like greens keeper carl spackler's ""correct me if i'm wrong sandy, but if i kill all the golfers they'll lock me up and throw away the key.""",0

"even if you're a huge sandler fan, please don't bother with this extremely disappointing comedy! i bought this movie for $7.99, assuming it has to be at least halfway decent since my man sandler is in it and because i assumed some women would get naked (judging by the r-rating and scantily-clad women on the cover). well, there are quite a few scantily-clad women, but none get naked. i'm not sure what point this was in sandler's career, but i'm guessing it was even before his snl days. i can be wrong. this is like watching one of his home movies. he might look back at a cheesy movie like this and reminisce about the good ol' times...but we (the audience) are left to dry. this is hardly a ""movie""! sandler does a lot of talking to the camera, and even admits at one point that this is ""no-budget"" movie (that's right, not a low-budget movie, a no-budget movie). so our job is pretty much to laugh at the quirky characters. there is no steady plot, it's like an extended sketch comedy show--but a crude and badly written one. that guy who played the nasty comedian was completely annoying and it was implausible in the first place that he would receive such a mass audience. and sandler finds his comic inspiration by saying the one classic henny youngman line ""take my wife, please"" and the audience is on the floor? i'm not even going to try to make any logic here. sure, sandler's current and recent movies are not known for making a lot of sense (the penguin in ""billy madison,"" the midget in ""happy gilmore's"" happy place) but the comedy works. this is a strictly amateurish work, and even if you're curious about adam's early days in film--you still won't be interested. you're better off checking out his start on snl or maybe his underrated role in ""mixed nuts."" of course, the sandman is not the only actor wasted in this thankless vehicle. billy bob thornton also makes a short appearance, billy zane (""titanic"") has a supporting role and the great burt young (from the ""rocky"" movies) has a significant role.   this awful comedy will most probably be collecting dust on the 99-cent rental section of your local video store--and rightfully so.   my score: 3 (out of 10)",0
"kubrick meets king. it sounded so promising back in the spring of 1980, i remember. then the movie came out, and the kubrick cultists have been bickering with the king cultists ever since.  the king cultists say stanley kubrick took a great horror tale and ruined it. the kubrick cultists don't give a damn about king's story. they talk about steadicams, tracking shots, camera angles.this is a film, they insist: it should be considered on its own. as it happens, both camps are correct. unfortunately.  if one views it purely as an adaptation of king's novel, ""the shining"" is indeed a failure, a wasted opportunity, a series of botched narrative gambits.   i used to blame that on kubrick's screenwriter. the writer diane johnson (author of le marriage, l'affaire, le divorce, etc.) has a reputation as an novelist of social manners. maybe she was chosen for her subtle grasp of conjugal relations or family dynamics. but the little blue-collar town of sidewinder, colorado doesn't exist on any map in her francophile universe.   kubrick the anglophile probably found her congenial, however. he, of course, is the real auteur. and considered on its own merits, his screenplay for ""the shining"" -- with its mishmash of abnormal psychology, rationalism, supernaturalism, and implied reincarnation -- just doesn't stand up to logical analysis.  i'm willing to consider kubrick's ""shining"" on its own terms. i'm even willing to take it as something other than a conventional horror-genre movie. but it doesn't succeed as a naturalistic study of isolation, alienation, and madness either. parsed either way, the film pretty much falls apart.  are the horrors of the overlook hotel real? or do they exist only in the mind -- first as prescient nightmares suffered by little danny torrance, then as the hallucinations of his father? one notes how whenever jack torrance is seen talking to a ""ghost"" he is in fact looking into a mirror. one notes how the hotel's frozen topiary-hedge maze appears to symbolize jack's stunted, convoluted psyche. very deep stuff.  but if indeed the overlook's ""ghosts"" are purely manifestations of jack torrance's growing insanity, then who exactly lets the trapped jack out of the hotel kitchen's dead-bolted walk- in closet, so that he can go on his climactic ax-wielding rampage?  and can anyone explain, with a straight face, that black-and-white photograph (helpfully labelled ""1921"") of nicholson as a tuxedoed party-goer that pops up out of left field and onto a hotel-ballroom wall during the film's closing seconds? are we to seriously conclude that jack torrance's bad craziness stems from a some sort of ""past life"" experience? (and if you swallow that, since when are reincarnated people supposed to be exact physical replicas their past selves?)  maybe kubrick didn't care about his storyline. maybe only wanted to evoke a mood of horror. whatever the case, the film tries to hedge its narrative bets -- to have it both ways, rational and supernatural. as a result, the story is a mess. this movie hasn't improved with age, and it certainly doesn't improve with repeated viewings.  i don't deny that a few moments of fear, claustrophobia, and general creepiness are scattered throughout this long, long film. but those gushing elevators o' blood, seen repeatedly in little danny's visions, are absurd and laughable. and jack torrance's infamous tag lines (""wendy, i'm home!"" and ""heeeeeere's johnny!"") merely puncture the movie's dramatic tension and dissipate its narrative energy. (i know: i sat in the theater and heard the audience laugh in comic relief: ""whew! glad we don't have to take this stuff seriously!"") finally, kubrick is completely at sea -- or else utterly cynical -- during those scenes in which wendy wanders around the empty hotel while her husband tries to puree their son. a foyer full of mummified guests, all sitting there dead in their party hats? yikes, now i really am afraid.  given jack nicholson's brilliance over the years, one can only assume that he gave just the sort of eyeball-rolling, eyebrow-wiggling, scenery-chomping performance that the director wanted. the performance of shelley duvall, as a sort of female version of don knotts in ""the ghost and mr. chicken,"" is best passed over in silence.  this movie simply doesn't succeed -- not as an adaptation, not on its own terms. it probably merits a 3 out of 10, but i'm giving it a 1 because it has been so grotesquely over-rated in this forum.",0
"one of the worst movies i've ever seen with robert de niro, the fan is a pointless cliché of an exercise in slasher flicks. it tries to spin or twist the genre with preposterous plot lines of a a crazed fan turned psychotic - the movie meanders into nothing.

"i notice that the previous reviewer (who appears to be still at school) gave this movie a very good review and i can only assume that this is because the reviewer hasn't seen the far superior 1989 bbc adaptation of this classic novel. the major problem i had with this (1999) version was the casting of anthony way as tom long. anthony way was a talented boy treble who shot to fame after appearing in the tv mini-series ""the choir"". i can only assume that he was cast for the role of tom long on the strength of his excellent acting in ""the choir"". unfortunately the small boy who appeared in ""the choir"" had grown into a tall and gangly youth by the time ""tom's midnight garden"" was filmed and as such anthony fails to convince as schoolboy tom. it is too far a stretch of the imagination to believe that tom (as played by anthony) would befriend the far younger hatty. in the 1989 bbc version tom and hatty are much closer in age and the development of their friendship is so much more believable. for a 1999 movie even the special effects fail to convince and are not any noticeable improvement on the 1989 tv effects. the casting and acting of this version are inferior to the earlier adaptation and all in all the movie was a lack lustre version of a true classic. as a final observation i would point out that the vhs of the 1989 bbc version fetches well over £20.00 second hand whereas a new dvd of this version can be bought for under £5.00, need i say more?",0
"tillman jr.'s drama about the first african american navy master diver (gooding jr.), who defies all odds and achieves his goals despite a strict embittered trainer. the screenplay is not bad, a bit extreme at times, but the direction and acting is first-rate, and this film is inspiring and achieves what its supposed to do. i liked deniro in the lead, although its not on par with his masterful works (taxi driver, godfather and all the others) it is as good as his other good performances such as in king of comedy or angel heart. deniro is always convincing and believable here, very good performance, gooding jr. is not bad, definitely one of his better performances. --- imdb rating: 6.6, my rating: 9/10",1
"hundstage is an intentionally ugly and unnerving study of life in a particularly dreary suburb of vienna. it comes from former documentary director ulrich seidl who adopts a very documentary-like approach to the material. however, the film veers away from normal types and presents us with characters that are best described as ""extremes""  some are extremely lonely; some extremely violent; some extremely weird; some extremely devious; some extremely frustrated and misunderstood; and so on. the film combines several near plot less episodes which intertwine from time to time, each following the characters over a couple of days during a sweltering viennese summer. very few viewers will come away from the film feeling entertained  the intention is to point up the many things that are wrong with people, the many ills that plague our society in general. it is a thought-provoking film and its conclusions are pretty damning on the whole.  a fussy old widower fantasises about his elderly cleaning lady and wants her to perform a striptease for him while wearing his deceased wife's clothes. a nightclub dancer contends with the perpetually jealous and violent behaviour of her boy-racer boyfriend. a couple grieving over their dead daughter can no longer communicate with each other and seek solace by having sex with other people. an abusive man mistreats his woman but she forgives him time and again. a security salesman desperately tries to find the culprit behind some vandalism on a work site but ends up picking on an innocent scapegoat. and a mentally ill woman keeps hitching rides with strangers and insulting them until they throw her out of the car! the lives of these disparate characters converge over several days during an intense summer heat wave.  the despair in the film is palpable. many scenes are characterised by long, awkward silences that are twice as effective as a whole passage of dialogue might be. then there are other scenes during which the dialogue and on-screen events leave you reeling. in particular, a scene during which the security salesman leaves the female hitch-hiker to the mercy of a vengeful guy - to be beaten, raped and humiliated (thankfully all off-screen) for some vandalism she didn't even do - arouses a sour, almost angry taste. in another scene a man has a lit candle wedged in his rear-end and is forced to sing the national anthem at gunpoint, all as part of his punishment for being nasty to his wife. while we might want to cheer that this thug is receiving his come-uppance, we are simultaneously left appalled and unnerved by the nature of his punishment. indeed, such stark contrasts could act as a summary of the whole film - every moment of light-heartedness is counter-balanced with a moment of coldness. every shred of hope is countered with a sense of despair. for every character you could like or feel sympathy for, there is another that encourages nothing but anger and hate. we might want to turn away from hundstage, to dismiss it as an exercise in misery, but it also points up some uncomfortable truths and for that it should be applauded.",1
"visually stunning and full of eastern philosophy, this amazing martial arts fantasy is brought to you by master director tsui hark, the man behind some of the best films hong kong cinema has produced. the special effects are beautiful and imaginative. the plot is a bit on the cerebral side, but is a refreshing change from films that treat their audience as if they were morons. if thinking is not your forte, however, this may not be your movie. maybe you should go see the latest from the hollywood studio's no brain club, but if you are looking for something more, he's where you will find it.",1
"the haunting is yet another bad horror remake with phony overdone special effects and a big cast of on screen favorites and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever except maybe for the cinematography.yes remakes aren't all bad but remakes directed by jion da bont definitely are.i suppose that the a-list actors (liam neeson,catherine zeta jones,owen wilson)are there to distract us from the boring plot,ridiculous special effects, and terrible attempts at scaring it's audience however this is a movie not a tabloid magazine we don't care whose in it we care about the characters and story two things this film missed.the storyline is like taking the classic novel the haunting of hill house and ripping out four chapters and then using whatever's left for the film it is so boring and a lot of it is unexplained.the characters are pretty thin and while the acting is good you don't really care about any of the characters at all.lily taylor gives a horrendous performance and sounds like she's 8 years old when delivering her lines not to mention what a horrible screamer she is.lily taylor isn't made for the horror genre at all.the ghosts are stupid and cheesy, they look like a bunch of casper the friendly ghost's and the ghost of hugh cain looks like a fat guy dressed as the grim reaper for halloween with a smoke machine.there is this creature on the roof of one of the rooms that is a giant purple mouth and it's not even funny unintentionally just plain sad.the house is pretty and well designed that is probably the only positive thing about this movie it looks nice but that doesn't save it from it's brutal everything else.i can honestly say i felt like i was wasting my time watching the haunting on tv for no price so i would've been even more pi$$ed if i had paid to see it but luckily it was on scream channel.overall the haunting is a boring remake that tries to overwhelm you with bad special effects, a poor attempt at horror.",0
"not really spoilers in my opinion, but i wanted to cover myself, nevertheless. as the executive producer, morgan freeman wants the audience to ignore the numerous absurdities of his character in 10 items or less, a movie with an intentional indie-feel, and just be absorbed in the mentor/be-all-that-you-can-be theme. he plays a alternate universe, semi-washed up version of the real morgan freeman, who is chauffeured in an old econovan by a kid all the way into carson, ca from brentwood to research his next movie role. why carson, is a mystery to so. cal residents. he could have saved the trip and gone anywhere in the san fernando valley and found the same elements. paz vega is pretty to watch, a cross between salma hayek and penelope cruz, playing a disgruntled grocery checker at a large but slow local market that apparently is the ultimate source for moragn freeman's research. his character is only known as ""him"" to allude to how actors are regarded when encountered in real life by average people-""psst, that's 'him,' etc. unfortunately, i was too distracted that him had all kinds of worldly wisdom and advice but had no reliable return back to his home in brentwood, carried no cash or debit card, or had the wisdom to keep a cell phone with him. if one has such a high opinion of their self that they believe they possess an answer to everything like him does, then i gotta see cash and a blackberry which displays intelligence and good survival instincts to preserve that big ego which him definitely has. nothing really happens in this movie. i don't believe that either of the main character's were substantially changed by their encounter with each other. it flirts with the idea of adultery, but then that thought fizzles. this to me was similar to steve martin's shopgirl, without the sexual affair. it was self-indulgent for freeman and unconvincing to the audience.",0
adorable! i saw domestic import in philly in october with my kids. we all liked it so much that we saw it a second time with my parents. i haven't heard them laugh like that in years! it was the first time that i can remember seeing a movie that my parents and my kids could enjoy. it's really cute and we can't wait for it to come out on dvd. they need to make more movies like domestic import. it is refreshing to go to a movie that three different generations can enjoy (and not be embarrassed). i have not seen a movie this cute since my big fat greek wedding. i loved mindy sterling as the mother. she was also in austin powers. howard hesseman is in this too and he is hilarious. i remember him from wkrp.,1
"i had tried to rent this on many occasions, but was always with the girlfriend, who, as a general rule, usually rejects heist flicks and ensemble comedies with the comment ""uhm... looks good, but i'm not in the mood for that movie."" thus entereth the ""almighty solo movie night""!  anyway, i found welcome to collinwood a rather enjoyable movie. while ultimately fairly forgettable, it does have moments of fun and a few laugh out loud moments. i was unfamiliar with the fact that it was a remake, and as a general rule watch movies trying to ignore that fact and watch them on their own merits anyway. george clooney puts in a humorous and brief cameo as a wheeled safe cracker that, for the most part left me wondering two things... 1. wouldn't every comedy be better if mr. clooney put in a strange 5 minute cameo? and 2. how do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easily do they wash off? the cast, all fine actors in their own right, put in a great job, and you get the impression that they had a good time working together which is fairly important in a movie like this. needless to say all does not go as planned in this movie, both plot-wise and humor-wise, but it made me check out the special features and consider watching the original, so i consider it a success! rent this one for a good time, maybe grab a few friends and a pizza. you'll have a good time.  ***7/10***  on a side note, the soundtrack is spectacular. it's great to hear the far under appreciated paolo conte used, and it left me humming snippets of the score long after the credits rolled.",1
"this is a wonderfully goofy example of a self produced, written and directed vanity project ...while i was working as a crew member john carradine commented to me (before the burning at the stake sequence): ""this is the worst piece of sh*t i've ever worked on ...and i've worked on a lot of pieces of sh*t."" also an interesting moment earlier when jim mitchum was having trouble with his lines and started cursing in the courtyard location of the santuario (a religious shrine in chimayó) - at which point one of the local ""vato loco"" low-rider onlookers growled ""...show some respect man"", which apparently caused jim to remember where he was, as he then made a very profound and heartfelt apology for his inappropriate behavior. in any case the crew did the job on deferment and were never fully paid - but came away with plenty of particularly bizarre stories - like the night we caught the producer/director's 10 year old son entertaining himself by constructing miniature burmese tiger traps for us to break our legs in. like they say: ""ya gotta' love the biz...""",0
"there are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former. this short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience. it presents a simple story, told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going, then just gets better and better. clooney's cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including sam rockwell and luiz guzman can easily make it on their own. likeable and funny, hilariously so towards the end, welcome to collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre.",1

"will and ted's bodacious journey is an existential trip through themes of mortality, religion, time, heaven and hell, man's quest for fame and his fears of the body being overcome by a soulless machine. it is the most intelligent work of fiction since paradise lost and references many great past works of art- dante, iron maiden, virgil, shakespeare. this time the dudes are a famous rock band having travelled through time collecting icons from the past- napolean, joan of ark (noah's wife), oscar wilde, and charles darwin. they took the skills they learned from each of these people, abducted a couple of princesses, and finally learned to play their guitars and write hit songs. these songs teach the world to love again and war, hunger, evil are vanquished for eternity. we fast forward into the distant future where an evil dictator who despises good music called simon cow-al wants to rule the world. he eats rooshus (the cool guy from the first film who helps bill playboy esquire and ted theodore alvin) and gains the power to send two cyborgs back in time. the cyborgs are living tissue over metal exoskeleton and coated in mimetic poly alloy allowing them the survive the turmoil of time travel, and they can imitate anything they sample by physical contact. it is their job to kill the good biff and fred and take over their lives by making terrible music that no-one could like. by doing this they will change the world forever- gryll and jed's music will never be made leaving a world of war, famine, and hatred, and more annoyingly, bland boy/girl group pop music. there is a startling twist as the good guys actually are killed and they have to work out a way to save the world, themselves, and their wives from the evil dopplebangers inhabiting their bodies.  penelope spheerhead shows her knowledge of both youth culture and real culture by mixing modern day music and phrases with post modern sets and artistic references, and seeks to teach us all something by delving into our very psyche to show us ourselves. she presents the nightmares which faced the late 80s teen in a society which had abandoned them and beckons us to dissect the post structuralist jingoism, self love, and malaise of the time. charging us with a belief that we can indeed change the world it is an inspiring message, but in order to achieve such dreams we must traverse and indeed face our nightmares. to overcome is to succeed, to defeat death is the first step in truly living and not merely surviving. in the words of kenneth reeves- 'wow!' best scene: for a fun game- see how many songs, bands, and albums cover references you can spot throughout the film. there are at least 6.",1
"this is definitely one of jet's best efforts. few actors are able to play the stoic as jet li can. the action is rapid-fire, and special-effects boosted for intensity purposes. as a result, it may take americans a little off-guard. a little suspension of disbelief goes a long way in a jet li film. i feel that it is an excellent introduction to jet's work and look forward to further masterpieces (especially fist of legend) making it into the us market. a nice mixture of gunplay and physical conflict will satisfy most action flick enthusiasts.",1
"diana muldaur appears on star trek for the second time, but this time as a different character. no one on board seems to notice--maybe it was the hair. regardless, this time she is not the receptacle for a god (see the previous episode) but is a very famous lady with magical powers that enable her to communicate and see a medusan without going crazy (the standard human response). unfortunately, the man that is most in love with her is a few cards short of a full deck and he tries to kill the medusan ambassador (who, oddly, lives in a small crate--this is a lousy way to travel). and, unfortunately, muldayr isn't wound all that well herself. what happens next is kind of dumb and by the time the episode was over the first time i saw it, i was pretty relieved. watching all the men on board go ga-ga over muldaur was pretty silly and the acting of spock when he briefly went crazy was pretty campy. do yourself a favor--if you haven't seen the show before, pick a different episode.",0
"this is just flat out unwatchable. if there's a story in here somewhere, it's so deeply buried beneath the horrid characters and jarring camera work that's it's indiscernible. there's a group of vampire hunters who go around doing their thing, and the vampires they kill have little aliens inside of them. they pop their heads out and talk like speedy gonzales. if you can imagine a blood and gore covered alien sock puppet screaming in horror as a cowboy dude zaps it with a cattle prod, well, that's what you get here. these folks are loud, obnoxious, violent, and just extremely annoying. then there are some anti-human humans, who stand around in their cgi spaceship being so incredibly pompous that it's impossible to take. these folks make hillary clinton seem like a right-wing extremist in comparison. they're friends with some vampires, or something...who cares.  then there's the camera work. remember how everybody hated the thousand-cuts-a-minute crap from the recent rolleball remake? the folks who made this movie love that stuff. there's enough of it in here for three really crappy nu-metal videos on mtv.  nuff said. this thing smells. in comparison, dracula 3000 is a masterwork.",0
"can i be as simple and primitive in my evaluations as to simply say ""i liked it""? it's reasonably funny by bits, it got great stars and it's gorgeous to look at. the songs (there are about two which are then repeated) are forgettable, but they get a healthy ironic treatment (such as the terribly handsome mr fairbanks exploding into frenzied wagnerian version of the tender ballad miss grable has just rendered); there isn't much dancing with all the 1861 crinolines draped around miss grable, and the comedy might be a bit heavy handed, but the result still is very uplifting. the photography (including real outdoor shots which are a thrill) is amazing, playing around with different shades of lush heavy gold. miss grable is a bit past her prime and on the plumpish side, but still fresh and comfortable in this continental ""olde worlde"" comedy. it's pretty much along the line of ""down to earth"" with rita hayworth, and that one tends to be rather disliked by many. so i suppose several people would deem ""that lady in ermine"" to be outdated and stuffy. but it's a fairy tale, and these tend to move along at a certain paste anyhow. my suggestion is - just enjoy the artwork, the costumes, the witty script and everything else this film has to offer, and stop complaining. the film has been released on dvd in germany, with both german and english soundtrack.",1
"so i had heard from a few people that this film had brought them to tears in the theater. as i watched it for the first time i was expecting another romantic, tear-jerking barbra streisand film; something like the way we were. i was certainly wrong. the chemistry between the two main characters, esther hoffman and her john howard, was nonexistent, making it impossible to get attached to the characters. there wasn't anything romantic about it. streisand's character fell for an alcoholic drug addict who couldn't sing a single note without making me want to hit the fast-forward button. at one point her character finds her husband in bed with another woman and she forgives him about five minutes later. there's nothing romantic about a deadbeat rock star and a woman who can't seem to realize it until he actually dies. parts of the movie seemed to drag on and on, and i kept asking myself when it was going to end.  the death of john howard was completely predictable. there was totally obvious foreshadowing of his reckless behavior early on in the movie, and when he died i felt no emotion whatsoever. it wasn't a tragic accident, it was him basically being an idiot. not to mention throughout the movie i was distracted by his hideous beard.  the only parts of this movie worth seeing are the streisand songs. the ending of the movie when she sings ""with one more look at you/watch closely now"" was my reason for giving this film a whopping 3/10. those 7 minutes were the only part of the movie i actually felt an emotion other than irritation and anger.",0
"i have been familiar with the fantastic book of 'goodnight mister tom' for absolutely ages and it was only recently when i got the chance to watch this adaption of it. i have heard lots of positive remarks about this, so i had high hopes. once this film had finished, i was horrified.  this film is not a good film at all. 'goodnight mister tom' was an extremely poor adaption and practically 4.5/10 of the book was missed out. particularly, i found that a lot of the characters and some great scenes in the book were not in this. there was not much dialogue, it was rushed and far too fast-moving, but i was mostly upset by the fact that you never got to see the bonding and love between william beech and tom in this film which was a true let down. the casting was not all that good,either. i thought this could have been really good, but it was so different to the book! anextremely poor adaption, one of the worst i've seen. this deserves a decent remake that'd better be 1000 times better than this pile of garbage.",0
avoid the usa version. it is with added us footage and the worst dubbing you've ever heard probably done by new york amateurs. the dubbing is so bad that it sounds like mystery science theater 3000. i think a black guy from the bronx does chiba's voice. i couldn't watch the entire film it was that bad. instead of this americanized version watch chiba's other greats like the streetfighter or karate warriors.,0
"although properly warned i actually sat down to watch this movie. in part because i usually give every movie an even break, and because i thought that a single movie couldn't be that bad. i stand corrected. not even george kennedy, barry bostwick or ben stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. only once during this humor forsaken travesty of a spoof did i laugh. namely during the simon says scene. the other jokes are either poorly carried out or simply plain unfunny. and some of them you actually see coming a mile away. this movie just hasn't got what it takes to be a good parody like airplane! (i+ii), naked gun (i+ii+iii), or scary movie. they all had a. funny gags, b. good dialog and most important of all c. unforgettable quotes. men in white has got d. none of the above. to call this movie bad would be a gross understatement. avoid this movie anyway you can! consider yourselves warned!",0

"there's enough star power in the house of spirits to create another galaxy, yet the final product is pretty debatable. the film and its messages are very noble, and i think perhaps most would agree with them. (liberal democracy good, violent fascist regime bad; open-mindedness good, racism bad, etc). unfortunately, we're battered from head to toe with these, and as much subtlety is used as i've described them.   ultimately, we are left watching very noble people without any flaws squaring off with nasty cretins who have no redeeming qualities. it radiates with all the suspense of a badly orchestrated ""pro"" wrestling match.  jeremy irons plays the patron, a man of many contradictions. meryl streep as his gifted bride and glenn close, as her sister in law. when the camera stays with these folks, the movie tends to move, and is quite enjoyable. unfortunately, the house of spirits engages with simply way too many subplots, and characters pop up and out of the picture like shooting gallery targets. we don't get to know them, hence we don't get to care for them. the result is boredom.   if bille august, the director and screenwriter (from isabel allende's book) had either lengthened the film or snipped a few characters, this film might have worked completely. as it stands, it was a nice try, with nice messages, and a bonecrushing yawnfest.  not recommended.",0
"romantic comedies can really go either way, you know? you'll see one that's really sappy, and you'll think you want something more realistic. then, you'll see one that's realistic, but it might be too dull to keep you interested. or maybe you'll see one that does everything right, but just fails to make you smile. romantic comedies are tough movies. you go into them with a lot of expectations, and usually, whether you like it is simply a matter of whether the filmmakes was anticipating your expectations or those of the guy or girl next to you.  of course, if you've got a girl next to you, and you're a guy like me, it probably doesn't matter all that much whether the movie's any good, you've got other things on your mind. for you, i say, ""go get her, tiger!"" for the rest of us, i say, ""see _a guy thing_."" it's a lot of fun.  because _a guy thing_ knows you're going in to this movie with expectations, so it doesn't pretend that its ""guy about to get married meets the woman of his dreams, and it's not his wife!"" plot is going to make everyone happy. sure, maybe you like it, but maybe it doesn't ring true, or you think it's cruel. _a guy thing_ covers that. what _a guy thing_ does is fill the screen with the best supporting cast i've seen in a long time, so if you don't the main plotline, you've still got something to make you smile.  whether we're talking about the seasoned veterans of big and small screen, like larry miller (pretty woman, best in show), james brolin (traffic), julie hagerty (airplane!), david koechner (saturday night live and conan o'brien regular, dirty work, austin powers ii) or thomas lennon (the state and viva variety), or new faces like shawn hatosy (the faculty), or colin foo (saving silverman), we're talking about a bunch of very talented and skilled actors who know exactly how to take advantage of the film's inspired characterisation, steal the show, time after time, and still frame the piece with an energy and a joy rarely seen in romantic comedies these days.  and that's not to detract from the actual romantic throughline and the stars that carry it along, because it's very sweet and terribly well done. jason lee (mallrats, chasing amy, dogma, etc.) is touching as the young professional whose life may be spinning out of control, and selma blair shows an understated brilliance in portraying the aspiring socialite and sophisticated career woman every guy wants to marry except for the guy who actually is.  a lot of the success of the movie, though, falls on julia stiles, the right girl in the right place at the wrong time, and she wears it well. not since, gosh, i don't know when, have i seen an actress in a romantic comedy that has made falling in love with her so easy. of course, it's all in the closeups, the voice, and the subtle smiles, but it's magical, and it's one of the big reasons why we go to the movies in the first place.  but julie stiles's slightly offbeat sophistication would be lost were it not for the fact that the rest of the cast is so incredibly dead-on in their classic simplicity. this is a movie that paints a broken world of irreconcilable stock types, makes them fall over each other to make you laugh, and then comes through with a great deal of heart.  a guy thing is a movie you've definitely seen before, and the filmmakers clearly knew that when they set down to make it. we haven't really seen any new romantic comedies since shakespeare; the relative success of this one or that one is entirely dependent upon the execution of the classic story of boy meets girl. a guy thing does embrace that with a bit of a metacinematic edge, often taking the scenes into the absurd in order to give the audience a chance to acknowledge the powerful emotions and ancient plot devices at play.  for the record, it also even manages to poke fun at the rather traditional structural notions of sex and gender that form the center of every romantic comedy, so even the feminists out there might get a kick out of it.  and guys, i think we can all agree that we wish our friends are as cool as jason lee's friends in this movie. i'm not going to spoil it for you, but when you try to explain to your girlfriend why the pharmacist and the clothing store clerk are among the coolest dudes in cinema, i suggest you just say ""it's a guy thing,"" and leave it at that.",1
"this is a film i saw when it first came out, and which i have seen a few more times over the years. it's always enjoyable.  one thing is that the comedy does not take sides: it skewers labor and capitalists equally. only sid seems outside the classic struggle, even though he's responsible for it.   spoiler warning: do not read further if you haven't seen the film   this is a fantasy, though presented fairly plausibly. ask yourself: could someone support most of his or her weight in a single strand of fabric? it would cut through almost any support.  also, when cornered in an alley, sid uses a garbage can cover like a knight's shield. cute symbolism.  someday, i'll get this on dvd.",1
"based on one of the books by gabriel marquez and it might be brilliant literature, this cinema-adaption really sucks as it's more like fighting against sleep rather than enjoying some cinematographic delices. the story is about an old couple whose son died and living a life that is heavily dominated by poverty, and wherein the main character is a cock that hopefully one day brings some money for a forthcoming cockfight. i am in no mood to spill more words on this useless pretentious piece, just perhaps that you can see salma hayek in here, but sitting 90 minutes in front of your screen for just that? no gracias.....",0
"very few so called ""remakes"" can be as good as the originals. this one crosses that border with flying colors. just a remake, i don't think so! i saw it theatrically at the age of nine, and was completely entranced and enraptured by the film.   the film certainly invites comparisons to its 1963 counterpart. the earlier film is also a enjoyable and entertaining movie, but admittedly it tends to feel more like a nature documentary than a film. this update is more epic and cinematic. still, i thoroughly recommend both films.  this film is certainly a must-see for an animal lover. we have the wise old golden retriever, shadow; the sharp, sarcastic himalayan cat, sassy; and the young, fun-loving american bulldog, chance. the animals are brilliantly voiced by don ameche, sally field, and michael j. fox, respectively.  there is virtually nothing offensive in the film. there is a bit of scatological humor, but nothing extreme. no hard violence, save a few tense scenes involving a pounding waterfall, an angry porcupine, and a dark railroad shaft.  hilarious, scary, moving, and above all real, it surprised me to see that this film didn't win any awards, not one. nevertheless, i will have to say this is just as good as some of the best picture nominees nowadays.",1
"typical de palma movie made with lot's of style and some scene's that will bring you to the edge of your seat.  most certainly the thing that makes this movie better as the average thriller, is the style. it has some brilliantly edited scene's and some scene's that are truly nerve wrecking that will bring you to the edge of your seat. the best scene's from the movie; the museum scene and the elevator murder. there are some mild erotic scene's and the movies pace might not be fast enough for the casual viewer to fully appreciate this movie. so this movie might not be suitable for everybody.  the story itself is also quite good but it really is the style that makes the movie work! it might be for the fans only but also casual viewers should appreciate the well build up tension in the movie.  there are some nice character portrayed by a good cast. michael caine is an interesting casting choice and angie dickinson acts just as well as she is good looking (not bad for a 49-year old!).  the musical score by pino donaggio is also typically de palma like and suits the movie very well, just like his score for the other de palma movie, ""body double"".  brilliant nerve wrecking thriller. i love de palma!  10/10",1
"so the other night i decided to watch tales from the hollywood hills: natica jackson. or power, passion, murder as it is called in holland. when i bought the film i noticed that michelle pfeiffer was starring in it and i thought that had to say something about the quality. unfortunately, it didn't.  1) the plot of the film is really confusing. there are two story lines running simultaneously during the film. only they have nothing in common. throughout the entire movie i was waiting for the moment these two story lines would come together so the plot would be clear to me. but it still hasn't.  2) the title of the film says the film will be about natica jackson. well it is, sometimes. like said the film covers two different stories and the part about natica jackson is the shortest. so another title for this movie would not be a wrong choice.  to conclude my story, i really recommend that you leave this movie where it belongs, on the shelf in the store on a place nobody can see it. by doing this you won't waste 90 minutes of your life, as i did.",0
"this is the worst movie i have seen for years! it starts ridicoulus and continues in the same way. i thnik when is something going to happen in this film,,,, and the the acting is worse. the ending lifts it a bit and saves the movie from a total flop. mark wahlberg is a bad actor in a bad movie. sorry tim burton batman was good but this one sucks.",0
"if you are tired of films trying too hard to be fairy tales (the ""pretty woman"" variety love story), here is a beautiful film in which a japanese businessman is pulled free from his robotic, dispassionate life when he falls in love...with dancing. wonderfully drawn characters bring to life a story that is at once deeply funny and poignantly moving.",1
"how viewers react to this new ""adaption"" of shirley jackson's book, which was promoted as not being a remake of the original 1963 movie (true enough), will be based, i suspect, on the following: those who were big fans of either the book or original movie are not going to think much of this one...and those who have never been exposed to either, and who are big fans of hollywood's current trend towards ""special effects"" being the first and last word in how ""good"" a film is, are going to love it.  things i did not like about this adaption:  1. it was not a true adaption of the book. from the articles i had read, this movie was supposed to cover other aspects in the book that the first one never got around to. and, that seemed reasonable, no film can cover a book word for word unless it is the length of the stand! (and not even then) but, there were things in this movie that were never by any means ever mentioned or even hinted at, in the movie. reminded me of the way they decided to kill off the black man in the original movie version of the shining. i didn't like that, either. what the movie's press release should have said is...""we got the basic, very basic, idea from shirley jackson's book, we kept the same names of the house and several (though not all) of the leading character's names, but then we decided to write our own story, and, what the heck, we watched the changeling and the shining and ghost first, and decided to throw in a bit of them, too.""  2. they completely lost the theme of a parapyschologist inviting carefully picked guest who had all had brushes with the paranormal in their pasts, to investigate a house that truly seemed to have been ""born bad"". no, instead, this ""doctor"" got everyone to the house under the false pretense of studying their ""insomnia"" (he really invited them there to scare them to death and then see how they reacted to their fear...like lab rats, who he mentioned never got told they are part of an experiment...nice guy). this doctor, who did not have the same name, by the way, was as different from the dedicated professional of the original movie as night from day.  3. in direct contrast to the statement that was used to promote both movies ""some houses are just born bad"", this house was not born bad but rather became bad because of what happened there...and, this time around, nel gets to unravel the mystery (shades of the changeling). the only problem was, the so-called mystery was so incoherently told that i'm sure it remained a mystery to most of the audience...but, then there was no mystery in the first place (not in the book), because the house was bad to begin with. it's first ""victim"" died before ever setting eyes on it.  4. the way the character of luke was portrayed was absolutely ridiculous. he was supposed to be a debonair playboy who was someday to inherit the house (and was a true skeptic of it's ""history"")...and in this one he was just a winey-voiced, bumbling nerd who couldn't sleep(insomnia remember) and was a compulsive liar.  5. i was also annoyed with the way the movie jumped from almost trying to recreate original scenes word for word (the scene with nel's sister's family, and mrs. dudley's little opening speech...) to going off into flights of fancy that made me think more of these other movies than the haunting. it's like it couldn't make up its mind what it wanted to do.  6. i missed nel's narrative through the whole movie. the original was so like a gothic novel in the way that the story was mostly told in the first person, through nel's eyes, and we always were privy to her thoughts. that totally unique touch was completely lost in the new version. they also tried to make nel much more of a heroine. the original nel was not a bad person, but she was a bitter person (could she be otherwise after sacrificing 11 years of her life to a selfish old woman and a spiteful sister?) and she liked to moan, and she lost her temper... this one was almost too good to be true. this was never more apparent than in the climax of the movie where the writer's had obviously been watching ghost one too many times.  7. they changed the history of the house and it's occupents too much. there was no abigail crain (the daughter of hugh whose legend loomed large in the original versions), there was no ""companion"", and there was no nursery. there was also no ""grace"" (wife of the original doctor) and hugh crain's wives died in totally different ways. these changes, changed the story way too much. i don't know whether the producers of this movie should be glad shirley jackson no longer walks this earth or whether they should...be sorry (if ya get my drift!!! the hauntings she could envision are not something to be trifled with!!!).  in conclusion, let me just leave you with some words from the original luke (appropriate substitution of the word ""house"" for ""movie""!): ""this 'movie' should be burnt to the ground, and the ground sprinkled with salt!"" my favorite movie of all time remains so. no competition from this one.",0

"godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one, and probably the strongest kind that could be made about ralph bakshi's take on tolkien's magnum opus the lord of the rings, has actually been made by peter jackson. the recent trilogy, to me, aren't even total masterpieces, but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the post-modern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good, sweeping entertainments.   but as one who has not read the books, i end up now looking upon the two versions, live-action (albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way) and animated (albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework) in relation to just the basic story, not even complete faithfulness to the books. and with bakshi's version, it's almost not fair in a way, as what we do see is really not the complete vision, not what jackson really had (probably final cut). robbed of return of the king's big climactic rush of the story, and with the other two parts becoming rushed, i ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations, though as such those same limitations make it disappointing.  what's interesting too, after seeing the jackson films first- which i also slightly regret being that i might've reacted to this differently when i was younger and prior to five years ago- is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with. everything that is really needed to tell the fellowship of the ring story is actually pretty much intact, and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in tolkien's book is given some clarity in this section. the actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes, are more or less adequate for the parts, with a few parts standing out (john hurt as aragorn and william squire as gandalf).   the lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little face-value for those who've not even seen the other films or read the books and can't put them into context. but there is some level of interest always with the characters, and here there's a more old-fashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more. this is not a garden variety disney adaptation- warts and all, this is a bakshi film, with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of middle earth.  and what bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen, in all its abbreviated form, its hit or miss appeal. along with being not totally complete as a film, or as stories, the form of the film is an experiment, to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped. the results end up bringing what seems now to be retro, but at the time of course was something that was a rough, crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers. might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation? in some parts, yeah; it does become a little noticeable, as was also the case in bakshi's american pop, that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky, like some kind of comic-book form done in a different way. still, there's much i admired in what was done.   the orcs, for example, i found to be really amazing in they're surreal surroundings. they're maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the live-action, especially during parts where there isn't battle footage (that's really the real hit-or-miss section, as there isn't continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping), and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback. it's creepy in a good way. and the backgrounds, while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy, are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together. it's almost something for art-film buffs as much as for the ring-nuts.  so, how would i recommend this animated take on the lord of the rings? i don't know, to tell the truth. it's certainly a good notch above the other tolkien animated film i've seen, the hobbit (and i've yet to see the animated rotk), and there is some real artistry going on. there's also some stilted dialog, an all-too-rushed two towers segment with the most intriguing character gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all. and seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films.   if you're a fan of the books contemplating checking this out, i would say it's worth a chance, even if it's one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not. as for it fitting into bakshi's other films i've seen it's an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement, where as with lynch's dune it's bound to draw a dark, mordor-like line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who don't. i don't.",1
"this movie is easily the worst of the series. though new line might just be looking at sales, they all know the only reason this one made more money than the one prior was due to its 3d ending. it wasn't that the 3-d was good either, because it was 50's 3d with the red and blue lenses(anaglyph.) it was just the fact that people wanted to see what it would look like. beyond that this movie was so poorly done! bad script, bad characters, bad acting, worse directing. this movie is trying to push the camp factor almost to the point of being like a ""looney tunes"" episode.  seriously, not for horror audience, because it is corny and not scary, and not funny or amusing for comedy crowds. just a total mess with some really bad cameos that are still trying to play this whole thing as camp and having it fall way short of what they probably wanted.  i remember most of us who had been fans of this series were just praying that it would end at this point because of how bad it had gotten. this is one of the movies that helped take horror out of popularity and ride a fad of belief that audiences really wanted to laugh with some stupid comedy than see a good and scary horror film.",0
"the rookie suffers from so much. there are the random musical songs interspersed through the movie, the long pointless script and enough grating slapstick to make jerry lewis blush. noonan and leavitt just don't know when to quit. it takes a full hour before the story finally gets to the main plot and the characters are shipwrecked. then the guys start playing japanese sailors with the standard racist caricature of the day. it is a shame the funniest parts of the movie are when noonan and leavitt are playing the stupid, stereotyped japanese guys. but, it gets pretty tiring after switching back and forth between two sets of characters. then it just abruptly ends. even a naked julie newmar in a towel can't save this one.  there is really little charm in the movie and it is over a half hour too long. the story just flounders along trying to set up funny situations and failing. stick to martin & lewis. at least deano had charm and jerry had that animated face.",0

"a retired diplomat, played nicely by michael york, goes to russia to get revenge on the russian gangster that murdered the diplomat's policeman son. there the diplomat meets an exceptionally strong and decent russian cop who helps him bring the russian gangster to justice.  i remembered the old action flicks of the 1980s that always portray the russians as evil bad guys out to undermine the righteous u.s. government. it's interesting to see this time the russian guy as a hero.  not a great flick, it's really typically a ""b"" action flick. michael york lends some class to this mediocre movie. alexander nevsky, who plays the russian cop is kind of ""blah"" but surprisingly has some chemistry with michael york. face it, michael york is such a good actor that he'd have chemistry with anyone he's doing a scene with. disappointingly, the handsome adrian paul gets killed within the first 15 minutes into the movie. now, if adrian paul was in this movie longer, it would've been an above average ""b"" action flick. all i can say about adrian paul is that he is real nice to look at for the first 15 minutes of the movie. the villain, played by richard tyson, is your typical bad guy. he's very blonde and very villainous in this movie.  rent this flick if there is nothing else on tv to watch. it's okay. it doesn't suck too bad. the action scenes are decent. the acting could be better, the plot could've moved much faster, but hey, you get to see what russia looks like today!",0
"just got through watching this version of ""samhain"", and even though i still like it, it's nothing like the ""rough cut"" version i have. if you check the message board, you'll see an apology from the director for this cut down version, 79 minutes., and he says he had nothing to do with this r-rated trimmed down edit with a completely new screwed up ending. christian really doesn't need to distant himself that much, because the basic gore elements still stand up, even though highly trimmed down. this is a damn shame, because this had the potential of being one of the goriest and best gore films in years. it still has the porn stars, and the inbreds, and some of the extreme gore can at least be partially seen. i'm just glad i have that ""rough cut"", because to me, it's a jewel for any gorehounds library. christian viel definitely has the skill and vision to deliver the goods, and hopefully his next project will be better produced. the idiots had a near classic in their hands, and screwed it up for everybody. ""samhain"" may be one of the most controversial and mishandled horror movies ever, and too bad gorehounds didn't get to see what the director intended.  ********************************************* just so you know what you missed, this is my review based upon the ""work print"" of samhain.  the movie runs a little over 90 minutes and has no chapter stops. there is absolutely no music soundtrack, and some of the scenes have no audio on the dialog, because i think they are meant to be looped in later. however, most of the movie does have audio with sound affects, and when an effect or scene is missing, a message appears as a cue for insertion when the movie is completed. it's exactly as it says, a ""rough cut"", but the only uncut version of ""samhain"" you are ever likely to see. reason, because the gore is extremely graphic, much more than even an nc-17 would allow. yes there are a few porn stars, but they are just there for the killing, and to add a little sugar and spice. the story is pretty standard, american tourists on a vacation in ireland and end up staying in a home in the middle of the woods. an area that is heavy on folklore, involving the ancient druids and the celebration of samhain, or as we call it halloween. (spooky)  the movie starts off with a huge dose of gore, as a camping couple is attacked by one of the local inbred mutants. this is a great gore scene, as the guy find his girl hanging from a cliff, with her crying for help. all he sees is her head, arms, and shoulders hanging in front of him and when he pulls her up, she has been completely sliced in two. this is what i would call extreme gore, with entrails, blood, and severed limbs all over the place. we are in herschell gordon lewis territory here folks, except the effects look much more realistic. i'm going to just skip the story, because it's your standard stalk and kill plot.  the next gore scene is something to behold, as the boyfriend from the first killing is taken to a cave like location (tcm-2 stuff), and bound to a table. this geek then cuts all of his limbs off (off camera, with a cue to insert a scene), and then we see his torso on a barbecue pit, turning slowly over a fire, and the torso has a hard-on (if you can believe that). yes, very bad taste, gross, gruesome, you find the right word, and it will probably fit too.  then later jenna jameson, her beautiful body and all, is cut from neck to crotch, and all her entrails are pulled out in graphic glee, and her blood drains into a pot. yummy, a real turn on huh?  but the best gore scene happens inside the house, and i have to admit, this is one of the best gore scenes i have seen. this guy (doesn't matter who) is caught from behind from a geek, and cut open at the ass hole. the geek then puts his hands in and rips out all the guys entrails, intestines, and what the hell ever else there is, right from his asshole. this goes on forever, as the guy is screaming and more and more innards are pulled out laying all over the bathroom floor. this is so extreme, so over the top, that i found myself laughing all to hell. obviously, you will never ever see this scene on a proper dvd, imo, along with most of the other really extreme gore scenes.  so, what to think of all of this. well, first of all, even though i doubt this movie would ever be released in this totally uncut presentation, it makes this ""rough cut"" a rare jewel for gorehounds. yes, it's a little difficult at first, with no soundtrack, a few scenes to still be inserted, and credits that have missing names all over the place. but that's what makes this so unique, and i wouldn't trade it for anything right now. extreme gore, yes yes, extreme extreme gore. this makes ""haute tension"" look like a disney movie.",1

"this is one of the best ensemble comedy/musical ""b"" film's that i have seen (and since i'm in my 40's now and only seeing this now, i am not an expert but i have seen all the well known films out there). when there are a ton of actors getting their lead for minutes at a time, usually the comedy interferes with the musical bits, and very often the musical pieces interrupt the comedic flow. call me in a crazy kind of mood but when i saw this on tcm europe, i was laughing out loud with pleasure! so who delivered the laughs for me? without a doubt mischa auer delivered me some terrific gut busting laughs, he even steals the ending, it was great! speaking of which, i think why this movie works is because although l & h are a selling point (and why i got hooked to watch this one (them and hal roach), i love them in their early hal roach stuff), this keeps them at a minimum and stays squarely on adult fare (by 1930's standards, and not that far from today's standards if you read between the lines). jack haley is also great to watch, i admit that i only know him from w o oz and i loved him there, and i also laughed out loud here at his waiter bit in the show. patsy kelly is the only ""ugly"" femme in the 30's movies that actually turns me on (something tells me she was a spitfire in real life); and the musical numbers have a real professional production (busby berkley'ish) quality, that blew me away from what i am used to in this genre. i could go on and on, but rest assured i really enjoyed this movie. 8 of 10 i saw it on tcm europe and will record it to watch again with my wife on tcm usa. good stuff!",1
"alan (anthony steffen), an english multi-millionaire with a few screws loose (thanks to his first wife's infidelity and untimely death during childbirth), entices sexy, red-headed women to his castle, offering them bundles of cash to stay the weekend. once back at his ancestral pile, he gets them nekkid, proceeds to flog them with a bull-whip, and then kills them.  but when he meets blonde hottie gladys (marina malfatti) and falls for her ample charms, he decides to give up his murderous ways and get married. their wedded bliss is short-lived, however, thanks to alan's iffy mental state, which becomes increasingly fragile when his dead wife evelyn starts to appear outside his window and a spate of gruesome murders occur within the castle grounds.  so let's recap: a groovy 70s euro-horror with loads of tasty women in various states of undress; spooky gothic retreats and misty graveyards; a sadistic rich psycho with a penchant for drop-dead gorgeous babes with cracking bods; several vicious murders (including a great bit where one victim has her head bashed in with a rock and her entrails eaten by foxes). normally, a checklist like that would guarantee me a good timeso why did i find 'the night evelyn came out of her grave' so dull? well, for starters, the plot is way too convoluted: there are red herrings, crazy plot developments, and suspects galore, and it all becomes a bit too much. by the ridiculous endingin which we discover that, all along, several people have been plotting to get their greedy paws on alan's wealth, and that our red-head killing nut-job is actually supposed to be the hero of the moviemy head was hurting too much to care! secondly, emilio maraglia's direction is pretty torpid. stylish, yes; but as slow as molasses at times.  and then there's the bits that are just too damn silly, possibly even for a giallo: the death by poisonous snake bite (surely one of the most bizarre choices of weapon ever); alan's aunt agatha, an old crippled relative who is played by a pretty young woman; the hiring of a group of identical curly headed blondes as maids; the poor attempt at convincing the audience that the film is set in england (mentioning 'pounds' and hiring a crap police uniform for one of the extras is not enough); and then, of course, there is the unlikelihood of finding a bag of sulphuric acid laying next to a swimming pool...  'the night evelyn came out of her grave' isn't a total waste of time (how could it be, with so much female flesh on show?), but there are much better giallo's out there. watch this one if you're a fan of the genre and you've already seen the bestbut don't expect too much.",0
"wow i loved this movie! it is about normal life in a small village. about hypocrisy and honesty, love and surrender. great! it is about things everybody encounters in life. you have to do things with passion. but some people will not appreciate your passion and will try to stop you. there are people who find the opinion of others and 'what will the neighbors think' more important than to follow their heart. don't let anybody's opinion stop you from fulfilling your dreams and passion. i loved the fact that the actors were all really normal people, it could have been my family. no big beauties, but all people you fall in love with during the movie.",1
"hellborn starts as a young psychiatric doctor named james bishop (matt stasi) takes up his residency at st. andrews insane asylum, or 'mental illness facility' as they like to call it there. with nearly 600 patients bishop meets his boss dr. mccort (bruce payne) & is put to work, he gets ward 'a' where some seriously deranged & dangerous patients are held. if that wasn't bad enough during his first round of visits bishop finds a dead body & has threatening sounding graffiti messages sprayed over his room. bishop starts to hear stories from the patients about sinister goings-on at the asylum & soon finds out for himself the stories have more than a hint of truth about them...  known as asylum of the damned in the us this supernatural horror film was directed by philip j. jones & i sort of liked it but in the end there were too many unsatisfying elements for me to totally enjoy it. the script by matt mccombs takes itself pretty seriously & i quite liked the basic idea behind & some of it's ideas but there are a few things which work against it. for a start the film is just too slow, the story is pretty good & doesn't give itself away too early but it takes an absolute age for it to get going & i was rapidly losing interest with each passing minute. i also thought the so-called twist ending was far too predictable & the ending itself far too bland & forgettable. it's a shame because i liked the story, the character's, the setting & some of the ideas but it's simply too slow & frankly dull to keep one entertained over it's 90 minute duration. it's one of those films which i would like to recommend but in all honesty i can't.  director jones does a good job, this is actually a well lit & quite atmospheric film. i wouldn't say there's anything scary here. i'm not sure if hellborn was shot in a real insane asylum but if it wasn't they did a great job on the sets & the film looks pretty good overall. unfortunately there is a real lack of gore or action, there are two hand-print shaped wounds & a severed tongue & that's it, absolutely nothing else in terms of blood or gore which has to go down as a disappointment. depending on who you believe & which review you read the special effects are either the worst ever or very good, well as a devoted watcher of low budget horror i was very impressed with the effects especially the demon thing which looks mightily impressive & is a man in a suit type effect rather than a terrible cgi computer graphic although it's an impressive suit. it all depends on your expectations i suppose.  technically the film is good, it looks nice enough & the lack of cgi computer effects is something i welcome. the acting isn't great though, it certainly could have been better.  hellborn is a film that disappointed me, there were some good stuff about it but at the same time some terrible stuff which unfortunately outweighs the good. i sort of liked parts of it but as a whole 90 minute viewing experience i'd find it totally impossible to recommend to anyone.",0
"i have grown up pouring over the intertwined stories of the wrinkle in time chronicles. my dream was that one day a screenwriter would come across their child sitting in a large sofa reading a winkle in time, and would think, what an amazing movie this would make. sadly enough that screenwriter failed, changing characters, throwing in lame humor, and all out destroying the plot. i know that it is a hard task to change a well loved novel into a movie. but why can't you stay true to the book? why must you change the way characters think and act? for those of you who have not read the book, pick it up, find a soft couch, and let your imagination run wild.",0
"i've just lost 2 hours of my life watching this mindless plot. i could make a better movie with my cellphone camera. how do they manage to get actors to play in those movies?? porn movies have better scenarios and effects... i wish i had those 2 hours back...  the only good thing about this movie is the cast. even though, their acting skills in this one could not lift this movie to passable, the rest was just way too bad!   it's the type of movie that i'd recommend using to torture prisoners into scaring them straight.  even worse, i saw a translated version of this flick...imagine, a bad movie...with an even worst translation...yikes!",0
"pay no attention to the comments behind the curtain! the majority of people leaving positive comments about this film must be receiving royalties. this is a horrible film in every way. imagine high school kids with no money and no sense of humor making a slasher/comedy video. they would receive a d for this. college kids would receive an f or asked to leave the school. since this monstrosity was made by ""professionals"" i believe there should be jail time or at least cinema probation. i enjoy watching bad movies like ""plan 9 from outer space"" but, this thing doesn't even fall into that category. the script, acting, sound, and directing are so bad that it is virtually unwatchable. if you enjoy watching bad films that are amusing stick with ed wood, blaxploitation, or 1970's horror films. after viewing this you get the feeling you've wasted an hour and a half of your life.",0
"chris, an adopted son of a moral family, a loser whom works at the school newspaper with kate (christine lakin from of the awful sugary ""step by step"" show of the now thankfully defunct abc's tgif line-up), finds out that he's just inherited a porn empire from his biological parents. he loses sight of what true friendship and love is and blah blah some other nonsense. he also has to contend with an uncle who wants control of the family business and a shifty lawyer (arn't they are?) a slightly below average teen comedy that steals from better teen comedies (the opening alone is highly american pie-esquire), bops you on the head with the moral every chance it gets, and wastes the only star talent it has (wayne newton, lin shaye, and if i'm really stretching the star word, martin starr of ""freaks and geeks"", and justin berfield of ""malcolm in the middle""). it's not bad exactly, but it's far from good.  eye candy: a few extras get topless   my grade: c-   where i saw it: starz on demand (available until september 29th)",0
"from the beginning of the movie, it gives the feeling the director is trying to portray something, what i mean to say that instead of the story dictating the style in which the movie should be made, he has gone in the opposite way, he had a type of move that he wanted to make, and wrote a story to suite it. and he has failed in it very badly. i guess he was trying to make a stylish movie. any way i think this movie is a total waste of time and effort. in the credit of the director, he knows the media that he is working with, what i am trying to say is i have seen worst movies than this. here at least the director knows to maintain the continuity in the movie. and the actors also have given a decent performance.",0
i absolutely loved this movie. it met all expectations and went beyond that. i loved the humor and the way the movie wasn't just randomly silly. it also had a message. jim carrey makes me happy. :),1
"...but it's certainly not without merit. already writer-director preston sturges is experimenting with unusual cinematic effects in telling his stories, creating broadly drawn yet distinctive characters and situations, and writing clever and sometimes unexpectedly wise and compassionate dialogue. (no wonder the coen brothers' next movie is going to be an homage to sturges.)  the major problem is that the plot's not all the way there yet; it lacks surprise, the unexpected plot twists and sudden changes of fortune that keep viewers guessing. the coffee slogan is a lousy thing to hang the plot upon, and the ending is thoroughly predictable. frank capra does this sort of thing much better.  if you're new to preston sturges, check out ""the lady eve"" or ""sullivan's travels"" or ""the miracle of morgan's creek"" first. if you've seen these already, then go ahead and watch this one.",0
"please save your money and go see something else. this movie was such piece of crap. i didnt want to go, but i had to so i thought i'd laugh at least once, nope. not a single laugh, it was that horrible! chris kattan will never get a good comedy role after this and ""a night at the roxbury."" this movie is completely obvious, has no smart humor at all, and just repeats itself over and over again. listen to me, and stray as far away from this movie as you possibly can!",0
"i've barely just made it through one episode (""crouch end""). the dialog was stilted and down-right cringe worthy. the acting was tragic. eion bailey, despite his best attempts to be dramatic, remains mostly expressionless. his eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment. claire forlani could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie. the characters were cartoons, each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random, meandering plot. cheesy special effects can be excused given the tv miniseries budget. but attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability. i get the feeling that the ending was supposed to be witty and surprising, but it was lame and had little to do with the rest of the story. if i had to compare it's overall quality to something else, i'd put this episode of ""nightmares and dreamscapes"" on par with the nbc's hercules.",0
"one of the lamer wedding movies you'll see. smacks too too much of its time period so it was out of date before it hit the theaters. the ethnic stereotypes are like a henny youngman joke, except they just aint in the least bit funny here. molly ringwald, well what else needs to be said. give you a clue to the silliness, she destroys a $10,000 wedding dress, because ""it just won't be me"" makes it into this rag, with straps and puts on a top hat, and everyone smiles cutely at her moxy, rather than ringwalding her neck. its a helluva a cast too, check out how heavy ally sheedy is. wheeeew!",0

"may contain minor spoilers.  dressed to kill, having just seen it for the first time the other day, is a movie with some terrific sequences, some decent performances, and a nice, though obvious hitchcock ripoff, plot twist at the end. it's just too bad certain things, quite obvious, prevent it from being a classic.  dressed to kill deals with a mystery of a killer who has slain at least two women (could have been more but the movie never tells us), and the search for the killer by three people: a brainy kid whose mom was a victim, a lively hooker whose the only one who can identify the killer, and a psychiatrist whose patient was the slained brainy kid's mother. there are a host of well done performances including nancy allen as the hooker liz, angie dickenson as the sexually frustrated victim kate miller, and micheal caine as doctor rober elliot whose has more hidden than meets the eye; though by no standard is anyone really outstanding. on the other hand denis franz, later to be a great character along the same lines on the hit show nypd blue, is embarrassing as an over-exaggerated, ruthless, hateful detective, though he takes little screen time so it doesn't hurt the movie that much. keith gordon, the brain child, is decent, but is almost too smart to really be believable.  what sticks with me the most in the film are the tense sequences. the scene with the sexually frustrated mother at the museum is gripping and well done, as is the later sequence leading to her untimely death. i also love the sequence at the doctor's office, that reveals the identity of the killer, which really makes the whole film come together at once. and there's a split screen scene that i thought was almost classic. still there's another situation when liz is on a train, running from what may be the killer, that gets taken in directions it should never had with almost embarrassing racial stereotypes. as a thriller it's tense and quite often believable. as a crime drama it often falters, especially with the incomplete, ridiculous explanation of everything that happened in the end. there's also a needless, and way too long, dream sequence at the end, in which they had the audacity to shoot someone's foot for what seemed minutes at a time. this was an up and down experience; one scene would catch me by the heart and mind with enticement, and the next would make me squirm and ask why. at more than 100 minutes this could have been under 90 and been a better film.  scary movie fans should like this. it still stands as a better film than most of today's slasher flicks. maybe it was a better film in it's time, but having just seen it recently i can say i enjoy it, and it is worth watching for my three favorite scenes alone.",1
"this movie has the made for tv stink all over it. though, it started out with great intentions, featuring great looking sets and authentic props and costumes. the film quickly degenerated into horrible on the nose cheesy dialogue, and rushed tv sappy melodramatic acting. the characters were so sappy that at times i thought that they are about to degenerate into a bilious puddle of goo, and the action was so convoluted and poorly cut that it looked as it the soldiers were merely standing around and taking turns shooting at one another. the germans were so unrealistically depicted that it was painful to watch. the only thing that the german officers talked about was how wonderful the americans are. please take my word for this. i am a huge fan of the war genre, and this movie is crap. nevertheless, this dvd does have an excellent extra feature, covering letters from the wwi front lines, thus making this rental not a total waste of my time.",0
"there has been a lot of love that has been put into wes anderson's ""fantastic mr fox"", unfortunately all the love is for himself. granted, there has been a lot of time and effort been put into making this ever so self-consciously quirky universe but if only the same time and effort had been put into the script to try and make it funny. the worrying thing is that i think it was, and this is the best that wes anderson could come up with.  the animation is good in the close-up shots of the animals, however when the camera is further away everything becomes really harsh on the eyes and to be perfectly honest looks like a bit of a mess. there wasn't really anything special about the acting either, with wes opting to choose his buddies and big names over more specialised voice actors that could have probably made the film better. i'm pretty sure george clooney's voice acting resume consists of two cameo appearances in south park, one of them where he played a dog.  the film is too smug and trying way too hard to be clever and different and is typically, despite the film being set in england, all the good animals are typical americans playing baseball, whilst the bad guys are stereotypical english with the most insulting english accents. i cannot stress how much of a waste of time this film is. i didn't laugh once.",0
"at the end of ""dragon heat,"" all i could think of was why i bothered sitting through the whole thing.  the film's premise is interesting and that - as well as maggie q - is what attracted me to the film in the first place. but was i ever disappointed. writer-director daniel lee can't hold a candle to the likes of john woo, ringo lam and corey yuen.  this has to be one of the most annoyingly-directed films i have ever seen. lee is so wrapped up in his visual style - and i use that phrase incredibly loosely - that he fills the film with completely needless black-and-white stills, freeze frames, slow-motion, fast-motion and other visual nonsense. i suppose he did all that to make up for the lack of a good story or dialogue.  the action scenes are nothing special and play out like some hopped-up music video more than anything else. there is little to care about any of the characters - including two supposedly professional snipers who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn from the inside! - who are then laden with some of the cheesiest dialogue i have seen in one of these hong kong actioners.  the plot is devoid of any twists and turns - from the initial set-up, everything unfolds in predictable fashion - and lee feels the need to keep reminding us of the characters' back stories in case we didn't get it the first several times. this is awfully amateurish writing and film-making and wastes the talents of sammo hung, michael biehn and maggie q. though, to be frank, i am hard-pressed to remember biehn being in any good film that was not directed by james cameron.  if you really are in the mood for a great hong kong actioner, you are much better off sticking to some of the staples - john woo's ""the killer"" (1989) and ""hard-boiled"" (1992), ringo lam's ""city on fire"" (1987) - which quentin tarantino stole for ""reservoir dogs"" (1992) - or his ""point blank"" (1967) remake, ""full contact"" (1992). or, even check out yuen's ""so close"" (2002), a supremely entertaining, yet preposterous, popcorn flick. and there's always the terrific french police actioner, ""the nest"" (2002).  true, most, if not all, are a bit over-the-top, but they were films that remain exciting, thrilling and even suspenseful. they have characters we care about and mind-blowing action sequences.  ""dragon heat,"" on the other hand, is just terribly mediocre. the trouble is that lee has not made a bad action film, he has made a dull one.",0
"i'll be honest,i finally checked this movie not because of the stars--though they were reasonably watchable and compelling,particularly the three leads--or even the compelling story of a breach in the presidential secret service(something,i've been informed through the dvd extras of this show,has yet to ever happen.assuming that's true,that's remarkable!). i got it because it was directed and has a choice cameo by none other than detective meldrick lewis!! well,okay,clark johnson,one of my faves from ""homicide:life on the street"" and a veteran (mostly) tv director. i'd say that he does about as good as he can with a project that is watchable but pretty average,despite the possibilities.  veteran and ace secret agent pete garrison(michael douglass)has to find out both who is blackmailing him and who killed his friend,targeted and blew up an air force one chopper and is gunning for the prez.(david rasche. anyone remember ""sledgehammer""?). his affair with the first lady(kim basinger,clearly one of the hotter first ladies we've ever had,fictional or real)is certainly not helping his standing. he's got to both ferret out the real mole in the service and avoid the hound dog like hunting of his former best friend and fellow agent and chief(kiefer sutherland,almost still completely in ""24"" mode). throw in some other pivotal service agents(martin donovan and the foxy,somewhat hard to buy as the gig eva longorria) and shady foreign characters and you have a fairly standard political thriller that doesn't aim as high as it purports and reaches the desired,if underwhelming,results.  the summary line is about the best way to describe how this show plays out without giving spoilers. the dvd extras to me seemed more insightful and interesting than the movie,though the film itself was entertaining enough to keep most (myself included) interested.",1
"it's a short movie from david lynch with just 8 minutes, but it got all the ""lynchian ingredients""! it's mysterious, dark, inconclusive, eerie, and strange; and before the blond girl starts to talk it's even a bit scary! the soundtrack is exceptional to create this odd atmosphere because it's also sinister and mysterious   about the setting itself, it hasn't the ""traditional"" red curtains, but it has socking purple painted walls, which give it an equally effect of eeriness.  the plot is about a girl who's locked in a dark room and she cries for help; then comes another girl who starts talking to her in a mysterious way, saying she's there just because of her fault we don't know what did happen or what will happen next it ended unsolved and puzzling, as a good lynch movie must end!   it's a great short, despite some amateurish acting. the girls are professional actresses, but i think their acting could have been better in this short.",1
"if you are already a fan of peter o'donnell's wonderful modesty blaise books from the sixties, you will really enjoy this movie. if you have ever seen the 1966 ""modesty blaise"" film, forget it! that was camp. this is the real modesty blaise. the story and character are both true to the modesty that fans of the books know and love. it's a long way from joe losey's 1966 travesty, and it takes our modesty quite seriously. alexandra staden is quite good and believable in the part, and yes, we do get to see her kick butt. chuckle  this is likely meant to be the first movie of a series and as such it serves to introduce modesty, her childhood and her days with lob.  since peter o'donnell was the creative consultant on the movie, everything really rings true. even the story o'donnell told of how he conceived the character is just as he told it. having read all the books, i enjoyed the movie even more for that.  now that miramax has kept their option on the property by having quentin tarrentino make this film, i do hope to see more of the modesty stories asap. especially as the wonderful character of willie garvin makes modesty's character really come alive. to that end, i really hope the film does well in europe. i have no idea if miramax intends to ever distribute the dvd in the usa. i suspect it might not do that well in the usa in general distribution. i wonder how miramax decides where and how to distribute it's films.  in the story, modesty is in her early 20's, working at louche's casino in tangier. the flashback sequences are artfully done and take modesty from about 9 years old, through her teens up to her current age in the movie - about 21-22, i'd guess. i really don't think there's a ""perfect actress"" for modesty. for many of us modesty fans, she's much too powerful a presence in our imaginations already. alexandra staden is credible. she is very slim, graceful and poised. she has lots of closeups. she has a great face - one that sticks in your mind well after the movie is over. according to o' donnell's illustrator, romero, modesty has rather a fuller figure than staden, but i'm willing to overlook that. if staden continues in the role, i think she will mature into it - just as modesty grows more powerful and skilled as she gets older. staden already conveys modesty's humor and absolute assurance very well. go ahead and rent this movie, it's not like anything else you've seen and even though it was directed by scott spiegel, it is full of tarrentino touches, great camera moves, lighting and well-done action sequences.",1
"""the domino principle"" is, without question, one of the worst thrillers ever made. hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point you'll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream ""i give up!!!""  how gene hackman and director stanley kramer ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecks.  i hope they spent their money well.",0
"i thoroughly enjoyed bilal's graphic novel when it came out, and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film, and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself. the film, however, was a major letdown. the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks, and the story is poorly told. bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel, and he doesn't do a very good job at it, either.  the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship-hate relationship between nikopol and horus. they were both out of their right time and place, forced together by circumstance. most of all, they were funny and likable. not so here. nikopol has no discernible personality whatsoever, and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid. even though the film is french, horus doesn't have to be!  we have all seen films we enjoyed, but wouldn't recommend to everyone, for some reason or other. i wouldn't recommend immortel to anyone, except maybe as a warning not to overreach your talent and resources. bilal's a master storyteller, but obviously not a master of every visual medium.",0
"i read about this movie in a magazine and i was intrigued. a woman, who one day sees herself drive past in her own car. well, i thought, this could be interesting...  ...but it isn't. first, the title. the broken? the broken...what? what is broken? the...oh, wait...i get it, the title itself is ""broken""! wow, clever! unfortunately, this is virtually the only thing going for it.  the premise is not that bad, but i think kiefer suderland did much better in 'mirrors'. a cross between invasion of the body snatchers and mirrors, and a rather mediocre one at that. a more suited title would be 'the boring', since it draws out every single scene for bloody ages. or maybe 'the confusing' since it doesn't explain anything at all, not in the narrative nor in the story itself, only some vague idea about evil copies and somesuch, dotted with cheap scares and scenes used to death, but nothing tangible. it's just messed up.  on the other hand, the acting and the special effects are quite good, but then again, it's not a difficult role to act.  after watching the movie twice, i still feel unsatisfied, a little confused maybe, and not in the e. a. poe or stephen king kind of way. do yourself a favor, and don't watch this one. simply put, there are better thrillers out there.",0

"i've seen hundreds of silent movies. some will always be classics (such as nosferatu, metropolis, the general and wings) but among them, my favorite is this film (it may not be the best--but a favorite, yes). in fact, when i looked it up on imdb, i noticed i immediately laughed to myself because the movie was so gosh-darn cute and well-made. marion davies proved with this movie she really had great talent and was not just william randolph hearst's mistress.  the story involves a hick from georgia coming to hollywood with every expectation that she would be an instant star! her experiences and the interesting cameos of stars of the era make this a real treat for movie buffs and a must-see!",1

"i acquired this, one of my all-time favourite films on dvd recently and as usual, during viewing, the whole thing just blew me away.  i am a massive fan of hazel o'connor and the soundtrack to this film just has me in tears, especially the ""will you"" track. it's a pure nostalgia trip for me back to my youth. this rates second best to quadrophenia (which also starred phil daniels).  a great soundtrack and a great view of britain in the thatcherite years of the grim 80's in which i grew up. the ending is so sad, for hours after the end of the film i am like a blubbering baby.  i expect to wear out this dvd from repeated viewing, i can watch it over and over again and never be bored, simply for the soundtrack alone.  hazel, sorry to hear about your dad darling. god bless you all. xx",1

"it all starts with a suicide. or is it a car crash? i guess it all depends on whether you choose to start at the beginning or the end. director gabriele muccino gives you the ability to enter his new film seven pounds whichever way you prefer as he starts at the end and works his way back to the beginning, showing us the course of events that led us to that heartbreaking 911 call. this is one powerful movie; maybe that is because i'm a softy when it comes to dramas of this ilk, dripping with weighty moments and chock full of devastating performances, but either way, a film works best when it truly touches me, when it lingers in the back of my head hours after leaving the theatre. and this is from the team that brought us the overrated, sappy, and not all that redeeming pursuit of happiness, so i'll just say my anticipation was closely guarded for a big letdown. with all that, though, i was with seven pounds from the opening frame all the way until the credits rolled. even though you figure out what will smith's character is doing, that secret mission he is trying to complete, it is the way in which he fulfills his penance that shines bright and leaves you with a tear-filled smile at the end.  our entry point is a bit jarring, leaving us off-kilter trying to comprehend what is going on. smith's thomas has lists of names, one of people we don't know and one of people it appears he is attempting to follow and audit. working with the irs allows him access to these strangers for a glimpse into their lives in order to see whether they are worthy of a gift he has the power to give thema gift that could completely alter their circumstances. he calls an old childhood friend (barry pepper) and reminds him to do what it is he promised, to not second guess his decision because there is no changing his mind. even in a role as small as pepper's, you can't help but feel the utter grief held aloft in the background, hanging above everyone's head. it is his character, seen maybe three times, that really encompasses the primal level of emotion being dealt with. his breakdowns, whether tear-streaked and composed or head in hands convulsions, show the bond these two men have is one that stands the test of time and any circumstance to come its way.  after that phone call, begins the journey to meet new people. thomas is on some sort of mission to help alleviate the monetary troubles of mortally ill folk, trying to stay afloat despite the heavy burden of medical bills and survival. this progression takes many turns, from a ""blind, vegan, meat salesman"" that he berates to see whether he can get him to explode; to a phase two donor-necessity heart patient, unable to print her line of stationary, or even run with her great dane duke; to an abused and scared latino mother of two, too afraid to leave her boyfriend; to a dying hockey coach that instills faith in a downtrodden youth community; to a little boy in need of a bone marrow transplant. there are people who live with the pain and inevitable future with a disposition of hope and wanting to cherish each day, and there are those attempting to beat it by cutting corners and spending all their money at the expense of those who need it to go out in style. why it is up to thomas to weed through the mix and find those that deserve his ""gift"" is unknown at first, as is why this man, seen in flashbacks as an aeronautical engineer with a beautiful wife and huge beachfront home, is now living in a motel, driving a beat-up car, going door to door in order to audit for the irs. as he says, though, ""he kind of stumbled into the job"".  smith's quest as thomas is a long and painful one, tempered with moments of clarity and honest compassion. as a man with the means to help, he takes his job seriously, crossing off people undeserving and testing those he believes are worthy to the nth degree. if that means he must yell and make fun of them, he must do it. at every step, though, you see the suffering in his eyes, the pain eating away at his soul, taking each step towards his fate, one as a saint of redemption, not only for those he wants to help, but for himself as well. it is an award-worthy performance and i only wish smith would do more dramas like this instead of his blockbuster action summer tentpoles, because, while they are fun, this guy is too good for them. the man better win an oscar before he is done or it will be a travestyat least in my mind.  the rest of the cast is stellar across the board. woody harrelson as the blind salesman is pitch-perfect handicap with a joy of life. his shy smile and belief in humanity comes across throughout, whether on the phone being yelled at, sitting in a diner eating his pie, or at the piano in the park, playing for all who will listen. elpidia carrillo, as the abused mother, is fantastic, showing the hard evolution from prideful to scared to completely overwhelmed by the kindness of a stranger, allowing her family to finally be safe. and rosario dawson shines as the ""once hot"" young woman, beaten and broken by lengthy hospital stays, all but given up on living life to find love and happiness. it is the introduction of smith's thomas that opens her eyes again to be a woman, a free-spirited sexual creature that can just live without fear of wondering what day will be her last.",1
"i am anthony park, glenn park is my father. first off i want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the amber alert system is a good one. however the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible. the major problem i had with the movie involved the second half with nichole timmons and father glenn park. the events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct. my father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up nichole without any intent to harm her at all. he loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he likely believed was coming from her mother who paid little attention to her over the 3 plus years that my father took care of her and summarily raised her so her mother could frolic about. the movie depicted my father in a manner that he was going to harm her in some way shape or form. the funny thing is that nichole had spent many nights sometimes consecutively at my fathers place while sharon would be working or doing whatever she was doing. the reason that my father was originally thought to be violent was because he had items that could be conceived to be weapons on his truck. my father was a landscaper. the items they deemed to be weapons were landscaping tools that he kept in his truck all the time for work. my recommendation is take this movie with a grain of salt, it is a good story and based on true events however the details of the movie (at least the nichole timmons - glenn park portion) are largely inaccurate and depict the failure of the director to discover the truth in telling the story. the funny thing is, that if the director would have interviewed any of sharon's friends who knew the situation they would have stated exactly what i have posted here.",0
"jay chou plays an orphan raised in a kung fu school, but kicked out by the corrupt headmaster after fighting with a bunch of thugs in the employ of a nefarious villain. he happens upon down-on-his-luck trickster eric tsang, who immediately sees cash potential in the youngster's skills. basketball is the chosen avenue for riches, and tsang bids to get him a spot on a university team and to promote him in the media. general success leads to a basketball championship and a really nasty rival team managed by the same nefarious villain of before.  it's all a bit shaolin soccer i guess, but not so quirky or ridiculous - the plot sticks pretty close to sports movie conventions, and delivers all the elements the crowd expects from the set-up. you've seen it all before, but it's the kind of stuff it never hurts to see again when it's done well. luckily it really is done well here (some might say 'surprisingly' with chu yen-ping in the director's chair... i expect he had good 'assistants') - the script delivers and the presentation is slick and stylish. jay chou remains pretty much expressionless throughout, but such is his style, and when he does let an emotion flicker across it can be to quite good comic effect. eric tsang compensates with a larger-than-life character that he's played many times before (in real life, for instance) who gets many of the films most emotional moments.  since the film revolves around basketball, it's good that the scenes of basketball matches are suitably rousing. the cast show some real skill, including chou, and some well done wirework and cgi add that element of hyper-real kung fu skill that make the scenes even more entertaining (assuming you like that sort of thing) and justify the movie's plot/existence.  there's only one significant fight scene in the movie, but it's a doozy in the ""one against many"" style. jay chou appears to do a lot of his own moves, and is quite impressive - he's clearly pretty strong and fast for real, and ching siu-tung's choreography makes him look like a real martial artist. i wish there'd been more, but at least it's a lengthy fight.  very much the kind of chinese new year blockbuster i hoped it would be from the trailer, and recommended viewing!",1
"man to man tries hard to be a good movie: it has its heart at the right place, it aspires to be epic and it has a message that no doubt everybody will appreciate. but there lies also some of the problems of this picture. it strives so hard to be good and to get its message across that sometimes the viewer must feel unchallenged. so it is only adequate that the images which are used by this picture are simplistic - man to man doesn't let the viewer decide what he thinks is right but is hammering its message in his head. joseph fiennes exemplifies this in his role: he does his best to look concerned, genuinely moved and all the other emotions you can express with the single one facial expression his repertoire has to offer. add that the movie is overlong and loses its speed towards the end you would be easily led to the conclusion that man to man is not worth watching. but there are enough points to defend it: it is entertaining, has some humorous scenes and the show-stealing kristin scott thomas. of course you should not compare it to humanistic masterpieces like the elephant man (david lynch) but you'll be leaving the theatre satisfied. it tries to grab your heart (even if your brain thinks that it is too obvious) and succeeds most of the time.",0
"holy crap! what a terrible, terrible spanish thriller! i've had it for about four years and finally started it the other night. i watched an hour or so before heading to bed. i was pretty intrigued by the whole thing. i finished it last night and couldn't believe where i stopped it the night before. literally, i stopped it the second before the movie went completely downhill.  like i said, i was pretty intrigued and curious as to where this mystery was going but stopped it right when simon receives the package in the bar. i picked up when he opens up the package to reveal a laser gun and then plays a ""menacing"" game of laser tag. whew! then the big reveal is that the whole thing is a terrorist plot by role playing game nerds. whew! you can tell the spanish industry was definitely behind director mateo gil (co-writer of amenabar's two big previous hits). there is an excellent score and great photography. but this scenario reeks of silliness. how anyone sat through the last 40 minutes with a straight face is beyond me.",0
"the story and the show were good, but it was really depressing and i hate depressing movies. ri'chard is great. he really put on a top notch performance, and the girl who played his sister was really awesome and gorgeous. seriously, i thought she was carmen electra until i saw the imdb profile. i can't say anything bad about peter galleghar. he's one of my favorite actors. i love anne rice. i'm currently reading the vampire chronicles, but i'm glad i saw the movie before reading the book. this is a little too""real"" for me. i prefer lestat and louis's witty little tiffs to the struggles of slaves. eartha kitt was so creepy and after her character did what she did the movie was ruined for me; i could barely stand to watch the rest of the show. (sorry for the ambiguity, but i don't want to give anything away) sorry, but it's just not my type of show.",0
"this movie's full title is ""waqt: race against time"". that's a race no one can ever win, but you can certainly cut your losing margin by not wasting any of your precious ""waqt"" on this bakvaas. this movie was clumsy and manipulative in a way that made k3g look honest. it strained my credulity too far. it was ridiculously stupid in its storyline, and deserves to be mocked for it.  it's not quite as awful as baghban or black, but this movie has nothing to recommend it. stupid, pointless, with a ridiculously ott performance by amitji. the central ""plot"" is another nasty example of the crudely manipulative propaganda that infests so many ""family"" bw films. if my father, who raised me, and who i love dearly, treated me like big b did akshay, i'd shoot him myself. to say nothing of the trivialising of terminal illness.",0
"some might scoff, but there is actually a real art with making particularly bad films. this misses out on all fronts.  a bunch of young people -- women with heaving breasts and continuously wet t-shirts, naturally -- go to film ""blood surfing"" and end up running into a 31 foot crocodile.  not only was the croc obviously fake, but some of the props [notice the boat hitting the reef in particular] look like they've come out of thunderbirds!  no good, from start to finish. don't see it!",0
"maybe it's just because i have an intense fear of hospitals and medical stuff, but this one got under my skin (pardon the pun). this piece is brave, not afraid to go over the top and as satisfying as they come in terms of revenge movies. not only did i find myself feeling lots of hatred for the screwer and lots of sympathy towards the ""screwee"", i felt myself cringe and feel pangs of disgust at certain junctures which is really a rare and delightful thing for a somewhat jaded horror viewer like myself. some parts are very reminiscant of ""hellraiser"", but come off as tribute rather than imitation. it's a heavy handed piece that does not offer the viewer much to consider, but i enjoy being assaulted by a film once and awhile. this piece brings it and doesn't appologize. i liked this one a lot. do not watch whilst eating pudding.",1
"this movie was pretty much a waste of an hour and a half of my time. i generally like the cheap horror monster type movies, but this movie was a disappointment. the main flaw being the lack of explaining the creatures. when they entered the house and found the man he could have at lease explained them. he doesn't really say anything about them other than that they killed his parents, and unless i missed something the didn't say how he managed to escape either... not to mention the fact that it gives no clue or reason why the only survivor stays and essentially feeds the creatures after her own near death experience. it would have seemed that she would have had the opportunity to leave after the ""cross incident"".",0
"i don't know what the rest of you guys watch steven seagal movies for, but i watch them because, as silly as they are, they're at least always good for a laugh. why would you rate this movie a 1 out of 10 based on the dubbing, when that kind of thing is exactly what makes a movie like this into a cult favorite that you can laugh at the silliness of?  attack force is by no means a great movie, but i felt it was as worthy a steven seagal vehicle as many of his other movies; in fact i didn't think it was one of his worst by a long-shot. it had, most of the time, a half-way coherent plot line, and it was, most of the time, fundamentally exciting. the ending really sucked, but even that had some enjoyably trashy elements. in the end the story itself did not deliver what it promised, but i actually thought that the acting, characterization (if i may use such a big word) and the rest of the production values delivered exactly what a true steven seagal fan would expect. seagal himself in particular was exactly the stone-faced, no-nonsense man's man that we've come to expect, and the rest of the cast backed him up pretty well, without ever up-staging him. this, people, is what a steven seagal movie does. deal with it. or even better: laugh at it.  4 out of 10.",0
"first off, this really is my favorite film ever. i don't need to give anyone a description because every a**hole does that. i am literally obsessed with this practically bloodless, cheesy, lame effects having', boom-stick showing', badly edited, 80's metal horror masterpiece. the director (i heard) had hoped for a hit at the box office so that he could do sequels and have a freddy/jason type of deal for himself. damn, i wish that could've went down like that! the soundtrack's banging'. the acting's good....check this mofo out. and any die-hard fans out there, feel free to email and chat sometime. midgetorgy....i can be found at yahoo.",1
"this movie was excellent. i was not expecting it to live up to all the hype but it did. like all the bourne movies the action is fast paced, realistic and intense. if you liked the other two movies in the trilogy you will love this one also. the movie's plot is straightforward and there are no plot twists that are too unrealistic. ok, julia stiles character showing up in the italian safe house was kind of far-fetched especially after what happened in supremacy but it makes sense that she is the only character in ""treadstone"" that bourne knows, that does not want him dead and he could possibly trust and the only person to lead him in the right direction. the action is driven by characters and their reactions to what is happening all around them. the thing that i always loved about the bourne movies is that bourne can kick butt but when matched with people as good as he is the fights are struggles and he takes a lot of damage in them. they never treat the audience like idiots.  all the actors were solid in their performances. i believe that damon could play bourne in his sleep and receives excellent support from joan allen reprising her role from supremacy, david strathairn and scott glenn. i recommend this film and the trilogy. i do miss franka potente though.",1
"the original show was so much better. they should have left on a good note. this movie killed the whole idea. it was boring, over-dramatic, and the funny parts were too far in between to make up the slack. this movie really seemed like it was trying way too hard to be serious, and that was definitely not what i was wanting from this sequel. not to mention, that for a long time it was just depressing about the same thing over and over again. so, sorry, tyler perry, but try harder next time. this movie is just kinda dull, and not that funny either. sorry. 4/10 stars is it.  jay addison",0
"i did not have too much interest in watching the flock.andrew lau co-directed the masterpiece trilogy of infernal affairs but he had been fired from the flock and he had been replaced by an emergency director called niels mueller.i had the feeling that lau had made a good film but it had not satisfied the study,so they fired him and hired another director.this usually does not work well (let's remember the invasion).but the flock resulted to be better than what i expected.it's not a great film but it's an interesting and entertaining thriller.the character development is very well done and i could know the characters very well.also,the relationship between the two main characters is natural and credible.richard gere and claire danes bring competent performances.now,let's go to the negative points.one element which really bothered me (there was a moment in which it irritated me) was the excess of edition tricks to give the movie more ""attitude"" and style.that tricks feel out of place and their presence is arbitrary.plus,i think the film should have been more ambitious.in spite of that,i recommend the flock as a good thriller.it's not memorable at all,but it's entertaining.",1

"bangville police supposedly marked the debut of the keystone kops, named after the studio they worked for. in this one, however, they don't dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fast-paced car that's their trademark. anyway, mabel normand is a farm girl here who's begged her dad for a calf. she later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police. one answers and the chase is on. next, mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in. turns out it's her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there! so while mabel blocks her door with furniture, the mother and father try to fight their way in! this was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car. this was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast it's over before it's begun. the only real characterization that's developed is mabel's who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except, of course, when she's frightened. it's easy to see why she became a star. it's largely because of her that i'd recommended seeing this at least once and why i'm giving this a 4.",0
"i agree strongly with some of the other critics of this film. i found it incredibly silly (at best) and downright misleading, misinforming and harmful (at worst). like others, i found this film to be an awful mix of ""real"" science and pseudoscientific, new age propaganda.   as a psychologist, i was especially offended by candace pert's contributions. true, i was not a fan of hers before this film, but her discourse on the ""consciousness"" of cells was one of the best examples of taking a term (""consciousness"") that has a predictable meaning to most people and using it in such a distorted manner as to cause it to obscure rather than clarify. it is an old orwellian mind-f**k that the master himself described so well in his superb essay ""politics and the english language."" to refer to ""consciousness"" in this manner--indeed, to refer to this film as ""based in science"" in general (which is its clear intent)--is to use language in the same manner employed by stalin when he labeled his slave-states ""democratic republics"" and hitler when he called his party a ""socialist workers"" movement.  i don't claim to really understand quantum physics. i know enough about it to know that to really understand it would take considerable study. ah, but we americans do love ""instant enlightenment,"" and that's what this mistake of a film tries to accomplish. if it asked questions, that would be one thing, but it clearly attempts to ask and answer them, which no film could possibly do simply because we are far, far away from the answers (if they indeed exist).  by the way, ethically this film needed a disclaimer about the association of several ""expert commentators"" with the maharishi mahesh yogi (and tm), not to mention j.z. knight, who often speaks in her ""ramtha"" voice. (i'm always amazed at this channeled 10,000 year-old atlantean superman's grasp of 21st century concepts and terminology. but then again, this film argues that the past, present and future are all one and the same, so if ramtha existed in atlantis 10,000 years ago, i suppose he could exist now and tomorrow. only, then how come his financial advice has been so incredibly bad for his followers? oh, i forgot, i'm the creator of ""good"" and ""bad"" advice, so it's all my fault, not ramtha's.)  what a mess.",0

"after the glories of the snare, it was unlikely that a further outing for hanzo would be able to do any better, and this doesn't breach that expectation, but it is a fine film and sits neatly in between the fun but messy first chapter and the terrific second in terms of quality and general entertainment. the screenplay comes from yasuzo masumura and has some parallels with the snare, as well as the expected hi-jinks of a hanzo film, but the film rings nice little changes on the formula by amping up the character driven humour as well as giving the film a quieter, reflective edge. the film opens with hanzos assistants scared by a ghost, and typically he decides straight away that he needs to have carnal knowledge of this ghost. it turns out that the ghost is serving as a guard for a stash of stolen coins and from this set-up unfolds a story of theft, corruption and usury, with expected violent and sleazy results. shintaro katsu is terrific as expected as hanzo, coming across effortlessly as a deadly fighter and sexual force of nature, he is equally good in the moments of knowing humour and likable, almost an ordinary gentleman in moments of drama, it is a beautifully rounded performance filled with social conscience and a touching edge of personal feeling. the expected comedy comes off fine as well, his moments with ""snake"" magobei are perhaps the most amusing of the series whilst his interactions with his servants are kookily entertaining as ever. though neatly laden throughout with nice moments, a fair amount of action and a little sleaze, the film does lose a little from a relatively restrained approach. there are shades of both prior films, the plotting, pace and smarts recall the snare and when the film aims for sleaze it does very well, with a potently handled and impactful early interrogation sequence. equally though, director yoshio inoue presents potentially sleazy scenes in a more experimental way as per kenji misumi's less well handled work in sword of justice, with consequences sometimes very nice, as with a man playing a tune on the koto, with close ups of his fingers plucking at the strings as unbeknownest to him hanzo ploughs his wife, and sometimes a bit weak, as with an orgy that is reduced to a nudity free psychedelic whirl of limbs in motion that just looks confusing. the nudity and bloodshed is generally downplayed which is a pity, though there is a little of both a stronger approach would have worked better, it is definitely the sort of film where trashy and unrestrained nudity and violence are most appropriate. but even with less in the way of exploitative goods this is still thoroughly entertaining stuff, the predictable moments are wrought with aplomb and there is more than enough intrigue and excitement, even some effective surprises to go around. its a film for the fans really, playing off the work laid down in the previous instalments and working sweetly if not spectacularly with it. altogether a near wholly pleasurable if mildly flawed end to a delightful trilogy, the second best of them and well worth a watch for enthusiasts of such things.",1

"24 has got to be the best spy/adventure series tv had ever aired. the whole idea of telling a story in a 24 hour real time period is dazzling. the style of filming and pacing is what hooks us to watch it. and jack bauer is one of the greatest protagonists in a tv series in a long time. i rate this, along with the simpsons and the x-files, my three most favorite tv series.  this first episode begins with the conspiracy to assassinate us senator david palmer who is also running for president. bauer is called to his office in order to discover who is behind all this and, at the same time, figure his daughter's path to the unkwown after fleeing from her bedroom. thus, begins an adventure on the best political style and, what's best of it, is that it always takes place in real time, which makes this tv series a real work of originality in a time where almost every program on tv seems to be showing us the same things over and over and over.",1
"this movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in hollywood. the fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business. the idea that audiences paid to see this movie (and like an idiot i rented the film) is discouraging also.  obsessed teacher (3 years prior) kills teenager's family because he wants her. for no reason he kills the mother, father and brother. from the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction. years later, obsessed teacher breaks out of prison. hmm--usual bad writing--no one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute. obsessed teacher somehow becomes like a navy seal and can sneak around, sniff out people and with a knife is super killer. sure!!! now obsessed teacher kills hotel maid for no reason, knifes bellhop for the fun of it, and starts to hunt down the teenager's friends. now there is the perfect way to get the girl to love you. obsessed teacher sneaks out of hotel---again it is stupid, ever cop would know his face--but he walks right by them. now he kills two cops outside teenager's house and somehow sneaks into her bedroom and kills her boyfriend.  there is not one single positive thing about this piece of garbage. if any other profession put out work of this low quality, they would be fired. yet these idiots are making hundreds of thousands of dollars for writing and directing this trash.",0

"a remarkable example of cinematic alchemy at work, with a trite'n'turgid lump of lead script (penned by numbingly mediocre hollywood hack nonpareil jole schumacher, no less) being magically converted into a choice chunk of exquisitely gleaming 24-carat musical drama gold thanks to brisk direction, fresh, engaging performances, spot-on production values, a flavorsome recreation of 50's era new york, an infectiously effervescent roll-with-the-punches tone, and a truly wondrous rhythm and blues score by the great curtis mayfield.  the story, loosely based on the real life exploits of the supremes, prosaically documents the arduous rags-to-riches climb of three bright-eyed, impoverished black teenage girl singers who desperately yearn to escape their ratty, unrewarding ghetto plight and make it big in the razzle-dazzle world of commercial r&b music. all the obvious pratfalls of instant wealth and success -- egos run destructively amok, drugs, corruption, fighting to retain your integrity, and so on -- are predictably paraded forth, but luckily the uniformly excellent work evident in the film's other departments almost completely cancels out schumacher's flat, uninspired plotting. the first-rate acting helps out a lot. irene cara, lonette mckee, and dwan smith are sensationally sexy, vibrant and appealing leads -- and great singers to boot. comparably fine performances are also turned in by a charmingly boyish pre-""miami vice"" philip michael thomas as the group's patient, gentlemanly manager, dorian harewood as mckee's venal, aggressively amorous hound dog boyfriend, and perennial blaxploitation baddie tony (""hell up in harlem,"" ""bucktown"") king as a dangerously seductive, smooth operating, stone cold nasty gangster. the tone dips and dovetails from funny and poignant to melancholy and blithesome without ever skipping a beat, deftly evolving into a glowing, uplifting ode to the human spirit's extraordinary ability to effectively surmount extremely difficult and intimidating odds.  veteran editor sam o'stern acquits himself superbly in his directorial debut. bruce surtees' luminescent cinematography and gordon scott's expert editing are both flawless. o'stern's firm grasp of period atmosphere, keen eye for tiny, but telling little details, and unerring sense of busy, unbroken pace are just as impressive. no fooling about curtis mayfield's impeccable soundtrack contributions, either. ""jump,"" ""what can i do with this feeling,"" ""givin' up,"" ""take my hand precious lord,"" ""lovin' you baby,"" and ""look into your heart"" are all terrifically tuneful, soulful, almost unbelievably fantastic songs, with the sweetly sultry love jones number ""something he can feel,"" which was later covered by both aretha franklin and en vogue, clearly copping top musical honors as the best-ever song in the entire movie. the net result of all these above cited outstanding attributes persuasively illustrates that sometimes it's not the screenplay so much as what's done with said script which in turn determines a film's overall sterling quality.",1
this is a great movie for all ages. its the story about three animals how have to find their way home. there is a bit of a twist at the end and mainly throughout the whole movie. you never know what is going to happen next. this movie makes you cry and makes you laugh. you just don't know what going to happen next. the trek home is all beautiful with all the wonderful wildlife scenes. they producers also spent a lot of money for this movie and it shows too. the animals in this movie were well trained and are great actors/actress themselves. everything about this movie is great! 10 out of 10 the whole way! rent or buy it today i can guarantee you will love it the whole family will!,1
"i'm gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this. however, the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies. it's definitely something that most people will not get, as is the nature of absurdism.  the animation is horrible, but yes, that's the point. the main character is foul mouthed, violent, and stupid. no redeeming qualities whatsoever. his wife shrieks and wails, apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills. most of these stories completely lack any kind of point.  but again, that's the point ;)  if non sequiters, foul language, and complete and utter randomness are your thing, you're going to love this.  it is really short, so i would probably rent instead of buying.",1
"this film's trailer interested me enough to warrant renting the dvd. however, the resulting movie is absolutely dire! admittedly, this is not the worst film ever made, or the worst film this year, but it came damn close!  the main issue is the film not knowing what it wants to be: comedy, adult drama, thriller, teen-porn? the story is interesting, as it deals with the pitfalls of mail-order brides, but the film is a mess. what starts out as a mildly interesting ""comedy"" (a word i use in the loosest possible terms), then goes totally in reverse, and degenerates into a very dark and distasteful misogynistic thriller. nicole kidman should know better, and ben chaplin is wasted! as are matthieu kassovitz and vincent cassel, whom i can only presume did this for the money.  this is a bad film in pretty much every single aspect. it's not funny, it's almost so sexist that you could almost forgive benny hill for everything he did, and the dramatic elements are just downright nasty. a film to be avoided, unless you absolutely have to see kidman or chaplin in every one of their films!",0
"the tighter the drama, the better the film of sister rivalry! this little gem was mainly promoted as a comedy upon its release in sweden, so i'm glad to find that wasn't the whole case. funny bits on small-town bickering are there to enjoy, surely, but the drama takes center stage, as the story progresses. and not just family drama, it also raises poignant questions on respecting differences of peoples' lifestyle choices.  great character ensemble with many superb and moving dramatic scenes that score credibility points; and they're not just scattershot, but hold everything in place. it just makes me assume that if ingmar bergman had made this (the drama would suit him!), the international attention probably would have been immediate.  7 out of 10 from ozjeppe.",1
"well not actually. this movie is very entertaining though. went and saw it with the girlfriend last night and had to use the ""i think there might be something in my eye"" routine. the movie is a great combination of comedy and typical romance. jim carey is superb as a down on his luck reporter who is given the power to change himself and the city in which he resides. in fact all the characters are great. the movie is not overly funny or sappy, good flick to go see with the wife.  all in all 8/10....note * i am not an easy grader. thats all from bigv over and out!",1
"saw this movie when it first came out in the 1970's and hated, hated, hated it! easily the most booooring movie i have ever seen in my life. don't know where leigh got his inspiration but this is one of those movies where you want to shake the characters to get them to open their mouths and communicate. the title says it all because there are no saving moments in this movie, just long, long silences with people unable to articulate what they are (presumably) feeling. if you want to watch something that will drive you to drink then this is the one for you. if you have nothing better to do for two hours then stick a fork in a toaster: the experience will be infinitely more pleasurable than anything you will get from this! yes, leigh came up with a lot of really worthwhile stuff much later in his career but give this one a miss.",0
"greetings again from the darkness. what ever happened to the great barry levinson? he directed two of my all-time favorites in ""avalon"" and ""diner"". he had some fine movies as well (""rainman""), but always provided something of interest ... until now. i believe the worst thing you can ever say about a comedy is that it is boring. ""envy"" is the definition of boring. never of big fan of pure slap stick (""dumb and dumber""), i was just stunned at how god-awful this movie is. there are maybe 2 chuckles in the whole thing - if you can pay attention that long. the best part of the film is the running gag of the title song by a redbone sound-alike. if the film had been written as well as the song, it would have been tolerable. rachel weisz is a wonderful actress and i realize they all want to do comedy (even julianne moore), but the real world exposes one weaknesses. snl cast member amy poehler is her usual over the top in her role as trailer park trash turned princess. the disaster of the film is jack black and ben stiller. the first work commute together flashes some promise, but after that their chemistry disappears due to the poor script. this script is like most of jack black's character's ideas - not a bad thought, but no hope for success.",0
"it is a great tragedy that both richard harris and john derek are no longer with us. but that shouldn't blind anybody to the fact that in 1981, a pretty ugly blotch appears on both men's cvs. no doubt john derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what 'some like it hot' and 'one million years bc' did for maryln monroe and raquel welsh respectively, creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade. having run to embrace dudley moore on the beach in '10' bo's reputation, an all-star cast and location filming in sri lanka meant that nothing could go wrong. alas, as they say, mortals plan and god laughs. it is said that when this film premiered in 1981, the edgar rice burrows estate tried to take legal action against it. bo derek plays jane parker who sets off into turn-of-the century africa to be reunited with her boozy, abusive dad, richard harris. daddy parker is an explorer who has set out to find 'the great inland sea' the stuff of local legend, whose existence has been poo-pooed by conventional wisdom. harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy, tanked -up performance which includes singing an irish ditty at an indian elephant that somehow found its way into africa (did it arrive at the same time as the orang-utan from sumatra???) furthermore, although jane professes to despise parker, bo and rich's relationship is creepily incestuous, testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat. before long, however, local legends start to circulate about a 'great white ape' and jane hears the famous yodel. this is the movie's cue for miles o'keefe, a future b-movie star, making a rather odd debut as the loin-clothed lord of the jungle. unlike johnny weismuller with his pidgin english or ron ely who speaks the language fluently, the o'keefe tarzan is mute. given some of bo and richie's dialog, though, this is probably not a bad thing. harris and his caravan eventually reaches the great inland sea, located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across africa....hang on, aren't seas, lakes and other watery places generally located in low-lying areas?? nevermind, it is just one of many anomalies in the john derek universe. the crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap, harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths. on another occasion, jane decides to take a nude swim by the inland sea, giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity. out of nowhere a single male lion appears. now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on, tarzan will be wrestling with a (venomous) boa constrictor. zoology doesn't seem to have been one of john derek's strong points..... this being a tarzan movie, jane becomes enchanted with the lord of the jungle and resolves to take his virginity. but having seen his closeness to some of those chimps, you do have to wonder...speaking of which, it's not only the edgar rice burroughs estate could have sued. it is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers: the chimps here make you miss cheeta badly. especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when tarzan and jane finally get it on! the climax of this film has bo and harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrifice/eat/execute her. suffice is to say that the great wooden ape gets his girl and *spoiler* harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk! this doesn't stop the dying parker from delivering a rambling monologue to jane. as far as i am aware, the law suit from the rice burrows estate never materialized but 'tarzan the ape man' was crucified at the box office (no kidding?) a pity. john derek could have directed 'tarzan the ape man 2' with bo derek and miles o'keefe living in domestic bliss and dudley moore as 'boy.'",0
"so...we get so see added footage of brando...interesting but not exactly oscar worthy stuff. susannah york was hardly a slouch. new scene where lois finds out clark is superman is slightly unbelievable in that he doesn't notice that there are blanks coming out of the gun instead of real bullets. real bullets would have penetrated his clothes and then bounced off him onto the floor but forget that...let's listen to donner make fun of lester's version that made more logical sense. the president talks of the zod ""defacing"" the washington monument when it was originally mount rushmore. tweaking that scene made that line quite absurd. superman's ""freedom of the press"" line sounded silly compared to ""..care to step outside"" which was delivered better and had a fitting connection to clark's earlier scene in the truck stop. then there is the ending with the ""turn back the world to go back in time"" effect. it turned back everything in the whole movie and made you wonder where exactly the rocket aimed for hackensack, n.j. ever went since it doesn't free zod and company any more.",0
"i was lucky enough to see this at a pre-screening last night (oct. 20) and i was incredibly surprised by the wonderful plot and genuinely heart felt acting.  while the plot is not particularly complicated or exceptionally new, the story unfolds in a way that feels fresh, unique, and distinctly ""indy"" in style. it isn't something that can easily be compared to films of the past, it's a unique take on a sort of classic middle-aged depressed love story.  i was particularly struck by the casting of the film. down to every last extra in the family, it was a beautiful and talented cast. the three daughters did a wonderful job, the talent was evenly dispersed between them and none of them ""out-shone"" the other two.  it was truly a delightful film, appropriate for all ages and laugh out loud funny while also being truly touching and heart warming. it was a wonderful break from the sex jokes and nudity of recent films.",1
"i don't think any player in hollywood history lasted as long as david niven did given most of the weak films he had to carry by dint of his incredible charm. he could act, got an oscar for it, but most of the material he did was as light as one ply of two ply tissue paper.  happy go lovely is a case in point. it's a musical and for the most part you'll remember vera-ellen's dancing. you'll remember that they are in scot's costume as the film is set in edinburgh during their festival. but if you can recall a single song from it you must have a photographic memory.  the plot is light. vera-ellen is the american lead in a musical that apparently is getting its out of town tryout in edinburgh. she starts in the chorus and runs late one day. she gets a lift from the chauffeur of a millionaire greeting card king. everybody now assumes she's the main squeeze of the millionaire. doors open up as they've never opened before.  the millionaire is david niven and he goes along with it and the various situations that are engendered by the mistake. cesar romero has some good moments here as the frantic producer of this musical.  in the end though happy go lovely is light and harmless fluff which david niven did so much of and got so tired of.",0
"hubert selby jr. gave us the book ""requiem for a dream"" and co-wrote the screenplay to aronofsky's movie of it. that movie succeeded on every level by delivering an intimate, and unbiased portrait of the horrors of the characters lives and the vices that destroyed them. ""last exit to brooklyn"" still has the vice and the multiple characters living sad lives, but it hardly does them the same justice aronofsky did.  the film seems laughably anti-gay at times. especially when in the film homosexuality equals death. one gay character gets stoned, is launched skyward by a speeding car, and lands dead on the pavement. another is crucified and still more are simply beat up. another exaggerated piece of shock value, that might actually have been compelling if it were done well, are scenes of the union workers literally doing battle with the strike-breakers. who'd have thought a drama about brooklyners would feature action sequences and truck explosions?  the director, uli edel has a skill level like that of a tv director, but he is far below the cut for real movies. the film is clunky that can't even seem to settle on a genre. lake is given a useless role that any mannequin could have filled and baldwin only seems to know how to look stupid in his equally meager part. and then comes jennifer jason leigh as our lead, a loathsome hooker named tralala (believe it or not, i'm not joking). her performance is nothing great and the fate of her character is dirty to say the least. poor use of color and composition make it look cheaper than it is, and also takes the ""real"" edge off the more provocative bits. a failure.",0
"like his earlier film, ""in a glass cage"", agustí villaronga achieves an intense and highly poetic canvas that is even more refined visually than its predecessor. this is one of the most visually accomplished and haunting pictures one could ever see. the heightened drama, intensity and undertone of violence threatens on the the melodramatic or farcical, yet never steps into it. in that way, it pulls off an almost impossible feat: to be so over-the-top and yet so painfully restrained, to be so charged and yet so understated, and even the explosives finales are virtuosic feasts of the eye. unabashed, gorgeous, and highly tense... this film is simply superb!",1
"a movie that attempts to be far smarter than its makers are capable of producing. the movie twists and turns through miriad plot ""surprises"" at a desperate attempt to kep the audience guessing, offcourse puncturing the ""plot"" with steamy scenes they thought would help it along.  james belushi is involved in this pseudo-intellectual attempt and just sleep walks through the movie. the same applies for the other ""actors"". the plot is quite silly and tacky. whih in itelf is not such a crime, but towards the end, the tremendous plot-twists get very tiresome and boring.  however, the movie does manage to generate some interest in the middle. in all worth a lazy watch on a really boring day, but don't fret if you miss this one.  a rather lame 4!",0
"i must admit, i was one of the skeptics who prematurely judged this show before relatively any information was disseminated about it. i determined that it was going to be a cheap spin-off guided by ronald d. moore wielding the retcon-wand.  i was wrong!  the pilot leaves an excellent impression upon the viewers. the accessibility is marvelous! of course, seasoned bsg veterans will find themselves immersed in the plot, which is focused on the development of the cylons before the first war. (58 years before the events of the bsg pilot). the pilot also allows for newcomers, clearly presenting its plot and ideas in the first part of the episode.  don't be mistaken: ""caprica"" is not bsg. we are presented with an immersive, cerebral drama dotted by provocative, daring, and controversial ideas.   the casting maintains bsg's standards; stoltz and morales are simply astounding. morales' portrayal of joseph adama, inspired by olmos' portrayal of william, gives a wonderful glimpse of william's heroic father. stoltz's portrayal of dr. graystone provokes a lot of thinking and questions.  if the quality of the pilot is any indication of what's yet to come, rdm and the creative team are set to continue bsg's legacy of first-rate television programming with another masterfully created television masterpiece.",1
"everyone has already commented on the cinematography (good to great), the personalities (larger than life), the structure (chronological, with many references to surf culture through time). what is missed is a bigger question of sociological importance: chucking mainstream american culture for something more fulfilling and rewarding.  i was a surfer in the 1970s. we used to watch 16mm films at the local high schools in socal. i remember the great feeling of surfing all day until my skin radiated heat, putting on a hawaiian shirt and shorts and going to watch the latest surf film at night. often, the narrator was the filmmaker himself, reading a script off sheets of paper. sometimes, a surf band or proto-punk band would add music. i was never happier. except for the hooting and hollering, seeing 'riding giants' took me back in time.  it also reinforced a feeling that living life on the edge, not worrying about the money and the climbing the social and corporate ladder, not keeping up with the joneses, pushing yourself physically and mentally for a fleeting moment of joy and jubilation - may be the answer to the question, ""what is the purpose of life?"" at least for those like greg noll, laird hamilton and the like, they seem to have found something that few of us are bold enough or honest with ourselves enough to pursue: to live life solely on our own terms. maybe society would fall apart if we all did exactly what we wanted in life, but it is wonderful to see people who actually are living out their dreams.  it was this message that really impressed me.",1
"musically speaking irving berlin gave fred astaire and ginger rogers another pluperfect musical after top hat if that was possible. although in this case like that jerome kern confection roberta that they were in, follow the fleet retained randolph scott with another singer, this time harriet hilliard.  randolph scott is a career navy cpo and fred astaire is an ex-vaudevillian who enlisted in the navy to forget ginger rogers his former partner. but now the two are on shore leave. fred and ginger take up right where they left off, and randy accidentally meets ginger's dowdy sister harriet who blossoms into a real beauty. but randy's a typical love 'em and leave 'em sailor.   again irving berlin wrote a hit filled score with him tightly supervising the production. ginger gets to do some really outstanding vocalizing with let yourself go which she and fred later dance to. but the real hit of the show is let's face the music and dance which is a number done at a navy show. sung first by astaire and later danced to by the pair, let's face the music and dance is one of the great romantic numbers ever written for the screen. their dancing on this one is absolute magic.  i'm sure that when i mention harriet hilliard a few younger people might ask who that was. but they will know immediately when i mention her in conjunction with her famous husband ozzie nelson. that's right ozzie and harriet. it's something of a mystery to me why harriet stopped singing when she just became david and ricky's mom on television. then again she didn't even keep her own name.   neither ozzie or harriet sang on television. ozzie was a pale imitation of rudy vallee as a singer, but harriet could really carry a tune. she sings get thee behind me satan and the moon and i are here, but where are you, both with real feeling and class. i recommend you see follow the fleet if for no other reason than to hear a dimension of harriet hilliard incredibly forgotten today.",1

"yes, the cameras were in the right place at the right time. it's so interesting to see how a world leader (like chavez) who supports the poor people in his country, can be held in such low esteem in the us. his worst ""sin"", in my opinion, is caring about those who are at the bottom of the barrel. what can be so bad about that? i have always been fascinated by the us government+media reaction to fidel castro. at first, castro was a good guy (around 1959) when he supplanted batista. soon, however, castro started turning the corporations in cuba toward the needs of the poor instead of the fat cats. we're a decent country, but why does our media and government have such a problem with sharing with the poor? if these guys are ""dictators,"" then we could use more ""dictatorships"" especially where the poorest of the poor live in the world.",1
"i was not nearly as smitten with this as many other reviewers. sure, it has a pair of lovely girls playing erotic, lesbian vampires. marianne morris and anulka d. play these two lovely sirens with razor teeth that run up to cars on a road out of the way, hitch to their home(at dusk), and invite their prey...sex-starved men to their boudoir. what happens there...well, after they disrobe and kiss each other mostly, they kill their visitors. director jose ramon larraz does have some flashes of brilliance with his camera. some scenes are quite eerie and effectively shot, but sex alone does not hold a film up(no pun intended...at least consciously). there really isn't much of a story here. we have the two girls. we are shown some inexplicable and unexplained beginning where we see them shot with pistol. why? what does it mean"" why do we have the guy that stays for several days greet a guy at the hotel that insists he knows him from years ago? does that have a purpose? of course i have even more general questions like what is a couple of nice-looking girls doing as vampires in the english countryside and having a wine cellar filled with wine from the carpathians? anyway, the script is riddled with such flaws. it is also very sparse on the action outside of catch victims, wine and dine them(quite literally), and then go to bed in the crypt. the end gets going with some juicier scenes, but it is anti-climatic. there are, as i said, some effective scenes by the director...i particularly liked the way the girls dressed and were filmed in the woods looking for their prey. the house is also a most impressive set. and both girls are as i said very lovely. marianne morris in particular stands out - in more ways than one. for you older film fans, silent screen veteran bessie love has a brief cameo at film's end.",0
"q.e.d. was a brilliant tv series and it truly was one of the very few worth scheduling for! i suspect that in this era of tivo and recording devices that it would fare much better than it did in 1982. i am eagerly awaiting its availability on dvd!  while it is true that it has some in common with other television shows like the wild, wild west, the bearcats and the adventures of brisco county, jr., all of which i am a huge fan of,q.e.d. had a much more intellectual quality to it. it did not suffer for that, however - the dialog was witty and the action was high. the show ran in the uk as mastermind, and it did have something of the bbc feel to it, but with better production values than bbc typically had in that era.  i was a nineteen year old lad when this series ran initially, and had much too much to do in my life to make time for television. i remember my dear mother, however, calling me to remind me that q.e.d. was on, and we would sit on the phone and watch it together. wonderful memories.  truly, q.e.d. is a sad loss and, if it could be done with the same quality and values today, i would love to see it make a return.",1
"patrick channing (jeff kober) is a disciple of satan / serial killer who possesses the ""first power"": even after being captured by detective russell logan (lou diamond phillips) and executed in the gas chamber, he is able to move his spirit from body to body and continue to murder at will. with the help of attractive psychic tess seaton (tracy griffith, melanie g.'s half-sister) he attempts to stop channing.  this concept probably had some possibilities, i think, but ultimately ""the first power"" suffers from routine scripting and film-making. this is nothing we haven't seen before, sometimes done better. there is nothing about this movie to distinguish it from other supernatural horror thrillers. more to the point, it's not very thrilling and it certainly isn't scary. phillips is a hard sell as a tough-as-nails, cynical cop stereotype, and griffith doesn't seem to be trying very hard; best cast member is probably the distinctively featured kober, doing his best to be supremely creepy.  the climax is rather silly and the ending very weak.  not really even acceptable enough to rate as an average film of its kind, therefore:  4/10",0
"having watched this movie on the scifi channel, i can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives. the film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences, or ""delights"" as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me. the plot isn't really worth commenting as, but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into yeti territory. before the movie is over, we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out, yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters, yetis ripping a man's legs off and beating him with them, a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin, a yeti surviving several bullets and being set on fire with no apparent harm, a yeti dangling off a cliff by holding to a man's shoe, yet then jumps off, and a whole collection of further, bizarre occurrences. basically, if you aren't staying up on a saturday for the expressed purpose of watching the worst of scifi channel original movies, avoid this film like the plague. or as my friend reading over my shoulder says: ""it's the best movie i have ever seen."" to which the friend on my right says: ""only battle techno music could have made it better.""",0

"hi, im scott (a.k.a woody7739) i love the film twisted desire, and i love watching melissa joan hart on the t.v as i think she is fine. i am a real fan of sabrina the teenage witch too, so this helped my watch it (don't ask). i love the way that nicole plans out her parents murder very carfully, as she makes sure that someone else pulls the trigger and practices on the bottles, so she wont give away her fingerprints (a very well planned out idea), back i guess it all backfired on nicole as she got caught as her old boyfriend comes along and puts a hidden camera under his shirt. i give this film a nine out of ten, and put it in my top 10 films list. and last but not least if anyone see's this film in the shops please tell me as i seen it on tv and didn't record it. bye",1
"great cgi effects & a truly oscar-worthy performance by gary sinise as lt. dan.   tom hanks is a one-trick pony in this movie, how he got the best actor oscar that year over morgan freeman was a crime.   this movie is a pandering treacly love letter to the baby boom generation, with a barely concealed right-wing prejudice, beginning from forrest's service in vietnam all the way through to the ""resolution"" with jenny at the end.  with that said, though, it is hugely entertaining and an american movie through and through. i found certain parts of this film exceedingly offensive, zemeckis dumbs down this movie almost to the level of gump himself . . .maybe that was the point he was trying to make.  watch this film and ask yourself ""what is robert zemeckis saying about what makes a good american?""   forrest seems to have made the ""right"" choices and been at the ""right place at the right time"" for the last 45 years. those who are wrong according to the director's vision seem to pay a heavy price. so is zemeckis saying that idiocy disguised as innocence and naivety is a patriotic, even american quality?",0
"partially from the perceived need, one feels, to include a conventional love story in the plot to make the film more marketable to a 1950's movie-going public.   the film starts with some wickedly funny characterizations of the upper-class bureaucrats running the foreign office --- the british are pilloried in the way that only the british can pillory themselves. but after that, the film loses its way in a conventional farcical plot. terry-thomas watchable as always, but the great talent in the cast (peter sellers, et al) is largely wasted.  a diverting, but not great film.",1
"mardi gras: made in china is an excellent movie that depicts how two cultures have much in common but, are not even aware of the influence each society has on one another. david redmon open your eyes and allows you to see how the workers in china manufactures beads that cost little to nothing and are sold in america for up to 20 dollars. when redmon questions americans about where these beads come from they had no clue and seemed dumb founded. when he told them that they are made in china for less then nothing with horrible pay and unacceptable working conditions, americans seemed sad, hurt, and a little remorseful but didn't really seem that they would stop purchasing the beads after finding out the truth. when redmon questioned the workers in china they did not know that americans were wearing them over their necks and paid so much for these beads. the workers laughed at what the purpose was behind beads and couldn't believe it. this movie is a great film that gives us something to think about in other countries besides our own.  m. pitts",1
"not even bob hope, escorted by a raft of fine character actors, can save this poorly written attempt at wartime comedy, as his patented timing has little which which to work. the plot involves a hollywood film star named don bolton (hope), and his attempt to evade military service at the beginning of world war ii, followed by his enlistment by mistake in a confused attempt to court a colonel's daughter (dorothy lamour). bolton's agent, played by lynne overman, and his assistant, portrayed by eddie bracken, enlist with him and the three are involved in various escapades regarding training exercises, filmed in the malibu, california, hills. paramount budgeted handsomely for this effort, employing some of its top specialists, but direction by the usually reliable david butler was flaccid, and this must be attributed to a missing comedic element in the scenario. a shift toward the end of the film to create an opportunity for heroism by bolton is still-born with poor stunt work and camera action in evidence. oddly, lynne overman is given the best lines and this veteran master of the sneer does very well by them. dorothy lamour looks lovely and acts nicely, as well, and it is ever a delight to see and hear clarence kolb, as her father, whose voice is unique on screen or radio, but there is little they can do to save this film, cursed as it is with an error in script assignment.",0

"it' just funny, watch it!!!   ok they want 10 lines so there: this is a spoof of 50s/70s werewolf movies. lots of satire, some political. feels like an early clouseau movie (probably due to alan arkin), but with less slap stick. if you like the naked guns movies you'll like this too (once again less slapstick in this one).   actually, the humor ranges from light sexual innuendo (unavoidable in a teen comedy), to really poignant socio-political satire. the transformation of the moon high school from 50s to 70s is really funny. the sequence with the changing presidential portraits is brilliant! ok maybe not brilliant but still hilarious. there are tons of (histarical) cracks starting from the 50s cold war paranoia and the late 70s inflation.  anyway, just watch the movie if you get a chance!",1

"this movie bewilders me. it may be that i'm just a stupid american, but i really just don't get 400 blows. everything i've read about this movie has been a total rave, but i just couldn't stay interested. i'm sure that it was as revolutionary in film-making as all the critics say, but when it boils right down to it, it's just really really boring. maybe it's the language barrier, may i'm just not ""sensitive"" or ""artsy"" enough, but whatever the case is, i hated this movie. the story itself isn't bad; it's about a young french boy who is treated unfairly by his parents and his teachers, and eventually he ends up in a juvenile facility. that in itself ought to be interesting, and it was, at first. there was nothing wrong with the dialogue, but then again it's hard to say because half of the conversations weren't subtitled and for no apparent reason, so i didn't always know what was going on. but for the dialogue we could understand, it made enough sense. the actors were believable enough, but it's hard to say what a real person would do in these situations. so you feel for the main character, but only in the sense that when he gets into trouble you think, well that sucks. the plot isn't even your typical plot. each time he gets in trouble, he gets into more trouble than the last time, but the reasons never vary too much. and through the entire film you realize that there's nothing the main character can really do about it. so it's more like just waiting to see how it ends. the ending, by the way, was completely over my head. it's way too artsy for me, and i just didn't get it. leading up to the end was easy enough to follow. the structure was certainly there, and it made sense as well, but everything was really drawn out. for the amount of dialogue and significant moments, the movie could have been an hour shorter. it just didn't end. part of it was the unnecessarily long shots, none of which were especially memorable; for example, the ending was a clip of the main character running down a country road that lasted a good thirty seconds. now, i'm sure that had some deeper meaning in it somewhere, but for the average viewer, i'd rather have gotten up to get some more food during that time. or at least done something a little more useful than sit and watch this boy running, like doing my laundry, or taking a nap.   final verdict   the feeling throughout the whole movie was that this probably would be very moving and just amazing and that it would teach me some great life lesson, if i could only get what the director was trying to say by his unique decisions. as it was, i just felt cheated out of a good two hours of my life.",0

"every now and again you hear radio djs inviting listeners to nominate movies that the listener can't stand or never watched all the way through. this is the movie that i think of...days later.  it's got something to do with a play by shakespeare. not sure, but i think i bailed on this movie some 20 odd minutes into it...think i realised that my toenails wouldn't clip themselves, and they were looking at me imploringly to get cut.  this movie just seemed boring and pretentious to me.  even though this is the first movie i've given such a low score to (which i've actually attempted to watch), i wouldn't want to put you off other movies by it's english director, peter greenaway. i remember thinking that his ""the cook, the thief, his wife and her lover"" was a truly great british film even though its content was at times stomach churning-a brilliant movie, but i can understand why people would balk at seeing it.  another good film by greenaway was ""a zed and two noughts"". again, it had some content that pushed the boundaries of good taste, but was intriguing nonetheless.  the other film that i usually think of too late for such radio show topics is ""brazil"". never managed to watch that all the way through either-kept falling asleep!  unless you have a taste for self-important movies which are off-puttingly highly stylised, laboriously paced and difficult to follow, then steer clear of prosero's books.",0

"yes, this is a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun! that's because although the film clearly was horror, some of the stories had a light spirit--and there were even occasionally a few laughs. this isn't at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious. because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good, it's one of the better movies of this style i have seen.  the unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself. four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenants.  the first segment starred denholm elliott as a horror writer who has writer's block. so, for a change of scenery, they rent this house. almost immediately elliott's block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer. amazingly, soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character! again and again, the psychotic killer appears and then disappears--making it seem as if he is losing his mind. this might just be the best of the stories, as the nice twist ending makes the story come alive.  the second, while not bad at all, is probably the weakest. peter cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago (though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary). when he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town, he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this. later, a friend (joss ackland) visits and he, too, sees the figure and is entranced by it. this all leads to an ending that, frankly, was a bit of a letdown.  christopher lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl. during most of this segment, lee seemed like an idiot, but in the end you can understand his demeanor. though slow, this one ended very well.  the fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre. jon pertwee (the third ""doctor"" from the dr. who television series) is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of dracula. however, nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique, he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film. it's actually pretty interesting that he played this role, as it seemed like a natural for christopher lee who played dracula or other vampires a bazillion times (give or take a few). i enjoyed pertwee's line when he basically said that lee's and other recent incarnations of dracula were all crap compared to bela lugosi's! perhaps this is why lee didn't take this part! despite some very silly moments, it was very entertaining and fun--possibly as good or better than the first segment.  considering that the film started and ended so well, had excellent acting and writing, it's hard not to like this film.",1
"this is a very strange film by director/animator richard williams. all who know of william's work know it's a bit off-kilter (if not ingenious) but this one takes the cake.  it features two hapless ragdolls who have to save their owner's new french doll from a lustful pirate toy and find themselves at the mercy of several bizarre characters along the way. the strength in this movie lies primarily in its aesthetic quality; its strange character designs, its powerful animation, and its stark contrast of the sweet and scary. williams' brilliant animation portrayed raggedy ann and andy as real rag dolls, floppy and darned, rather than simple cartoon versions of the dolls, which made it more believable (at least in a visual sense). the animation shines on the bring us the camel-with-the-wrinkled-knees, whose body walks with two different personalities controlling each end, the silent-movie chase with sir leonard looney and, of course, the greedy.  the greedy animation, on its own, is possibly the most exquisite psychedelic animation i've ever seen. there's something about this animation that just makes your jaw drop--and every second it's something new. living in what was deemed ""the taffy pit,"" the greedy is a massive blob man that lives in and mercilessly eats sweets. he sings a song that i can't help but feel hold some sexual undertones, then tries to kill raggedy ann for her candy heart.  the only complaint i have about this film is that there are too many songs. it continuously bogs down the movie's pace because there are sixteen of them. there are about six good songs (which should have been the only ones) including ""i look, and what do i see?"", ""no girl's toy"", ""blue"" (though they didn't need to make him sing it twice), ""i never get enough"", ""because i love you"" and maybe ""i'm home."" the others just seem unnecessary and frankly aren't too amazing to listen to.  this is a weird film with strange undertones, but if that's what you're looking for, you won't find better.",1

"ladislas starewicz's curiosity with insects and cinema melds into a short film about a love triangle between mr. beetle, an artistic grasshopper, and mrs. beetle. the rather simple story of an adulterous beetle couple that both seek stimulation outside their marriage is similar to a biograph or vitagraph short of the time. starewicz's twist on the story is to use embalmed beetles with wires straightening the legs in frame-by-frame animation. the story builds as mr. beetle is unknowingly caught on camera with a dragonfly from the local nightclub by a jealous grasshopper. when mr. beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, he chases her around angrily, but eventually forgives her and takes her out to see a movie. however, mrs. beetle soon learns of her husband's infidelities as the movie they watch is the jealous grasshopper's footage of mr. beetle and the dragonfly together. mrs. beetle thrashes mr. beetle with her umbrella, mr. beetle jumps through the screen, and they both end up in jail after the projector they wreck catches on fire. the insects are placed in humanized settings such as a house or a nightclub, and are given human characteristics of jealousy, anger, lust, and revenge. the insect characters carry briefcases, drive motorcars, and even wear shoes yet they also twitch their antennae and open and close their mandibles as real insects would. the novelty of the story doesn't wear itself out, even after multiple viewings, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly. action happens with intricate detail, but rapidity and a quicker pace of filming is lost in the process. despite its pace, the film is an excellent example of starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended.",1

"this movie is about a very sexy olympic track star who is hired to coach a high school boys' basketball team. similar to goldie hawn's wildcats, it stars cathy lee crosby in the title role, and she does as about as well as the script allows. i think racquel welch would have been a better choice, but considering the film's apparent tv movie budget, they probably couldn't afford her. cathy lee does look great in every shot, but we never get to see her completely nude. the story is pretty predictable, to say the least, offering no surprises. a young and lucky michael biehn has the male lead role. he is the star on the team and also the love interest for cathy lee. keenan wynn has a few amusing scenes as the rich old man who runs the athletic program and doesn't think a woman should coach sports. this point is brought up throughout the film, and, needless to say, is dated. ironically, cathy lee doesn't put her team through any unorthodox practice sessions; she doesn't do anything a male coach wouldn't do. there is a funny subplot involving a tall and not-so-bright player who undergoes hypnosis in order to pass his classes and play like pro basketball player sydney wicks. it looks like everyone had a good time making this film, but the only real reason to see it is for cathy lee crosby. she's not that great an actress, but she has a dazzling smile, beautiful hair, and a very tan body.",0

"holes (2003, dir andrew davis)   when stanley yelnats iv is wrongfully convicted of stealing, he is sent to 'camp green lake'. at this camp, the warden, and her two henchman, mr. sir and dr. pendanski command the campmates to dig holes after hole after hole. but for what reason? stanley plans to find out.  i never really had any intention in watching 'holes', and i must admit, i only really watched the film, because i'm such a fan of shia labeouf, but even if you are not a fan of him, then it doesn't matter. 'holes' is one of those disney film that the whole family can enjoy. the story is lovely written and incorporates a wonderful idea of including flashbacks to the past. these are not distracting and really gives a great back story. all the cast are great. the young stars act well and the addition of jon voight and sigourney weaver are a joy. shia labeouf shows that even at 17, he can act without any flaws. this is one disney film, you definitely would enjoy as a family.  ""i learn from failure."" - stanley yelnats iii (henry winkler)",1
"what can one say about a film that has one of the blackest, most nihilistic, and occasionally most weirdly -i wont say 'sympathetic'..i will say 'charismatic' villains in the history of the cinema, and the best sword fight since flynn and fairbanks were in their heyday? this is an epic about a stubborn, sometimes foolish, incredibly courageous and honest mans fight for his honor and freedom against tyranny. i loved it. john hurt and tim roth were great villains. jessica lange was very moving, tender, and sensual.",1
"""jag är nyfiken  yellow"" is a lot of fun. like at least one other reviewer, i was, on numerous occasions, laughing out loud. yellow is energetic, playful, self-aware, explorative. don't expect bergman here. this movie is about a youth in the early- to mid-60s in sweden and about the issues, read *contradictions*, that the nation and the world were facing. at times yellow appears to be an earnest social-political documentary, with lena, the main character, and others interviewing both common people and politicians (e.g. olaf palme at home). at other times, yellow seems to parody this kind of documentary. all the while, yellow acts as a personal documentary exploring lena's life - her home life, her loves, her political views, her view of herself. she is a complete person  complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. and placed over all of this is the wonderful additional dimension of the director, sjöman, and his crew documenting themselves documenting lena. it is this that, for me, really gives yellow wings. not only do they suddenly appear at some very funny times and in some funny ways, reminding the viewer that this is fiction and artifice, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; they are filming themselves filming themselves. i am reminded of a bjork music video with this same quality  a music video about the making of a music video, ad infinitum, with each iteration getting weirder and more cartoonish. i think sjöman may have had something similar in mind. while ""jag är nyfiken  yellow"" may not be everyone's cup of tea, it is certainly intelligent, witty, refreshing, ebullient, and authentic.",1
"if you liked ""blair with"" you'll like this one. it has the same lousy camera-work and soundtrack, and it has the same non-existent plot and suspenseful moments.  it also has tom savini, so if you like romero's ""dawn of the dead"" or tarantino and rodriguez' ""from dusk till dawn"" you're in for a treat. he is an icon and a very good actor as well.  no, seriously. this movie is definitely the lousiest movie i've seen in a long time, and i've seen quite a few movies -- bad ones as well. i can tell you that i find most horror movies entertaining in some respect, but this was just a pure waste of time.  the only reason why i gave this movie 2 instead of 1, was the naked chicks and the hot action with all the sharp-looking plastic teeth... no, i'm just kidding. i must have missed before i hit ""submit"" on the vote form.  stay away, even though it has sexy girls with teeth on the cover!",0
"i have to say although i despise these kind of shows, shock horror, i'm a girl, i feel i have to express my opinion. i had seen dirty sanchez before i saw jackass and think it way surpasses jackass in terms of programme making. story lines and interviews are inter weaved to create a more interesting show. i saw a few minutes of jackass movie the other night and couldn't believe how poorly put together it was, everything just put in a line joke after joke with no relation between anything. it must have been the quickest easiest show to edit ever, shockingly amateur. while drinking puke isn't really my thing, as far as a substantial entertainment show goes, dirty sanchez is way out of jackass's league.",1
"considering how much money was budgeted for this film, you would expect more from the story as a whole. this could be quite possibly the most worthless movie i have ever watched. there was no real advancement of anything. character development, minimal. plot advancement, maybe. enjoyment, none. i'm not sure what points were even trying to be made. if you want to see a movie where terrorists are kinda good guys, american cia bombs everything that doesn't agree with our opinions, all capitalists are corrupt, and you like to see anything resembling a storyboard advancement accompanied by a death, have at. for those of us who realize that it doesn't take killing off a good guy to make a point, we'll stick to other movies. in summary, this was a horrible attempt at an 'ocean's 11' style hide-the-plot-so-person-has-to- think movie because not only do you not know what's going on, nobody who made the movie did either. home alone 3 was a better cinematic piece.",0
"this filmfour funded sci-fi movie is most definitely a must see. while it takes huge influence from the manchurian candidate and offers nothing new or original plot wise; it's handled with the utmost skill that it comes off as being fresh and inventive, despite it being basically a re-run of an earlier film. it's good to know that films like this are still being made (even if they aren't getting wide releases), and cypher is refreshing for that reason. the plot twists and turns, which gives it an element of paranoia and also serves in keeping the audience on the edge of their seat while trying to figure out the meaning of cypher's mystery. the plot follows morgan sullivan; a bored suburban man that decides to take a job with digicorp that involves him listening to speeches from several rival companies and recording them for reasons, to him, unknown. however, his job is interrupted when he meets a mysterious young lady known as rita...  this film features a number of stark white backgrounds that give it a very surreal edge and blend well with it's apocalyptic imaging of the future. this gives the film a very odd look that sets it apart from the majority of other films of the same type, with it's only real close affiliate being kubrick's a clockwork orange. the plot is also very efficient and ditches character development in favour of the more stylish - and more thrilling - plot developing. you never quite know where you are with the plot, which serves in making it all the more intriguing. the acting is largely good with a largely unknown cast backing up the team of stars; jeremy northam and lucy lui. northam very much looks the part of the quiet and disheartened man at the centre of the tale, and does well with his role. lucy lui is an actress that has a resume that doesn't quite fit her talent, but she has a look about her that just fits this movie.  cypher is far from perfect as some of the sequences are illogical and at times it can be inconsistent; but on the whole, if you want an inventive recent sci-fi film; cypher is the way to go.",1
my girlfriend picked this one; as a southern born and raised african american i found this movie's plot and premise totally without credibility. to believe that class and racial biases would be so easily and comfortably suspended would only come from someone totally unfamiliar with the ante-bellum south. totally absurd !!! i wonder how they got a good actor like harvey keitel and a good actress like andie mcdowell (who being southern knows better) to participate in this crap,0
"white man + progress + industrialization = bad. first nations + nature + animals = good. simple formula. actually, in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo; now it is used to attack it. however, that being said, i think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone. you may not be onside with the movie's rubbishy revisionism of how the west was won, er lost. but anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the western plains. (the movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses in america before the evil white man brought them there). anyway, i liked it. the quality of the animation - especially the opening shot - is incredible.",1
"writer/director bart sibrel bases his work here around a can of film that he says was mistakenly sent to him by nasa. he says it shows the astronauts faking the television footage of their trip to the moon by employing camera tricks. the astronauts were in low earth orbit all the time, and editors on the ground composed this raw footage into just a few seconds of finished film.  unfortunately sibrel's research is so slipshod that he doesn't realize his ""backstage"" footage is really taken in large part from the 30-minute live telecast (also on that reel) that was seen by millions, not hidden away in nasa vaults as he implies. and we have to wonder why sibrel puts his own conspiratorial narration over the astronauts' audio in the footage, because hearing the astronauts in their own words clearly spells out that the astronauts were just testing the camera, not faking footage.  finally, anyone can see the raw footage for themselves without having to buy sibrel's hacked-up version of it. (he shows you more of the zapruder film of jfk's assassination than of his ""smoking gun"".) sibrel thinks he's the only one who's seen it. what's more revealing is the clips from that raw footage that sibrel chose not to use, such as those clearly showing the appropriately distant earth being eclipsed by the window frames and so forth, destroying his claim that mattes and transparencies were placed in the spacecraft windows to create the illusion of a faraway earth.  as with most films of this type, sibrel relies on innuendo, inexpert assumption, misleading commentary, and selective quotation to manipulate the viewer into accepting a conclusion for which there is not a shred of actual evidence.",0
"several features of this film immediately date it. the sound is rather shrill and one realizes what great strides have been accomplished in sound reproduction in the ensuing years. the language of the dialogue is rather quaint and unnatural and the acting is still reminiscent of its transition from the stage techniques.  bette davis always gives a strong performance in all her films as she does in this early period of her very successful career. i do feel however that somehow the cockney accent does not fit the facial expression. i think it is the assumed cockney accent that does not ring true for me.  somerset maughan loves to delve into human relationships of great dramatic intensity which will please all movie-goers. as in so many of her character roles, bette davis can switch from a beautiful seductive woman to a viper full of fiery hatred. leslie howard is well cast as the withdrawn english artist with a club foot desperately seeking a partner and making a bad choice in a scheming little waitress.  towards the end of the film the young doctor meets his true love in a busy street. they cross through the traffic completely oblivious to a multitude of horns and whistles screaming at them. this scene is possibly meant to be funny, but i find it quite ridiculous in this otherwise very serious film. it is probably construed to send you home with a smile on your face. and after all as far as we can see (and hope for) it is a happy ending.",1
"think of this film as a saturday morning live-action program from ages ago. even the small tykes will find this one hard to please because it runs like molasses! i can't fully understand how god awful it is to make something too typical and uninteresting, especially in the costume department! too many warrior-wizard movies out there have used the same old plotline numerous times over, but this is mighty scarce considering its appeal to the little darlings. and who in the world would've let a topless mermaid be cast in the first place? i thought this was a ""family"" movie! mst3k, here's another fine gem for your 1999 tv season!",0
"this sword-&-sorcery story of an appallingly brutal and callous ""hero"" vanquishing an evil king is worthless in almost every detail. the acting is horrible from the leads to the supporting roles. the leering, gloating glee with which the director shows the hero smearing blood around is absolutely disgusting; nor is it redeemed by any justice to his cause, since he is as bad as the people he's fighting. z-movie editing is abundant, including a scene where a character ""dies"" from a sword thrust that very obviously missed completely!  the movie is clearly banking on the charms of the female leads, barbi benton and lana clarkson, who are paraded around mostly naked throughout the movie. as a 20-something male, i will not pretend that female flesh on the screen doesn't attract me. but the treatment of their characters is so degrading and the sex scenes so casual and joyless, that i couldn't enjoy even this aspect of the movie.  most cheesy movies of this era are at least somewhat redeemed by a light-hearted, tongue-in-cheek feel (the sequel is better in this regard), but deathstalker seems to take itself completely seriously as heroic fantasy. no way! avoid at all costs!  rating: 1/2 out of ****.",0

"what a disappointment, especially in light of the budget provided, the technical resources available, and the talent assembled. isn't the fundamental rule for science fiction/drama to create in the audience the willing suspension of disbelief. poa 2001 creates a plausible beginning, suckering us in, but thereinafter mr. burton forgets that his moviegoers have working brains. the over the top libertarian of helena bonham carter's chimp, the worthlessness of the humans' lockup, the ease of their escape, their extraordinary skills of horsemanship (this is an astronaut and a group of human primitives suddenly riding full tilt), the massive and immediate human rebellion all are too unbelievable. mark wahlberg never once projects any sense of real fear, danger or comeuppance in this world turned upside down. compare to the original, in which chuck heston's nakedness metaphorically captured his utter helplessness and astonishment at his turn of events. the uniformed wahlberg preserves his modesty, but also his apparent sense of management and control in an inherently wacky situation, and we never really wonder about his well being. unlike heston, he seems never to be in real jeopardy. tim burton should have used some of the f/x budget for some competent screenwriting. in fact, after this inferior fiasco, i wonder why hollywood's producers ever bothered to settle the screenwriters and directors strike threats. let them walk. trained monkeys could have done as well as they did in planet of the apes 2001. i'll bet the repeat viewings of this effort will be nonexistent. it could have been a new franchise, and a wonderful new step for imagination. another opportunity lost.",0
"seven pounds, this was the movie where i was just convinced will smith is really going for the ""i'm going to make you cry"" films. one thing i can give him a ton of credit for, the man can cry. my only thing is, as moving as the story is, will smith has proved time and time again that he can act, so why is he taking this extremely depressing story? but nevertheless it's still a good movie. i do have to admit it made me cry, but i felt that the stand out performance was rosario dawson, i absolutely love this girl, ever since i saw her in 25th hour with ed norton, i knew this girl was going to go far. she's beautiful, charming, funny and talented, can't wait to see how much further her career is going to go. but her and will smith, not so sure if they had the great chemistry that the film needed that would've made this into a great film.  two years ago tim thomas was in a car crash, which was caused by him using his mobile phone; seven people died: six strangers and his fiancée. a year after the crash, and having quit his job as an aeronautical engineer, tim donates a lung lobe to his brother, ben, an irs employee. six months later he donates part of his liver to a child services worker named holly. after that he begins searching for more candidates to receive donations. he finds george, a junior hockey coach, and donates a kidney to him, and then donates bone marrow to a young boy named nicholas. two weeks before he dies he contacts holly and asks if she knows anyone who deserves help. she suggests connie tepos, who lives with an abusive boyfriend. tim moves out of his house and into a local motel taking with him his pet box jellyfish. one night, after being beaten, connie contacts tim and he gives her the keys and deed to his beach house. she takes her two children and moves in to their new home. having stolen his brother's credentials, and making himself known by his brother's name ben, he checks out candidates for his two final donations. the first is ezra turner, a blind vegetarian meat salesman who plays the piano. tim calls ezra turner and harasses him at work to check if he is quick to anger. ezra remains calm and tim decides he is worthy. he then contacts emily posa, a self-employed greeting card printer who has a heart condition and a rare blood type. he spends time with her, weeding her garden and fixing her rare heidelberg printer. he begins to fall in love with her and decides that as her condition has worsened he needs to make his donation.  seven pounds is a good film and no doubt worth a look, i would just recommend going for the rental vs. the theater. will smith pulls in a good performance, but not his best, just most of the film required him crying in every scene, but the last one with him is a doozy. but i loved the ending, it was beautiful and really made you appreciate life and to not take it for granted. there is still good people in this world and ben's character reminds you to value life and to give to those who are in desperate need. although he went a little far, but it was still a beautiful story.  7/10",1

"well, at least my theater group did, lol. so of course i remember watching grease since i was a little girl, while it was never my favorite musical or story, it does still hold a little special place in my heart since it's still a lot of fun to watch. i heard horrible things about grease 2 and that's why i decided to never watch it, but my boyfriend said that it really wasn't all that bad and my friend agreed, so i decided to give it a shot, but i called them up and just laughed. first off the plot is totally stolen from the first one and it wasn't really clever, not to mention they just used the same characters, but with different names and actors. tell me, how did the pink ladies and t-birds continue years on after the former gangs left? not to mention the creator face motor cycle enemy, gee, what a striking resemblance to the guys in the first film as well as these t-birds were just stupid and ridiculous.  another year at rydell and the music and dancing hasn't stopped. but when a new student who is sandy's cousin comes into the scene, he is love struck by a pink lady, stephanie. but she must stick to the code where only pink ladies must stick with the t-birds, so the new student, decides to train as a t-bird to win her heart. so he dresses up as a rebel motor cycle bandit who can ride well and defeat the evil bikers from easily kicking the t-bird's butts. but will he tell stephanie who he really is or will she find out on her own? well, find out for yourself.  grease 2 is like a silly tv show of some sort that didn't work. the gang didn't click as well as the first grease did, not to mention frenchy coming back was a bit silly and unbelievable, because i thought that she graduated from rydell, but apparently she didn't. the songs were not really that catchy; i'm glad that michelle was able to bounce back so fast, but that's probably because she was the only one with talent in this silly little sequel, i wouldn't really recommend this film, other than if you are curious, but i warned you, this is just a pathetic attempt at more money from the famous musical.  2/10",0

"james j. corbett's autobiography ""the roar of the crowd"" was the starting point of this lively and well-remembered fictionalized biography. the author was heavyweight champion of the world, succeeding john l. sullivan, before the turn of the century. the events of the narrative depict corbett as a brash but likable and intelligent young man whose conquest of the world of boxing and social prejudice in his time, when he was considered merely the son of irish immigrants, a lowly bank teller and a nobody surprised everyone. it took him several hours of exciting and often amusing screen-time to prove his compeers were wrong. he is an bank teller when the film opens, but he somehow wangles an invitation to a sporting club for the well-to-do. he falls in love with a beautiful but snobbish girl, with whom he always seems to be quarreling, and he lives at home with a brawling clan of corbetts who seem to fight with one another as often as with others. when he defeats the club's best and a professional fighter borough in to embarrass him, he finally decides to become famous by fighting. he sets out on the road with his friend, who acts as manager and trainer, and despite a few near setbacks, he wins all his bouts and attracts attention. coming home to pursue his girl again, he contrives to annoy the boston strongboy, mighty john l. sullivan, who enters bars and claims he can ""lick any man in the world"". few believe he can win a bout against sullivan, but corbett, dubbed ""gentleman jim"" for his gracious manners and patrician appearance surprises everyone by moving, dancing out of range, and negating the furious sullivan's power. the film's finest scene perhaps comes when a beaten sullivan comes to congratulate corbett. the new champion rises to the moment, tells sullivan a few years before it might have been different, and shows him nothing but admiration and respect. he gets his girl as a result of his two performances, but by the end of the film, as they visit his s parents, his manager is able to tell the world, ""the corbetts are at it again"". the films is attractive and has a consistent style without being flashy. the script was written by veteran horace mccoy and vincent lawrence from the corbett novel. sidney hickox did the cinematography, with period set decorations by clarence steensen and art direction by ted smith. heinz roemheld did the music and milo anderson the gowns. the film was ably directed by action-film specialist raoul walsh. flynn also liked working with walsh but did not care for the other director he worked for most often, michael curtiz. among the cast,were ward bond as john l. sullivan, in one of his best performances lovely alexis smith a bit spotty but intelligent as the girl corbett loves and a very able errol flynn as corbett, a young man he seemed to relish playing--he later said it was his favorite role from the period...jack carson was his manager, alan hale his charismatic father, john loder a rich foe, with william frawley, minor watson, madeleine lebeau, rhys williams, arthur shields, dorothy vaughn and mike mazurki along for the enjoyable proceedings. it is hard to say enough about the logic and light-hearted fun this movie's makers have generated; it is one of the best-liked of all sports biography films, and by my standards one of the most enjoyable as well.",1
"i can appreciate what barney is trying to achieve, but after sitting through this last night at a college movie house, i couldn't help but think...when is this gonna end? a very long and ponderous two hours and fifteen minutes. i had only seen a part of cremaster 3 on dvd and thought i knew what to expect. that said, experimental films such as this are better digested in small increments. there are a couple of beautiful/horrible images...including the title sequence (no kidding), but if you go into this expecting any kind of plot or meaning, then you are in for a long, snooze-inducing ride. i managed to stay awake for the whole thing (if that's a compliment) but more often than not, i was waiting for some kind of meaning or narrative...big mistake. among the collection of images are a very ornate gift-wrapping ceremony, the creation of a disgusting dish of what appears to be petroleum jelly slabs formed with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp (this is served to the crew of the ship which is shown throughout the film), a large blubber cheesecake with a large tentacle turd placed in the center of it, and the mutual evisceration of bjork and director matthew barney which eventually culminates in some bizarre kind of communion, followed by their transformation into whale-like creatures. the soundtrack is at times beautiful and annoying...sometimes even maddening. at one time, there is a song being sung by bjork to go along with the ephemeral rituals being played before us, and at other times there is just a constant droning of a high-pitched instrument, which we see a mysterious woman playing at the beginning and end of the movie. if this sounds like it doesn't make sense, that is because is doesn't! if this sounds like your cup of tea, then you will absolutely love it! if this sounds like something that you probably won't like, then stay far away from it, because you will most likely walk out of the theater during the halfway mark like several people at the screening i attended. this is the very definition of an art film. you get from it what you take from it. but otherwise, there really isn't much there, other than a few oddities and constant construction and deconstruction rituals. i'm glad that there is a place for films such as this, but i can't say i would want to sit through it again. however, i can't say i wouldn't want to see one of barney cremaster films from start to finish and compare it with this. i think, perhaps now that i know what to expect i might enjoy something like this more. to give you an idea of what kind of comprehension factor this film has, i probably would've liked it better if i had gotten stoned. then again, it could've felt twice as long as it was, and then it would've really gotten ponderous. definitely not for everyone.",0
"what did the director think? everybody who has read the biography of artemisia is left impressed by her guts to face a public rape trial in renaissance times and even suffer torture in order to show that tassi was guilty. that fact shows the real independence and emancipation - in her most terrible hour she stands her man. why do movies depicting renaissance have to be so clinically beautiful and romantic, are we afraid to see the gritty side of life or has the hollywood happy-happy-mood won? while i would always defend a director's freedom to create his own reality in a movie i cannot make sense of turning artimisia's life story on its head. very disappointing choice by the makers of this film.",0
"this is a brilliant sci-fi movie that is very strange in how men and women both view the same film. i have talked to many people about the film and almost every guy loved it and said it was brilliant--while most women thought it was just disgusting and stupid! this is the only movie i know of that has such polarized views based on gender. perhaps many women just have a lower tolerance for disgusting or depressing plots--but whatever the cause, i have always found this difference fascinating.  the film begins with a murder and a subsequent investigation headed by charlton heston. this is set in the near future and the head of the huge international soylent corporation has been assassinated. as the film unfolds, you quickly realize this is a terrible and highly inequitable future american society. the rich live in gorgeous apartments with security and all the pleasures money can buy(including ""furniture""--a euphemism for paid mistresses that come along with the apartment). at the same time, the masses are dirt poor, unemployed and in many cases living in abandoned cars or apartment hallways. overpopulation and smog have taken a severe toll and the future looks awful indeed!   why the rich man died and the awful truth he could not live with i really should not discuss--it could ruin the film for you. however, the film has a great plot and acting and is super-exciting to watch. plus, it features edward g. robinson in his final screen performance as the crusty sidekick to heston. though not for the easily depressed or squeamish, this is a great sci-fi film that is allegorical and profound.",1
"i've rarely been as annoyed by a leading performance as i was by ali mcgraw's in this movie. god is she bothersome or what?! she says everything in the same tone and is horrible, so horrible in fact that, by contrast, ryan o'neal is brilliant.   there is not much of a story. he's rich, she's wooden, they both have to sacrifice a lot for love. his father is stonewall jackson, hers is called by his first name, in case you didn't notice the difference in the two of them that they overcame in the name of love.   the oscar nominations for this movie indicate it had to have been a bad year. john marley is fine as wooden's father, but a supporting nomination? at least ali didn't win.   i still think katharine ross should have played jennifer, but then again, if it were up to me, katharine ross would have been in a lot more movies. she's certainly a better actress than mcgraw.   i didn't even cry when she got sick, never occured to me to even feel sad.   it was nice to see tommy lee jones looking like he was about 15, and the score is good. but this one is so old by now it has a beard a mile long, and the sin of that is its not that old, but it feels it.",0
"one of the best parts of sundance is seeing movies that you would otherwise almost certainly miss. unless you're a real art-house devotee, you probably don't catch many documentaries. only a handful get any recognizable distribution. fortunately, sundance has increased its commitment to documentaries in recent years.  shakespeare behind bars is a powerful documentary about a dramatic production group at the luther luckett correctional complex in lagrange, kentucky. every year a group of inmates present a shakespearean play. director hank rogerson and his crew follow the troupe as roles are self-selected, interpreted, rehearsed and ultimately performed.  the movie is filled with fascinating revelations for those of us that have not been exposed to prison environments. despite the labels we know them by (convict, felon, murderer, etc.) we soon began to appreciate and respect these men as thinking feeling human beings. serendipitously, the play chosen for the year of filming was the tempest, with its penetrating focus on forgiveness and redemption. the actors all grapple with the relevance of the play to their lives, finding patterns and parallels with their characters and the meaning of the drama.  for a documentary film, like a book, the best that can be hoped for is that we experience something that changes our lives. shakespeare behind bars was a personal revelation for me. ""o brave new world, that has such creatures in it.""",1
"this is a film where the actors are all fine, especially brigitte bako and erik palladino, in a film where every one of the three couples meet in a situation that feels verrrrry forced to be either cute or to set the story in motion. in other words, it feels like they are contrived movie scenes, not like real life. even if women who work at peep parlors ever go out with one of their customers, it just doesn't seem realistic at all the way it is written in this film. also, when one of the characters meets the overweight woman in the film, it feels artificial, the way they look at each other seconds after arguing. again, the actors are all good, and moments of this film are nice, but overall yet another indie that could have used some rewriting before production got rolling.",0
"what? you were not aware that scooby-doo battled zombies? well, you might also not be aware of this little film that was directed by victor halperin, who had also directed white zombie four years earlier. that would probably make it the second zombie film made.  no, don't go looking for dorothy stone to expose her breasts as you would expect in most zombie films, and don't even look for any brains being eaten. this is 1936, you know.  so, what you will see is typical of the period - lots of talking.  you do get to see dean jagger (twelve o'clock high ) and bela lugosi's eyes, but that is about it. zombies in cambodia, indeed!",0
"the first of two films by johnny to, this film won many awards, but none so prestigious as a cannes golden palm nomination.  the triad elects their leader, but it is far from democratic with the behind the scenes machinations.  tony leung ka fai (zhou yu's train, ashes of time redux) is big d, who plans to take the baton no matter what it takes, even if it means a war. well, war is not going to happen as that is bad for business. big d will change his tune or...  good performances by simon yam, louis koo and ka tung lam (infernal affairs i & iii), along with tony leung ka fai.  whether masons, made men in the mafia, or members of the wo sing society, the ceremonies are the same; fascinating to watch.  to be continued...",1
"given the low budget and production limitations, this movie is very good. it is plausible, realistic, and shows how the csikos (hungarian horsemen who lived on the plains (puszta) risked their lives to save a downed american pilot from the ruthless and savage nazis. we are drawn into strong feelings for the young, impressionable, yet highly courageous boy--who admires the american pilot. if you're looking for special effects, superman heroes, and magical endings--this movie is not for you. if you want to feel what it must have been like to dodge the persistent, amoral nazis and their lack of compassion, then you will be enthralled by this movie. i truly enjoyed it and for those who love horses, dogs, and humble, helpful people who value freedom and those who aspire to that end, this movie will be one you'll remember for a long time.",1
"while channel surfing, we found this movie with its promising synopsis. we were dismayed at the flat acting, and formulaic storyline. we found amusing the exploding car scenes, unbelievable shoot outs, and sets that crash down with the weight of tyro-foam and cardboard. what was even more hilarious was seeing all the recycled scenes from ""dante's peak"", where the church front falls on the school bus, the store fronts break away from the main street, the overpass collapsing, and the red truck speeding down the alley way as the bricks fall down on it. it was a good laugh although unintended, and leaves the viewer wondering if it was not originally intended as a low budget spoof of disaster films.",0
"seldom do we see such short comments written by imdb filmgoers. perhaps it's because this lightweight dark comedy entertains and pleases without depth, or are we missing something? i'd watch it again if i had some incentive.  so what's a happenstance? to the french it is ""le battement d'ailes du papillon"" serendipity? fate? perhaps it's an event that is the culmination of a series of random happenings. we've all had these (it's called life) but when looked at in this way, you begin to get the feeling that ""random"" might be more like ""fated.""  a 'happenstance' in this film might be an occurrence as minor as knocking a few leaves of lettuce off the back of a truck or as major as basing a major life decision on the accuracy of a stranger tossing of a pebble. all these incidents cause other events that ... well you get the picture? dominoes. multiply those by 30 characters and an average of 6 each and you have to really stretch your imagination to accept the remote chance that this scenario could happen. and i think that there's a diagnosis for those who believe that life is like this. but then this is the magic world of cinema.  we admit that it is fun to watch the way the writer/director weaves together these unrelated events into a story which enmeshes the lives of these french citizens. if you have a couple of hours and are looking for a whimsical escape, here's the place to do it. or if you're recovering from surgery and aren't going anywhere anyway, this will engage you while your stitches are healing.   ""happenstance"" will not go down as an award winner but it should develop a cult following. stranger things have happened.   soren kierkegaard is attributed with the following: ""life can only be understood backwards; but it must be lived forward."" if you looked at the detail in many of your own life experiences (meeting your first love, finding the perfect gift, your last auto accident) you would find a series of seemingly random events leading up to it.  that's the answer! i forgot to bring along an existentialist to explain ""happenstance"" to me.",1
"this movie is obviously low-budget & filmed in british columbia,canada. the obstacles that had to be overcome to make this movie convincing(set in california & late 60's-80's)were well conceived.i believe this is the best & most accurate version of the zodiac killings that plagued the town of vallejo & the bay area from 1968-19? (he was never caught).edward james olmos(det. dave toschi) & george dzundza(zodiac-at the time believed to be arthur leigh allen, since cleared by dna & fingerprints)play a game of cat & mouse re-visiting crime scenes together, each one trying to trigger the other into an emotional revelation.olmos dying from some type of terminal disease & knowing dzundza did it,still totally obsessed to the point of losing his family & becoming a full blown alcoholic along the way.dzundza totally oblivious & self absorbed(like all serial killers) to the carnage left in his wake.the only disappointment was the""over the top"" ending otherwise pretty accurate.if you tire of the typical hollywood fluff or have an interest in the zodiac case,check it out.",1
"a struggling actor finds the best way to break into hollywood is to start knocking off the competition. but what makes break a leg a real gem is the sardonic look into the existence of the struggling (and not so) la actor. it brings us into that world with effortless irony and wit. it's also got a polished look and very adept direction under monika mitchell. break a leg is one of those rare independent films that doesn't compromise its production values at any level. the writing is tight, the dialogue first rate. cassini is an actor's actor, and the role really shows off his talents. the climactic scene between him and rene garcia is an instant classic, and may go down as one of the funniest hollywood scenes of all time. i saw it at an advanced screening, and everyone in the audience laughed uncontrollably and raved about it afterwards.",1
"this movie is just plain dumb.  from the casting of ralph meeker as mike hammer to the fatuous climax, the film is an exercise in wooden predictability.  mike hammer is one of detective fiction's true sociopaths. unlike marlow and spade, who put pieces together to solve the mystery, hammer breaks things apart to get to the truth. this film turns hammer into a boob by surrounding him with bad guys who are ... well, too dumb to get away with anything. one is so poorly drawn that he succumbs to a popcorn attack.  other parts of the movie are right out of the three stooges play book. velda's dance at the barre, for instance, or the bad guy who accidentally stabs his boss in the back. and the continuity breaks are shameful: frau blucher is running down the centerline of the road when the camera is tight on her lower legs but she's way over the side when the camera pulls back for a wider shot. the worst break, however, precedes the popcorn attack. the bad guy stalking hammer passes a clock seconds after our hero, except the clock shows he was seven minutes behind our guy.  to be fair, there were some interesting camera angles and lighting, and the grand finale is so bad that it must been seen, which is the only reason that it gets two points out of 10.",0
"oh god, what a horrible, horrible film. meant to be a comment on the state of society, it's just a reflection of the worst of the worst in reality tv. interstitials hosted by jason jones and don mckellar are the most obnoxious part, written in a tone that is perhaps meant to be reflexive and insightful. rather, these moments are mind numbing as they speak to the camera with dialogue written by someone with a love for insulting, condescending speech that shoves the ""meaning"" of the film down the viewer's throat.  also, a point to would-be filmmakers: long takes and quiet scenes do not equal art. neither do extreme angles or logic stretched to the point of absurdity.  if anyone out there is interested in watching this film, please don't. seriously. please. you have better things to do.",0
"this ludicrous and inept film is certainly the most misguided version of ""hamlet"" to ever reach the screen. branagh's approach to the material can only be described as vulgar; going to such lengths as depicting ophelia in a straight jacket, having fortinbras' army appear suddenly on the horizon (looking very much like the climax of ""monty python and the holy grail"") when the palace is apparently guarded only by francisco (who shouts the very un-shakespearean cry of ""ataaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack"" before being gunned down), and multitudes of star cameos that harken back to the days of jimmy cagney's bottom and mary pickford's kate.  branagh chose to set his film in an edwardian setting but at the same time decided to employ an almost uncut text, so that frequently the dialogue that is firmly rooted in elizabethan mentality makes no sense in the context that it is being performed. and branagh does not concern himself with such textural subtleties as the ambiguous nature of hamlet and olphelia's relationship, treating the audience to a vulgar nude sex scene between the couple that tosses any ambiguity right out the stained glass window.  the uncut text does allow branagh to indulge in his favorite cinematic pastime: more footage of kenneth branagh. this is never so apparent as in the ""how all occasions inform against me"" speech that ends the first half of the nineteen hour film (at least that's how it feels), which attempts to play to a dramatic crescendo along the lines of gone with the wind's ""i'll never be hungry again."" this may serve branagh's ego, but it does not serve shakespeare or the speech: when i saw the film in the theater, i leaned over to my companion and snickered ""great moments with mr. hamlet."" branagh saves the funniest and most tasteless moment for last, when he attempts to out-do the olivier film and its justly celebrated death of claudius by having hamlet jump from off a high tower onto the monarch, impaling him with a sword. branagh's dane does in the king by heroically throwing an apparently magic rapier from across the palace to run through claudius' heart with a super hero's bulls eye. the only thing that saved the moment from being unbearably maddening was that it was so off-the-wall funny.  while this film has been praised in some quarters as a serious depiction of the tragedy, it is in fact nothing but a star-studded display of a once-talented filmmaker being overtaken by his own narcissism. the emperor has no clothes, and this hamlet has nothing to offer but a few unintended laughs and the appalling sight of one man's ego out of control.",0
"i've been scolded and scorned by fellow christians for stating my disappointment with this movie. i get hounded by statements like these: ""i can't believe you didn't like it! it was made totally by christians!"" ""everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie! it was made by a church and not hollywood. we should spend our money on movies like this! they only used $100,000 to make the film."" ""this is by a real church and christian school in georgia! a preacher wrote and directed it."" so, apparently, the reason i should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is was made by christians. that is all that is needed for me to love the movie.  look, i got the movie without knowing anything about the background of the film. i had never heard of it and had no idea - other than football - what it was about. i watched it like i watch any other movie and was disappointed. i was disappointed in the lousy editing and lame script. i was very disappointed on the resolution after the climax. don't worry. there have been other cheap movies and other expensively made movies that have earned less respect from me. it isn't about the making of the movie. it is the end product.  the writer acknowledges that god doesn't say ""yes"" to everything we pray for in the way we want, but he wanted to show by having faith, god changes our lives. that is true. however, god can change our lives and we're still infertile. god can change our lives and we don't get a raise from our job. god can change our lives and our car is still an old jalopy. god can change our lives and our house is still stinky. why didn't he portray that in the movie? others voiced their concern to the writer/director over the matter, but apparently, he was defensive.  i did not think the acting was horrible nor many of the landscape shots. i like the idea of going to god and recognizing his awesome power and our weakness.  the writing and directing were very weak. it is easy to distinguish this because many of the characters have no development. all we really get from the coach's wife is she is not pregnant (well, until the end of the movie). it seems as if there was only ball player that had the potential to have an interesting character and that was chopped to bits into ""i have a cripple father and i can't play football well, but i'll kick the winning field goal even though i've never kicked a real field goal before."" another problem was the christian school itself. umm, i have worked for two christian schools, went to one myself, and have had many nieces and nephews in other christian schools. all in all, i've had some pretty close connections with about ten different ones. none of the problems that i have seen in all of these schools were addressed. i saw this as totally surreal in the movie about their school and wished they had shown the human factor. it would have been nice to see a dose of reality and how god can work.  i will close by stating that every work - either written or drawn or played on an instrument - shares the artist's world view. the world view that was shown to me in this movie consists of ""people who pray the right way win ball games, get new cars, conceive when they couldn't, get a raise, and get their house fixed - all within a short time span."" i know. i should love the movie simply due to the sincerity of the people who made it. i think i should love the movie because it was well done and for no other reason.",0
"this is not a good movie but i still like it. the cat clovis is gold in a jar as well as the premise of the cats themselves - intrinsically opposed to the evil sleepwalkers. i think there is more to this movie than people realize, basically it is very harsh, but this brusqueness can sometimes be good. it's got the corny lines, the abrupt ending and a comedic element conveyed by the bumbling policemen.   did anyone find the incestuous element a bit disturbing? ultimately this movie is casually and randomly acrimonious, which is quite effective, i liken it to psycho - the relationship between the mother and son, the changing of protagonists. i think the abruptness works also, this is not a movie that you want them to lengthen, it only works if it's short.  i'm still not sure whether the director lacked depth, or whether he did these things with purpose, we know stephen king has ability, yet i haven't even read his books, only seen some of his movies.  anyway, i liked it. if you like harsh corny movies with 80's overtones just watch it. but don't expect too much. it really is so bad its good.",1
"this is a great british film. a cleverly observed script with many quotable lines, which captures perfectly what magic mushrooms can do to a man over a weekend. as per usual phil daniels is excellent along with that most under rated of british actors geoff bell. peter bowles with a joint hanging out of his mouth is a casting masterstroke and gary stretch with his brooding looks brings something strangely atmospheric to the piece. although it seems to be billed as a biker movie, i think it will find an audience outside of this, purely on the premise that a lot of people have been there done it and got the t-shirt. also a great original soundtrack with a blinding version of freebird. this really could be a 21st century heir to the famous ealing comedies. like the weed in the welsh fields: it's a grower!",1
"in northeastern of brazil, the father of the twelve years old illiterate maria (fernanda carvalho) sells his daughter to the middle man of a prostitution organization, tadeu (chico dias), to be employed as a housemaid and have a better life. however, the girl is resold to the farmer lourenço (otávio augusto) that deflowers her, and he gives the abused girl to his teenager son to have his first sexual experience. then she is sent to a brothel in a gold field in amazonas and explored his owner, the despicable saraiva (antonio calloni). when maria escapes to rio de janeiro expecting a better life, she is explored by the cáften vera (darlene glória).  ""anjos do sol"" exposes the sad and shameful reality of child prostitution in brazil through the fate of the girl maria. last year i saw ""lilja 4-ever"" that tells an identical story in the former soviet union; therefore this problem does exist in third world countries. director and writer rudi lagemann presents a great movie exposing the reality but never showing nudity or explicit sexual scenes. it is the debut of the promising fernanda carvalho, who has an excellent performance in the role of a scared child fighting for survival. most of the prostitutes are amateurs, and it is impossible to recognize the famous darlene glória so different she is after many plastic surgeries. the bitter and hopeless end of the story is also very realistic. my vote is ten.  title (brazil): ""anjos do sol"" (""angels of the sun"")",1
"i enjoyed the film and would suggest to anyone just out for a good time. don't take the film all too seriously because remember it's disney and it's rated g. it's good clean fun although some parts may be recognised by adults but children would never notice, particularly the ""triangle"" between cruella, le pelt, and cruella's faithful valet alonso. glenn close is fantastic and really has made cruella her own and is believably terrifying even when she is ""cured"" of her fur loving ways, she can instill fear in the audience with her shrills that literally shake the theater. (i even found myself jumping in my seat when she catches you by surprise with her 'bipolarity' as the dog loving ella.) all in all i will go see it again in theaters, i found myself enjoying it so much.",1
"this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for steve carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. catherine keener was terrific as trish, and all of steve carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended.",1
"with lots of sunshine, gauzy light and shadow filtering through windows and into rooms, tracking shots moving through crowds with hand-held camera, quick-paced editing and extreme close-ups here and there, the photography is the thing in this interesting, artistically done film.  the plot of this film starts out as a bit of fluff about a beauty contest. the film begins on a warm sunday at the local swimming pool, where we meet the lovely lucienne aka lulu (played by louise brooks) - a bit of a show-off in front of the gawking men by poolside, she soon decides to enter herself to represent france in the miss europe beauty contest, much to the chagrin of her very jealous, stick-in-the-mud fiancé (a pretty annoying fellow, really). strutting down the runway the ten contestants display themselves in swimsuits, while the winner is chosen as the contestant who receives the longest applause (i was wondering, couldn't the girls just walk slower to prolong their length of time - and thus applause - on the catwalk?!). lulu is soon being chased by a prince and a maharaja, but her hot-headed beau doesn't like the attentions paid to her by other men or her adoring public, for that matter (i guess he just wants her in his house, cooking his meals, and staying out of sight, eh?!).  louise brooks is beautiful and charming, her presence helps enhance this film, but it's really the way it is photographed that held my interest the most. a bit distracting is the odd dubbed sound, which is a bit off. the print on this version looked very clear and full of nice contrast though. watching this i just tried to overlook the sound problems and watch the film visually, and i found the movie to be excellent, well worth seeing.",1
i have seen the short movie a few years ago. after that i watch all sequels. the first one is really not the best - but it's the most popular one. i've already watch the making of guinea pig 1. it's really great what these guys did. also the sequels are excellent in the special effects. take your chance to watch it!,1
"this movie is basically about some girls in a catholic school that end up getting into trouble because of putting red dye in one in one of their school mates shampoo and after being reprimanded for this act they decide to take off to florida for a vacation. on their way there they meet up with some guys in a local diner and decide that they would both meet up with each other in another location later on. the girls end up on a road side near the woods and stop for awhile and while one of the girls decides to walk around a bit she sees a murder happen in which the local sheriff himself is involved. she becomes scared and runs to tell the others what happened. the other girls decide to go take a look with her and two of them get killed by the killer. then the two remaining girls are caught by the killer and are placed in local jail cell. the deputy sheriff meanwhile is keeping watch over the girls and despite their insistence that the sheriff is the killer he ignores them both and acts as ignorant and everybody else in this movie who just can't put two and two together much less some lousy detective work at that. the best part was the rape scene between the killer and one of the girls where he decides to rape her in her jail cell and it seems that the girl actually wants to be raped by this man and the bare chest scene i admit was good but before their lips meet he has other things in mind. this movie reminds me of the low-budget thriller ""blood song"" with frankie avalon staring in it, the same motive just a different character part. it's not a movie worth renting not even for an 80's low-budget movie and the ending was the worst ending i have ever seen in a movie and it left me wanting my money back!",0
"students often ask me why i choose this version of othello. shakespeare's text is strongly truncated and the film contains material which earned it an ""r"" rating.  i have several reasons for using this production: first, i had not seen a depiction of the moor that actually made me sympathetic to othello until i saw fishburne play him. i saw james earl jones and christopher plummer play othello and iago on broadway, and it was wonderful. plummer's energy was especially noticeable. but in spite of jone's incredible presence both physically and vocally, the character he played just seemed too passive to illicit from me a complete emotional purgation in the aristotelian sense. jones, in fact, affirmed what i felt when in an interview he noted that he had played othello as passive--seeing iago as basically doing him over. unfortunately this sapped my grief for the character destruction. thus, i felt sympathy for jone's moor but not the horror over his corruption by an evil man. in contrast, fishburne's othello is a strong and vigorous figure familiar with taking action. thus, iago's temptation to actively deal with what is presented to othello as his wife's unfaithfulness is a perversion of the general's positive quality to be active not passive.1 the horror of the story is that this good quality in othello becomes perverted. fishburne's depiction is therefore classically tragic.  second, fishburne is the first black actor to play othello in a film. both orsen wells and anthony hopkins did fine film versions, but they were white men in black face.2 why is this important? why should a black actor be the black man on the stage?3 certainly in shakespeare's day they used black face just as they used boys to make girls. perhaps then, the reason is the same. female actors bring a special quality to female roles on the shakespearian stage because they understand best what shakespeare's genius was trying to present. a gifted black actor should play the moor because his experience in a white dominated culture is vital to understanding what shakespeare's genius recognized: the pain of being marginalized because of race. an important theme in othello is isolation caused by racism. although it is a mistake to insert american racism into a shakespearian play, there can be little doubt that racism is still working among the characters. many, including desdimona's father, think that a union between a venetian white christian woman and a north african black christian man is unnatural.  third, shakespeare was never g rated. he never has been. his stage productions were always typified by violence and strong language. but shakespeare's genius uses these elements not as sensationialism but for artistic honesty.",1
"""sky captain"" may be considered an homage to comic books, pulp adventures and movie serials but it contains little of the magic of some of the best from those genres. one contributor says that enjoyment of the film depends on whether or not one recognizes the films influences. i don't think this is at all true. one's expectations of the films,fiction and serials that ""captain"" pays tribute to were entirely different. especially so for those who experienced those entertainments when they were children. this film is almost completely devoid of the charm and magnetic attraction of those. of course we know the leads will get into and out of scrapes but there has to be some tension and drama. toward the climax of ""captain"" law and paltrow have ten minutes to prevent catastrophe and by the time they get down to five minutes they are walking not running toward their goal. they take time out for long looks and unnecessary conversation and the contemplation of a fallen foe with 30 seconds left to tragedy. of course one expects certain conventions to be included but a good director would have kept up some sense of urgency.  one doesn't expect films like this to necessarily ""make sense"". one does expect them to be fun, thrilling and to have some sense of interior logic. ""captain"" has almost none. remember when law and paltrow are being pursued by the winged creatures and they reach a huge chasm which they cross via a log bridge? well how come they are perfectly safe from those creatures when they reach the other side? they can fly!!! the chasm itself means nothing to them. the bridge is unnecessary for them so where is the escape? if the land across the chasm is 'forbidden' to the flying creatures the film made no effort to let us know how or why or even if.  i know that paltrow and law (both of whom have given fine performances in the past) were playing ""types"" but both were pretty flat. only giovanni ribisi (who showed himself capable of great nuance here) and angelina jolie seemed to give any ""oomph"" to their roles although omid djalili seemed like he could have handled a little more if he'd only been given the chance. he did a pretty good job anyway considering how he was basically wasted.  the film had a great 'look' but there are so many ways in which cgi distracts. cgi works best when it is used for the fantastical, when it is used to create creatures who don't exist in nature or for scientific or magical spectacular. when it is used to substitute for natural locations it disappoints. there is no real sense of wonder. a cgi mountain doesn't have any of the stateliness or sense of awe and foreboding that a real mountain does. i know that the design of this film was quite deliberate and it wasn't necessarily supposed to look real but shouldn't it feel that way? it just didn't.   as for the weak and clichéd script...homage is no excuse. even so, had the movie had some thrills and dramatic tension it might still have been enjoyable. ""the last samurai"" was as predictable as the days of the week and i am no fan of tom cruise but it had everything that ""captain"" didn't most notably it drew the viewer into its world and made us accept its rules and way of being in a way that ""sky captain"" most definitely did not.  i'd like to see a similar approach taken for films about comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's. the original (jay garrick) flash or green lantern (alan scott) come to mind as being ripe for such treatment. maybe the better, more well known and fully realized characters that those character are would make for a much better film. it would be hard to be worse.",0
"what a complete waste of time. the movie starts as a clone of the saw series, but with even worse acting. melissa joan hart is absolutely horrible. the ending is ridiculous and the story contains no twists, not plot surprises and just a plain bad ending. i liked some of the characters and i was hoping for everything to be tied together at the end. it just doesn't happen. it's a total ""wrestler"" ending with none of the good acting. i can't believe i spent the time watching this. it's not ""fun"" as some people put it. a guy in a mask kidnaps people who are connected and forces them to figure it out. the connection is a stretch and he should have shot the main actress first.",0
"is it a remake og the thing (1982/1951), i think it is, there are so many factors from det previous movies do deny it.  so the acting is bad, james spader does a superlow stargate re-enactment of himself, with his coffy mug and his somwhat strange thinking/movements but that's about it, the other actors i did't even notise. you don't get the feeling of getting to know anyone of the main characters. and the plot evolvement is slow, boring and, yah i know what is about to happend in 30mins. score/music is ultraboring, imean there are alot of ubertallented people out there that would make scores for a coke and a credit, but this is major crap. some of the special effects are nice, if it was made in early 90's. if you like slimy aliens, chills and thrills, don't whatch this movie. its a dull combination of the thing, alien 3, outbreak and some jerry bruckheimer/michael bay production gone really really bad. now this combination would be cool if somone knew what they where doing, and the only ones on this production that knew that was, no one.  though i have seen far worse, i would not recomend this movie to anyone, but if you are up one cold night, and just wanna glanse at something, it will pass the time, slowly.",0
"the fact that someone actually spent money on such a bad script, is beyond me. this really must be one of the worst films, in addition to ""haunted highway"" i have ever seen. bad actors, and a really bad story. there's no normal reactions to any event in this film, and even though it's halloween , normal people would have bigger reactions when they're witnessing their father being killed, not to mention gutted, people with tape covering their airways, not being able to breathe (in a room with at least 50 people i might add) and some person dressed up as satan dragging dead people out of his house, even an 8 year old would see the difference between a doll and a person. not to mention the fact that no one could possibly be that naive and dumb to believe the reality of satan and jesus' appearances on the same day, like this kid does. when i was 8, i sure had more brains than that.   but, the really stupid thing is that everyone else seems to be falling for this mute satan look-alike as well, no questions asked. the question throughout the film is, is it really satan, or is it some crazy person killing people off whenever he feels like it? well, he's got human hands, arms, built and whatever, so i guess he's supposed to be in the movie as well, otherwise they did a lousy job concealing it. then, with this person being human and all, he was able to kill an old lady, a man and his mistress, 5 (!!???) cops (all with guns and training i presume), and a few other people.....and obviously everyone was just standing there waiting for him, or what?  the whole concept and way of telling the story is absolutely the worst thing i've seen, and i would never recommend anyone to waste 1 hour and 30 minutes of their lives to watch this total crap.",0
"the second renaissance, part 1 let's us show how the machines first revolted against the humans. it all starts of with a single case, in which the machines claim that they have a right to live as well, while the humans state a robot is something they own and therefore can do anything with they want.  although an interesting premise, the story gets really silly from then on with (violent!) riots between the robots and mankind. somehow it doesn't seem right, as another reviewer points it, it's all a little too clever.  the animatrix stories that stay close to the core of the matrix (in particular osiris) work for the best. as for second renaissance part 1, i'd say it's too violent and too silly. 4/10.",0
"anthony mcgarten has adapted his play, via satellite, and directed the best comedic film to come out of new zealand for a long time. chrissy dunn (danielle cormack) is a drop-out. she hasn't achieved much in her latter years and has grown resentful of her family since her father's deathbed confession. her twin sister, carol (also portrayed by danielle cormack) is basking in the media limelight as she represents new zealand in swimming at the olympics. a middle-aged, desireless and desperate director (brian sergent) and his good-natured cameraman - who is also chrissy's one-night stand from the night previous - paul (karl urban) film the dunn family's proudest moment; watching carol swim to victory. this wouldn't be so bad but chrissy's family is the epitome of embarrassing. first of all there is the matriach of the wellingtonian dunns, joyce (donna akerston). she makes fairy cakes and cocktail sausages for the all-important film crew and refuses to change the way she is. her oldest daughter, jen (rima te wiata) is desperate to be something more than common. she has a nice home (with bedroom walls painted ""blackberry sorbet""), expensive tastes and a nasty parasitic attitude to match. she is also nearing 40 and desparate for a child. her husband, ken (tim balme) is an electrician and forces himself on jobs that don't need doing...as well as doing jobs that need to be done, ie jen. the middle daughter, lyn (jodie dorday - who won best supporting actress at new zealand film awards for this portrayal)is a ""knocked-up"" tart who has a dubious history with ken. both older sisters clash, the mother is in a state, ken is as bad a tooltime tim taylor, carol is fuelling her olympic desire and chrissy is aware all of this is to be splashed on national tv - why shouldn't she be embarrassed? it is great to see some famous new zealand faces perform in the suburban comedy that has witty lines to spare. i loved the sparring between jen and lyn. one is like an adult mona-my-biological-clock-is-ticking-away, the other a narcisstic tramp who has what her sister desires - a bun in the oven. climax of the film is quite sentimental and is nicely done. the performances are a treat and the film works perfectly. a great way to spend an hour-and-a-half.

"the central theme in this movie seems to be confusion, as the relationships, setting, acting and social context all lead to the same place: confusion. even harvey keitel appears to be out of his element, and lacks his usual impeccable clarity, direction and intensity. to make matters worse, his character's name is 'che', and we are only told (directly, by the narrator) well into the film that he is not 'that' che, just a guy named che. the family relationships remain unclear until the end of the film, and once defined, the family is divided - the younger generation off to america. so cliché. other reviews discuss how the movie depicts the impact of the revolution on a boy's family; however the political stance of the director is murky at best, and we are never quite sure who is responsible for what bloodshed. so they lost their property (acquired by gambling profits) - so what? refusing to take a political stand, when making a movie about the cuban revolution, is an odd and cowardly choice. not to mention the movie was in english! why are all these cubans speaking english? no wonder they did not get permission to film in cuba. and if family life is most important to look at here, it would be great if we could figure out who is who - we are 'introduced' to them all in the beginning - a cheap way out of making the relationships clear throughout the film! the acting was mostly shallow, wooden, and unbelievable, timing was off all around. the 'special' visual effects were confusing and distracting. references to american films - and the black character as greek chorus - strictly gratuitous, intellectually ostentatious, and consistently out of place. i only watched the whole movie because i was waiting for clarity, or some point to it all. it never happened.",0
"what exactly was going on during world war 11 in new zealand when american forces were there?  this awful story of 4 sisters was really pathetic to view. can you imagine casting joan fontaine as the older sister to sandra dee? fontaine looked more like her mother. even funnier was that fontaine becomes pregnant in the film.  piper laurie and paul newman who showed such great on screen chemistry 4 years later in ""the hustler,"" have no scenes together in this film. laurie plays another sister who goes off to wellington to tramp around there, despite the fact that she is married. woe to her when her husband comes back from the war.  jean simmons is widowed and finds romance with a much subdued paul newman. there is even romance for the young miss dee here.  the picture has little to no meaning. are they trying to say that all is fair in love and war? if they are, they did a poor job in selling this.  the conflict of interest with newman and simmons is quickly disposed of. that is what should have been quickly done to this terribly disappointing film of 1957.",0

"some gorehound-friends recommended ""live feed"" to me, and basically i can't really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze, but it is of course not a very good film. more than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema, the so-called torture porn, ryan nicholson tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre (and that includes the role models ""hostel"" and ""saw"") with its sick & twisted make-up effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked co-eds tried up, suffering and begging for their lives. there's no actual plot to describe. five utterly brainless twenty-something friends take a trip to asia. one of them has asian roots, but other than that i don't really know why they opted to travel there instead of to cancun. they're clearly not interested in the continents culture and even cause a hectic scene when they witness a local butchering a cute puppy dog on the market. the quintet subsequently dives into the lurid night life and one of them accidentally insults the leader of a criminal clan. a simply apology clearly doesn't suffice, as the gangster follow them into an adult theater and gradually subject all of them to vicious torture. one girl has her breast impaled and another poor wench even has a poisonous snake shoved down her throat; yikes. ""live feed"" is surprisingly boring despite of all the bloodshed and the amateurish production values are quite difficult to overlook, even if you're used to watching independent fan-boy trash cinema like this. the fat bloke depicted on the cover, an oriental s&m executioner, is admittedly quite cool and he's also the most talented of the whole bunch, because he at least keeps his mouth shut the entire time. i wouldn't exactly recommend this pile of filth, but hey, if you like loud & hideous metal music, nauseating torture footage and dim-witted losers, go right ahead and watch!",0

"the ""movie aimed at adults"" is a rare thing these days, but moonstruck does it well, and is still a better than average movie, which is aging very well. although it's comic moments aim lower than the rest of it, the movie has a wonderful specificity (italians in brooklyn) that isn't used to shortchange the characters or the viewers. (i.e. mobsters never appear in acomplication. it never becomes grotesque like my big fat greek wedding) the secondary story lines are economically told with short scenes that allow a break from the major thread. these are the scenes that are now missing in contemporary movies where their immediate value cannot be impressed upon producers and bigwigs. i miss these scenes. it also beautifully involves older characters. the movie takes it's own slight, quiet path to a conclusion. there isn't a poorly written scene included anywhere to make some executives sphincter relax. cage and cher do very nice work.  moonstruck invokes old-school, ethnic, workaday new york much like 'marty' except moonstruck is way less sanctimonious.",1

"i recently saw the broadway revival of ""blithe spirit"" starring angela lansbury, rupert everett, christine ebersole, and jayne atkinson. it's a terrific production, and shows what good actors can do with a play that is less than perfect. angela lansbury is extremely funny as madame arcati.  it was probably a mistake, then, to check out the film version of the play starring rex harrison. the movie does not have the energy or the laughs of a good stage production.  ""blithe spirit"" is probably one of those plays that works better with a live cast, in an audience full of people who have come to laugh. the actors can improvise, give touches and nuances to their performance and delivery of the lines, and involve the audience on a personal level that you can't get in a movie house, or with a dvd showing, where the audience is separated from the story by the ""fourth wall."" the story: charles condomine (rex harrison), a successful writer, lives with his wife ruth (constance cummings) in a house in the english countryside. seeking information for his next book, a book dealing with the supernatural, charles invites madame arcati (margaret rutherford, reprising her role from the original 1941 london production), a local spiritual medium, over to his house to conduct a séance. charles believes that spiritism is a sham, but hopes to pick up ""the tricks of the trade."" but then madame arcati brings back the ghost of elvira (kaye hammond), charles's first wife, who died of pneumonia seven years ago. elvira refuses to leave, and develops a spitting rivalry with ruth over charles (complicated by the fact that only charles can see or hear elvira).  on stage, the actors can give performances that invite laughs in this situation. but on the screen, the actors in ""blithe spirit"" tear through the lines as if they don't know that anyone is listening to them. they mumble lines that were designed to get laughs on the stage. the performances by harrison, cummings, and even kaye hammond are flat and lifeless. only margaret rutherford seems to have retained her spark and humor as madame arcati.  the oscar-winning visual effects in the film are unimpressive -- not just by today's standards, but by the standards of 1946! they consist mostly of kaye hammond walking around in fluorescent green outfits and makeup, being photographed in special lighting to make her look like a glowing ghost.  the cinematographer deserves some credit for creative lighting. but compare the dull visual effects of ""blithe spirit"" to the truly groundbreaking effects in disney's ""song of the south"" -- which was eligible for awards the same year. in ""south,"" humans and animated characters share the screen seamlessly for minutes at a time. compared to ""south,"" the oscar that ""blithe spirit"" received for special effects was completely undeserved.  at any rate, i can only encourage you to catch the broadway revival of this play with angela lansbury before it closes. as for the movie with rex harrison, skip it.",0
"okay, as a long time disney fan, i really -hate- direct-to-video disney sequels. walt himself didn't believe in them. he believed in ""and they lived happily ever after"" being the end of it. but this one...really ticked the taco. there were so many ripoffs of other disney films in this, it wasn't funny. quick summary, if you don't already know...: melody, the daughter of ariel and prince eric, is born. ursula's sister, morganna (who basically looks like ursula, if she were to dye herself green and go on the ally macbeal starvation diet) shows up and, after trying to do the newborn tyke in, and failing, prophesizes doom for the characters. after that ordeal, ariel goes into a lapse of being like her father, and refuses to tell melody about her mermaid heritage, and later on, forbids her to go near the sea. well surprise surprise. melody finds out, being the stubborn brat she is, and runs away, then makes a deal with morgana to become a mermaid, in exchange for something. (gee does that sound familiar?) she becomes one, but in her half of the bargain, has to retrieve her granddaddy's trident and bring it back to the sea witch. while doing this, she runs into a couple of outcast animals, a penguin and a walrus named timon and pumb--huh? wait...no! that's not timon and pumbaa! or is it? could of fooled me. anyway, i'd like to reveal more, but pretty much anything that could be guessed to happen does. ok so...long story short. this movie ""borrows"" too much from other (better) disney films...and does it horribly. come on...tip and dash? why not just make dash obscenely flatulent and make it an even more obvious ripoff! ugh. not to mention, the total character butchery of ariel's persona. she's gone from being a freespirited, headstrong woman, to a clone of her father. not good at all...they're basically telling us the sweet, firey little mermaid we've known to grow and love is dead. plus melody herself isn't such a great character either...she's damned annoying! and bratty! not to mention what they've done to flounder. ugh...anyway if you decide to see this piece of created-mainly-for-profit-reasons, no-imagination, eisner-sponsored c******t, i suggest maybe waiting 'till its on the disney channel or some other tv station. because, it's not even worth the price of a rental.   * out of ***** stars.",0

"a toothsome little potboiler whose 65-minute length doesn't seem a second too short, my name is julia ross harks back to an english tradition of things not being what they seem -- hitchcock's the lady vanishes is one example. out-of-work julia ross (nina foch) finds a dream job at a new employment agency in london, whose sinister representative seems very anxious to ascertain if she has living relatives or a boyfriend. after reporting to duty, she wakes up (having been drugged) in a vast manderley-like pile on the cornish coast, supposedly as the barmy-in-the-crumpet wife of george macready, who displays an alarming interest in knives and ice picks. his doting, enabling mum is the irresistible dame may whitty (this time a model of bustling efficiency on the other side of good-vs-evil than she occupied in the lady vanishes). the nightmare vision of this tale unfolds claustrophobically; we know what's going on but are powerless to tell poor julia. this movie, curiously, is regularly accorded a place of honor as one of the earliest (and very few british) films noirs. i think it's closer to the gothic old-dark-house tradition than the american one of wet cobblestones and urban corruption; it does, however, evince a more modern, psychoanalytic cast of mind. whatever you call it, it remains a sharply satisfying thriller.",1

"i did no research on the film prior to my first viewing of it because it was part of a welles box set i had recently purchased. a box set i chiefly got because i wanted to own a man for all seasons and to also re-evaluate waterloo. so i stick orson and rita in the player and i'm treated to class and confusion in equal measure.  on the surface the story seemed a simple one, man meets gorgeous woman and saves her from a couple of thugs, they click straight away and man gets offer of work on a cruise with woman and her famous lawyer husband, and then.............  ..well it becomes murder mystery of plotted devilment and much shenanigans. michael o'hara (orson welles} himself doesn't really know what is going on, he is as confused as the viewer is, and that is wonderful to watch as he is pulled all over the place by pretty much everyone in the film. obviously being pulled by the heart strings by a femme fatale of such beauty as elsa bannister (rita hayworth} has its moments, but you just know that things are going to go pear shaped.  so many wonderful things in the film, it has welles visual style all over it, see a scene in an aquarium that is marvellous and the ending sequences in a fun house is majestic on the eye. the narration from o'hara is joyously self mocking, and we get good light relief by way of a court case with everett sloane considerably lighting up proceedings.  yet the film is an oddity, and in fact it's a choppy viewing experience, because {as i was to find out after} studio bosses cut the film by pretty much a whole hour, and that is just not only frustrating to us the viewer, but unfair on welles' vision. i'm positive that a full original cut of this film would have been lauded and revered wholesale, as it is tho, we have a very good and intriguing film, one that sadly only hints at greatness, but remains a fiendishly engrossing film that i'm glad i own to revisit further. 8.5/10",1

"julia stiles is a talented young actress, who with guidance from a reputable agent has a lot of potential. obviously, the person who guided her into this travesty is not someone who cares anything about her career. i sat in the theater surrounded by teenagers who left in droves to find another movie to sneak into wondering who thought this movie would appeal to anyone. it was poorly written, the casting director could only have put 1 or 2 minutes of effort into the characters and the director obviously didn't care.",0
"damn, was that a lot to take in. i was pretty much mesmerised throughout. it was pretty perfect, though i would say the editing had a lot to do with that. i can't believe this guy stayed on good terms with the lot of them (anton especially) to get all of this footage without any serious... beef. the dandy's did come off well-together, middle-class kids who took advantage of their situation (and rightly so!). i felt bad for jonestown and especially for anton, which maybe wasn't what a lot of other people felt. great piece of film-making and great choice of subject(s). i recommend this to any music/film fan. you'll probably learn something about film-making.",1
"** here be spoilers **  the government has continued to develop the universalsoldier program, now called unisol. the soldiers are now stronger and are able to take more damage than before. however the government is downsizing, the project endangered and the supercomputer that is in the middle of all feel threatened, so he takes steps to ensure his own safety. he activates and controls the unisols and start to run mayhem. the only one who can stop them is deveraux (van damme).   this movie is about one thing. choreographed fighting. the story is bad, and is soon drowned in all fights. whatever happens, and wherever they go, they fight. unfortunately for this movie, it is no fun watching a fight where you know one part of it is indestructible. normally you're pretty sure the hero will win, but you still want to feel the fights are between two somewhat equal combatants. not where one is indestructible and can't lose. then the fights just become a tool to stretch time. you wait until the final fight when deveraux miraculously finds a way to beat his unbeatable foes. to further lower my opinion, a desperate and sure sign of a bad movie is how much scantily clad women there are. well, there aren't really that lot of them, because the characters are most men (there are at least one woman unisol though), but almost every woman is needlessly shown with at least just a bra once. the female leads get by with this, but we also pass through a strip-club (to use a computer no less) with much more undressed women. these moments do not give anything to the story and is just there to try to please the adolescent-minded male audience.  so, in conclusion, boring fights. no more, no less. well, maybe less...  2/10",0
"the movie ""frailty"" is actually more of a psychological thriller than it is a horror film. it has all the trappings of a horror film but this it is not. ""frailty"" is a film about perceptions of religion and realizing the differences between right and wrong.  in ""frailty"", a middle-aged father (bill paxton) and his two sons claim to be doing the work of god. it turns out that they are a trio of notorious serial killers called ""god's hands"". we watch the father kill the ""demons"" in some rather brutal ways while convincing his sons and himself that they are doing the work god and that what they are doing is right. he claims that he received a message from an angel who gave him specific instructions to eliminate the demons living here on earth. god has given him a list of names and in return for his ""services""; he and his sons will be given protection, which basically means the police will never be able to capture them. we see all of this unfold in front of us in a very disturbing manner. but what is really disturbing about it all is the effect that it has on the two sons, particularly the oldest son, adam. adam himself seriously doubts the existence of a supreme being, that is until his father and a week in the cellar changes all of that. he knows that his father has obviously lost his mind and is pretty sure the same is happening to his younger brother, fenton. fenton, the other half of this puzzle, takes everything in as if it were his own religion. he seems trapped in his father's world of god and demons. i suppose this is because he's so young and easily impressionable. but everything that happens to these three is rather convincing, in fact, too convincing.   the events that occur in the film can be looked upon as a vivid hallucination that is being experienced by the three main characters. i say this because they each react to the situation in different ways and at one point in the film they each claim to see god. dad first sees the murders as his mission. his ""mission"" eventually consumes him and quickly turns into an obsession with eradicating demons. in fact, his hallucination is the primary one. his ""orders"" and the list of names he receives are all a part of this hallucination. watch the scene where dad finds the ax in a barn to figure out where i am coming from. fenton, the younger son, is easily impressed by all of this talk of demons and destruction. since he is so young, it's easy for him to fall into his father's trap. adam, on the other is very skeptical towards his father's actions.   ***spoilers***   in a way, the hallucination ends when dad is killed towards the end of the movie. (i will not say how or under what circumstances). but i will say that it is not pleasant. after his death, it fast-forwards to the present day. (the story is being told through flashbacks, as seen through the eyes of the oldest son adam). in actuality, it is fenton that is telling the story, not adam as originally believed. the story is being told the way he perceived it, through his actions and his brother's actions. fenton has gone insane and is continuing what his father started by luring the fbi agent into his trap.  since religion is a major theme in this movie, the film also plays on how easy it is for religion to be misinterpreted by those that do not have a full understanding of it. before dad discovered his newfound mission, he himself did not have a clear understanding of religion nor did he fully believe in a supreme being. his sons fenton and adam often sang innocent little children's church hymns but yet probably did not have a clear understanding of what the lyrics meant. after the revelation of dad's newfound mission, they both took off in separate directions - adam remained in doubt of there being a supreme being while fenton was gradually sucked into his father's madness.   a very good thriller that will creep the heck out of you, do not watch it alone.",1
"in a lot of his films (citizen kane, confidential report, touch of evil) orson welles gave him the role of an exuberant men. in ""the lady from shanghai"" it's the only time i see him holding the role of the victim. the role of the culprit, he gave it to rita hayworth, i guess it's because he was in love with her. therefore, it's an interesting film. but i find the story excellent too. the direction is genius, as usual with welles : two scenes are particularly brilliant: the one in the aquarium and the final one with the mirrors. this film is brilliant.(10/10)",1
"interesting idea and storyline which didn't quite work.  when you see the film, maybe you will feel as dissatisfied with the ending as i did. i didn't really know who to root for in the movie, taye diggs looked bored as the detective, the rest of the characters seem so one-dimensional and unpleasant.  if the victim alicia(mia kirschner) had been more of a nice girl, we might actually have enjoyed seeing the plot unfold and the perpetrator brought to justice. the problem was that she was as bitchy as the other girls, turning from sweet girl to conniving opportunistic cokehead. i can't understand the moral message of this film, and as a detective story and thriller it doesn't work.",0
"i am a huge fan of the comic book series, but this movie fell way below my expectations. i expected a heavy metal 2000 kinda feel to it.....slow moving, bad dialogue, lots o' blood.....but this was worse than anything i could have imagined.   the plot line is almost the same as the comic, but the good points pretty much stop there. the characters don't have the energy or spirit that drew my attention in the comic series. the movie only covers a small portion of the comic, and the portion used is more slow and boring than later parts. the focus in the movie is on the insignificant events instead of the more interesting overall plot of the comic book.  with the right people working on this project, it could have been amazing. sadly, it wasn't that way, so now there is yet another terrible movie that few will see and even fewer will love. my copy will surely collect dust for years until i finally throw it out.",0
"as the 2000's came to a close, king kong's adopted daughter went ahead and made a tearful announcement her show as coming to an end.  while miss winfrey was tearing up, i was laughing and screaming like a wild indian from the old west.  so what does oprah do? she takes famous people, and puts them on her show. what kind of famous people? people who've suffered (just like her, except these people have lost more than their virginity) they've suffered melted faces (true story), missing limbs (true story, see end of paragraph), and spousal abuse (too many to count). and somehow they come on the show and tell their story, as if we haven't heard it before tons and tons of times (bethany hamilton, i've heard your tale about losing an arm to a shark since day one, which was october 31st, 2003. don't tell me you have no hard feelings.) but the biggest thing probably on oprah was michael jackson's interview in 1993, after being accused of being a child molester. sadly, mr. jackson has since passed away. but that one particular show told about michael's personal life, something not many people knew about at the time.  oprah's real influence comes from middle aged women and soccer moms. they seem to think she's like a personal jesus sometimes. but all i see in oprah is some big ghetto lady who made it big, and she's just showing off how rich she is.  i'm glad her shows going to end soon. we need better television programs.",0
"almost golden: the jessica savitch story  aspect ratio: 1.33:1  sound format: stereo  bland, soap-opera dramatisation of the rise and fall of america's first female tv news anchor. with a tighter script and direction - and a better cast - this might have passed muster, but the flimsy story really wasn't worth the effort. a good documentary on the subject might have been the best way to go. typically strong production values in the tv movie conveyor-belt manner, but it's all as superficial as old fluff, and just as engaging.",0

"i was quite pleased to find this movie in the local video library - cary grant in a comedy set in the services, director stanley donen, so far what's not to like? it's the sort of film that has me wondering two things - when did all involved (including some well-known names) realize they had a turkey on their hands, and what's the worst thing about it among a number of contending aspects? still pondering the first, but my vote for the latter goes to the meandering storyline, ahead of the wordy sometimes pretentious script, the uncertain tone, the lack of consistent and well-developed characterization, and the lack of rapport between the characters. you have to add very uneven acting to the criticism but it's understandable that the actors were struggling with this stuff and in addition seem under-rehearsed. quite often they can hardly get their lines out quick enough. cary grant tries to portray his usual charming and urbane persona but at times seems uneasy and staccato in his delivery. i have to say however that i was relieved when the initial suggestions his character will be paired with the unspeakably vulgar jayne mansfield go away with the appearance of suzy parker. what's to like about the film? - for me chiefly the beauty of parker who also acts with restraint and a grace kelly-like dignity. generally speaking the film is nice to look at. the naval characters are very smart in their uniforms - however you have to truly wonder at the ghastly black fu manchu tunics they don in their luxury hotel suite. even grant can't look elegant in his. back to the credit side, ray walston does a commendable job with his character and for me there was an interest in hearing a pre-hogan's heroes werner klemperer speak without an assumed german accent!",0
"this movie is funny and suitable for any age. it is definitely family-type entertainment. the cast does a fine job playing folks in the mid-western town of big bean, illinois. where we must assume nothing ever happens since the excitement (pre-invasion) of the decade is the new (and only) exit ramp from the interstate. the location appeals as suitably boring and totally unlikely for the invasion of earth by martians. but these martians are totally inept, despite being well-equipped with an arsenal of suitably ghastly and deadly weapons... including one set on eradicating the martians, too! the martians dead-pan their lines and throw in just the right accents to make us the viewers and the locals wish to help them... leave earth. j. j. anderson playing the very young halloween carnivorous duck has just great lines. watch this movie for laugher and entertainment; thought-provoking it isn't. but subtle and enjoyable it is.",1

"""the intruder (l'intrus)"" is a visual pilgrimage through a mysterious life.   grizzled michel subor plays ""louis trebor"" like jason bourne as an old man with a hidden past, living simply in an isolated hut in the woods for justifiably paranoid reasons (but attracting pretty young women who can be useful to him). we learn more about him through dreams, flashbacks and a journey that may unfold chronologically or not, as well as through his brusque interactions with family, lovers, business associates and a striking nemesis. like ""the limey,"" the film resonates with parent/child regrets and a suspicious past revealed through clips from an old film with the same actor as a young man (here paul gégauff's 1965 adventure film ""le reflux"").  in a complete contrast of moods, we meet his son sidney (grégoire colin) who has to be the sexiest house husband in the world, as he sweetly and seductively does household repairs and cares for a baby, a toddler and every need of his working wife. surely director/co-writer claire denis must have created him as a woman's fantasy if ever there was one and a lesson to other filmmakers on filming foreplay. there's an additional extended scene where he seeks his father in the woods while carefully carrying his angelic baby in a pouch. he is everything his father is not and has every relationship his father is incapable of sustaining; no wonder he thinks his father is ""a lunatic."" i spent the rest of the film in dread that something bad would happen to him as the true nature of the heart of his alienated father is very gradually played out before our eyes.  the film is a puzzle, but subor is ruthlessly fascinating as we watch him traverse countries and negotiate nefarious deals, and the voice-over narration for denis's ""beau travail"" was annoying anyway. we have to figure out from skylines and incidental signage that he is traveling to geneva, korea and the south pacific. time passing is indicated by the seasons changing and scars being created and healing. there are lots of images of water for cleansing and for distancing.   continuing her fascination with the morphing of colonialism into globalization, as well as playing a bit on stereotypes of the mysterious orient and russian criminals, denis has incorporated elements from robert louis stevenson, paul gauguin and marlon brando's tahiti idylls and a 40-page memoir by french philosopher jean-luc nancy, the last for the title and heart-transplant plot used for an ironic theme of limited immortality which does have consequences.  while ""louis"" thinks he's succeeded in being above boundaries, rules and morals, there is some amusement in the last act as the locals don't quite know what to do with him and try to help him solve his quixotic odyssey, even as he again lies in isolation.  several people in the audience left in frustration at the elliptical, but strikingly beautiful, story telling method. the unconventional narrative does raise a lot of plot questions on details.",1
"man's castle is a wonderful example of a pre-code film. it involves realistic events with truly enjoyable and imperfect characters. spencer tracy plays bill, a free soul without a dime in his pocket. he makes a living doing odd jobs and traveling to a new city when he gets bored of his surroundings. one night, he meets trina, a beauty by any standards who is cold and alone. she has refused to resort to prostitution so she has not eaten for several days, but the two take very well to each other and form a relationship. his free spirit tempts him to leave her, so life is rocky, but there is a true spark between the two, even if they live in a shack by the river.  tracy is one of the great actors of the silver screen. his characters are amazing and relatable. we can see his thoughts on his face, making him easy to identify with, even if we believe he is behaving badly. young is great in pre-code films. her character is very sweet but far from perfect, making her all the more likable.  pre-code elements include skinny dipping, pregnancy before marriage, and crime.",1

""europa"" is an impressive and anguishing kafkanian story of the great danish director lars von trier. using an expressionist style that recalls fritz lang and alternating a magnificent black & white cinematography with some colored details, this movie discloses a difficult period of germany and some of the problems this great nation had to face after being defeated in the war. very impressive the action of the occupation forces destroying resources that could permit a faster reconstruction of a destroyed country, and the corruption with the jew that should identify max. jean-marc barr has an stunning performance in the role of man that wants to stay neutral but is manipulated everywhere by everybody. the hypnotic narration of max von sydow is another touch of class in this awarded film. my vote is nine.  title (brazil): ""europa""",1

"skullduggery is a strange, strange film based on the novel ""ye shall know them"" by vercors. to unleash criticism at the film feels really unkind, since it is a movie that deals with earnest themes like humanity, and pleas for upright moral standards and tolerance. but in spite of its honourable intentions and its well-meaning tone, skullduggery simply isn't a very good film. for me, the main problem is the terribly disjointed narrative which can't make its mind up how best to convey its message. the first half of the movie is like watching a standard jungle expedition flick of the tarzan ilk; later it teeters into sci-fi fable; by the end it slips into courtroom melodramatics. the differences in tone between each section of the movie are too great, too jarring, to overlook. they stick out like a sore thumb and remind you constantly that you're watching a muddled, disorganised movie.  an archaeological expedition into the jungles of new guinea is led by adventurer douglas temple (burt reynolds). one of the main archaeologists involved in the excursion is attractive lady scientist dr sybil greame (susan clark). after an arduous trek they stumble upon a tribe of strange ape-like creatures. these primitive, long-lost people are covered in hair and have survived for centuries without being in any way touched or influenced by the developments of modern man. there is some evidence that they may the ancestors of early man  the ""missing link"" in the evolution of apes into humans. or perhaps a race of humans who simply look and behave differently from usual? or even a race of animals that have begun to develop human characteristics? the archaeologists call the tribe ""the tropi"" and are initially thrilled by the implications of their discovery. but things take a devastating turn when nasty opportunist vancruysen (paul hubschmid) declares his intention to exploit the tribe and their idyll on behalf of developers. he questions whether the tropi are truly ""human"" and takes his argument to the courts, where he hopes to be granted legal backing so that his own greedy ambitions can be continued.  this was a very early film in reynolds' career, and he actually unbalances this movie by acting like he's in a comedy while the rest of the cast take it all very seriously. not that reynolds can be blamed  he has an impossible role, asked to play a charming adventurer who really belongs in a tarzan flick. his character and the film are not relevant to each other. clark fares much better as the earnest lady archaeologist, and there are nice supporting roles for british actors edward fox, alexander knox and wilfrid hyde-white. a major shortcoming in skullduggery is the lame and ineffective make-up used to give the tropi their strange hairy appearance. rather than making the actors look like believable hominoids, the stuck-on hair merely makes them look unintentionally comical. and that's just not the right idea. we're meant to feel great sympathy for these creatures, but that's awfully hard when they look so unconvincing. skullduggery is a failed attempt to tell a story that could have been poignant, philosophical and stimulating. the honourable intentions are there for all to see, but the end result doesn't do them justice. a worthy failure it might be but a failure nonetheless.",0
"ah, mcbain the character name is immortalized and forever ridiculed by ""the simpsons"" but it will also always  to me personally, at least  remain the name and title of a tremendously entertaining and outrageously violent early 90's action flick; directed by the cool dude who brought us ""the exterminator"" and starring two of the most ultimately badass b-movie heroes christopher walken and michael ironside (the latter with a cute little macho ponytail). i guess ""mcbain"" will largely have to be labeled as a guilty pleasure, because there's no way i can convince anyone this is an intellectual motion picture. the film is unimaginably preposterous (most action heroes take on a small gangster posse  mcbain takes on an entire country) and yet takes itself way too seriously. the script is a non-stop and incoherent spitfire of clichéd situations, nonsensical twists, compulsory sentimental interludes, grotesquely staged action sequences and utterly implausible character drawings. it's a totally delirious movie; i loved it.   vietnam pow mcbain's life is saved by fellow soldier roberto santos on the very last day of the war. they each keep half a dollar note as a symbol that mcbain is in santos' debt. eighteen years later, santos is a spirited rebel leading the revolution against the corrupt president of his home country columbia. santos initial attempt to take over the power fails and he's publicly executed on el presidente's balcony. his sister travels to new york with the dollar note and turns to mcbain for financial assistance and manpower. mcbain and his former vietnam buddies, who all coincidentally happen to be fed up with the injustice in this world, charter themselves a miserable little plane and fly to columbia to open a gigantic can of whoop-ass.   okay, let's not fool each other here. the fact you're reading a user- comment on ""mcbain"" already indicates that you have some sort of interest for low-budget b-movie action. one of my fellow reviewers spent quite some time composing a list containing all the main stupidities and insensible moments of ""mcbain"". this list is totally accurate and i can only concur with it. heck, i could even add some more senseless sequences to that list (like the preposterous and needless heroic self- sacrifice of a soldier who doesn't even have any affinity with the goal of the mission and the rest of mcbain's squad), but what's the point? you definitely know not to expect a 100% coherent and plausible masterpiece. we know from beforehand this will be a silly and exaggeratedly flamboyant movie, and it's maybe even the exact reason why we want to check it out! this is a terrifically outrageous and exciting movie about a bunch of former vietnam buddies turning into mercenaries and declaring war against the corrupt columbian president and the national drug cartel. please don't expect another ""apocalypse now"". this particular motion picture relies on the ruff 'n tuff acting performances of the macho leads, a whole lot of explosions and gunfights and  last but not least  a fantastic soundtrack in which joan baez sings a cover of ""brothers in arms"".",1
"it's a pretty good cast, but the film has nowhere near the grace of the original italian comedy ""big deal on madonna street"" anyone looking for an entertaining caper film should visit the original. william macy may be one of our greatest living actors, but here he's put to little use. and his role in the original was played by marcello mastroianni, so i sort of feel sorry for him trying to fill those shoes. might as well try to imitate bogart or a young de niro. the art direction is rich and textured but brings nothing to the story, the extra bits they add to the story feel completely unnecessary and the things they take away are missed. even starting the way they do seems bizarrely gratuitous and takes away from the surprise of the original. sam rockwell has his odd and genial charm and luis guzman has that odd charisma, but the love story part of the movie just seems clunky and flat. it's too bad nobody has figured out how to make this movie as well as it was first made, but then again it's too bad we live in a culture where we feel like we need to remake amazing things instead of simply learning to savor the originals.",0

the family moves away from upstate new york to berlin. bang. it is 1938, the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright. what kind of plays does he write? in what language? is he successful? his wife is an actress and looks glamorous. the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same. he does not. why? because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american? because he is successful? because his wife is? because he likes his life there? because he likes the nazis? because he is just plain lazy and doesn't like change? don't ask me.  possibly, the man just does not care, is not interested in politics, is a kind of an existentialist. he states that he is deeply in love with his wife. he speaks of his republic of two (meaning he and his wife). there is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie, it much more seems a republic of one.  on the request of an american agent campbell, jr., agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines. the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short, unexciting and anti climactic, the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation, the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast.  so now we have campbell, jr., presenting himself over the air as the last free american. the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting - although one wonders what happened when campbell, jr., really and honestly had to cough, hiccup etc. (must have scrambled the messages terribly). anyway, the nazis lose, the wife dies (touring in the crimean for german troops - i never heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii), campbell, jr., says he goes to the russian front but does not go, is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug (how come?), is dragged to a sight-seeing tour in auschwitz, is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york.  and this is where the story really starts   bang. from now on it is like a short story by paul auster. it is 1961, campbell, jr., lives in new york tenement as a has-been and mourns the loss of his wife. nobody really cares - or do they? yes, somehow they do, and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction. auschwitz survivors. a painter. some american supremacists discover"" him and want him to be their figurehead. they even find his presumed dead wife for him, or is she his wife? anyway, in the end campbell, jr., calls in at the israeli consulate, and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment, placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann's. he writes his life story and, once this task finished, hangs himself on the typewriter's ribbons without getting sooty the least bit.  while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss, i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone. so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss. amazingly, many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero, having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american. i assume according to them this took a lot of courage. as a matter of fact, however, the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win-win situation, as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war. the danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the story.  one might argue, that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything. but even then it fails to make a point, primarily, i suspect, because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat. this is a pity, especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee, a talented, versatile and sensuous actress. she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent. another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts (confession, broadcast and hidden messages), but i guess this is largely unfilmable. maybe i should give the book a chance.",0
"i rated this movie as awful (1). after watching the trailer, i thought this movie could be pretty cool. ""guaranteed to offend...everyone!"" the trailer said. well...it did offend me, because this movie really sucks. it is hardly a comedy, as i laughed about two seconds during the entire movie. and what's with all the gays in this movie? i'm not gay and i don't have a problem with those who are, but what's the point of adding so many gay-scenes in a so called comedy movie, when these scenes are absolutely not funny? i guess the director is a gay man in denial, or something like that.  so my advice to you is: if you want to waste good money, go rent a good comedy you've already seen a million times, you'll be better off than watching this mother of all lousy comedy's. it really is total crap.",0
"i have not read the novel, or anything other by kurt vonnegut, but i am now intending to start. this grips you from the very first frame, and does not let go until the end credits start rolling. taking you places you don't expect, the plot is interesting throughout. the pacing is spot-on, nothing lasts too long, and this does a perfect job of balancing between unexpected twists and allowing the viewer to process what we've seen. it is well-told and well-thought out. i've never watched a film that i feel i could particularly compare this to. it is intense and exciting, as well as funny and sad. the acting is excellent, nolte absolutely shines, goodman again proves that he doesn't have to go for laughs, and lee and arkin are spellbinding. i could go on, really... no role is treated to a less than stellar performance. the editing and cinematography are marvelous, and all of the visuals are great, with a couple of unforgettable and astonishing ones. i am going to go for other movies directed by keith gordon, as well as the other two apparently related to this, through the author of the books. there is one scene of sexuality, and a lot disturbing and unsettling content in this. i recommend this to anyone who can appreciate it; it is not pleasant. 8/10",1
"i'm watching this on the star world network overseas which buys american and canadian series that last one or two seasons like the jane show. i thought of how many female lead comedy shows im actually able to watch on my own, there's lucy, bewitched, i dream of jeanie (the one with barbara feldman), and then my mind goes kind of blank i cannot think of any others, the women are all supporting roles not the lead. so for me, the jane show is in pretty good company. one thing i just thought of though. i've watched several things made in canada, and i never recall any thing being filmed in a regular tv series that shows snow! it's all made at the height of summer, lol! granted it's a great place to live climate wise in the summer but you would think, they would show a little bit of canada in the winter since that's part of the lifestyle there also. i mean sctv, just for laughs come to mind as two comedy shows that lasted a long time filmed in canada and very little or none is shot with snow present even though they both do a lot of outdoor shots. i digress but i kind of chuckle at jane and her obviously liberal ways being accused of racism to her neighbor, and i like the bald guy and his craziness, i found it on par with a uk series called the it crowd (i think) another office comedy with a female lead. not by any means the best comedy ever but for a guy to say he can watch it alone, thats saying something. if i was with my wife she might really enjoy it since it addresses sex in the office and stuff like that so might be a good light comedy for couples to watch. 7 of 10.",1
"cb4 was awful, but it may have given cundieff the idea to it better. more like spinal tap than anything else, the film is clever from the start. surprising anyone who saw it back in the mid nineties. the performances are played for laughs but not so much so that they are cartoon characters, more like marx brothers. these guys are real and slightly diverse. they react to situations like any of us might. well, we may not throw a tantrum when our performance hats are late to the gig, or pull guns and beat down a record company exec, but you get the picture. n(n***as) w(with) h(hats) takes itself seriously enough to reel you in, then you're hooked. rent or get this at all costs, even if you're not really into rap music, this will still leave you gassing out loud. comparing this to cb4 is like comparing george lucas' star wars to gil gerards'buck rogers' i think you see my point",1
"i just don't get some of the big premises of this episode - that miranda is so remarkable, and that there's anything so ugly it would make you insane. someone here made the remark that maybe it's the frequency of the light waves or something rather than it being ugliness. miranda is just a jerk. the episode is slow, inconsistent and way too talky. i also don't quite understand why kolos is an ambassador - why doesn't the federation just leave the damn medusans be? there's one part i do like, when kolos is speaking through spock about the loneliness of the human experience. overall, i love tos and even at its lamest, i'll always tune in. this episode though - mmm, i wouldn't purchase it except for a used copy under $3.",0
"absolute garbage, worse fight scenes than a 20 year old van damme movie or american ninja etc.  truly dire acting, not a skill in sight in the entire movie its like a cast of wooden sculptures.  watch it just for how truly bad this film is, it may have been acceptable in the 80s but this is a 2006 movie, i don't have much love for this movie as it wasn't born in the 80s.  if you like real fight movies then check out tony jaa in ong bak and the protector, those are proper martial arts films.  have a laugh and watch this today you may see the unintenional humour at how grim it is.",0
"1928 is in many ways a ""lost year"" in motion pictures. just as some of the finest films of the silent era were being made in every genre, sound was coming in and - while reaping great profits at the box office - was setting the art of film-making back about five years as the film industry struggled with the new technology.  ""show people"" is one of the great silent era comedies. the film shows that william haines had comic skills beyond his usual formula of the obnoxious overconfident guy who turns everyone against him, learns his lesson, and then redeems himself by winning the football game, the polo game, etc. this movie is also exhibit a for illustrating that marion davies was no susan alexander kane. she had excellent comic instincts and timing. this film starts out as the beverly hillbillies-like adventure of peggy pepper (marion davies) and her father, general marmaduke oldfish pepper, fresh from the old south. general pepper has decided that he will let some lucky movie studio executive hire his daughter as an actress. while at the studio commissary, the peppers run into billy boone (william haines), a slapstick comedian. he gets peggy an acting job. she's unhappy when she finds out it is slapstick, but she perseveres. eventually she is discovered by a large studio and she and billy part ways as she begins to take on dramatic roles. soon the new-found fame goes to her head, and she is about to lose her public and gain a royal title when she decides to marry her new leading man, whom she doesn't really love, unless fate somehow intervenes.  one of the things mgm frequently does in its late silent-era films and in its early sound-era films is feature shots of how film-making was done at mgm circa 1930. this film is one of those, as we get charlie chaplin trying to get peggy's autograph, an abundance of cameos of mgm players during that era including director king vidor himself, and even a cameo of marion davies as peggy seeing marion davies as marion davies arriving at work on the lot. peggy grimaces and mentions that she doesn't care for her. truly a delight from start to finish, this is a silent that is definitely worth your while. this is one of the films that i also recommend you use to introduce people to the art of silent cinema as it is very accessible.",1

"i, like many other bachchan fans, having been eagerly awaiting the remake of sholay. this movie was not it. thank god they didn't let them use the name ""sholay"" in the movie title. ram gopal's remake is not worthy of the title. the camera work, the locations, the costumes, the totally out-of-place dancing, the dialogue all combined to make the worst movie i have ever seen. you wonder if the cast of actors agreed to make this movie because they needed money and ram gopal was paying a lot of money for the cast. the only non-paid actor, the ant, was the only resemblance to the first movie. abishek's role was totally ridiculous, did he need money to pay for the wedding to ash? save your money, your mind and your time, don't bother with this movie or the dvd when that comes out.",0
"we bought the dvd set of ""es war einmal das leben"" (german) / ""once upon a time... life"" (english) for our bilingual kids because everyone loved the ""es war einmal der mensch"" (german) / ""once upon a time... man"" (english) series (us parents had seen it as kids) and it has exceeded even high expectations! the series is very well made, does not show its age, and our kids at various ages really like to watch it. at the same time, they learn things us parents didn't know until way, way later. the series covers everything to do with the human body from organs, all senses, blood, infection, antibodies, and much more in animated 20-25 min episodes. topics some people may find ""sensible"", such as digestion and reproduction are covered in a tasteful, discreet and child-friendly manner (the reproduction episode starts coverage mainly where the baby starts growing), while still (as typical) informative and fun.  children are usually fascinated with how their bodies work and through the episodes gain an understanding of this in the context of their environment. the format of the episodes switches between the outside world (a family with 2 children) and the inside of the body. for example, in the episode covering infections, the boy cuts himself accidentally and the wound gets infected and the episode covers how the body reacts to this. similarly, the episodes on the senses, e.g. hearing, seeing, link what happens inside the body to the context of the outside world and the episode on respiration and circulation of oxygen in the blood covers the complete lifecycle including (briefly) where the oxygen comes from (plants).  this is one of the best ever children's programs - i would say it's a must see for every family with kids!",1
"i really, really enjoyed watching this movie! at first, seeing its poster i thought it was just another easy romantic comedy ... but it is simply more than this! i personally believe that this idea (that i'm sure a good part of the viewers had just before they saw the movie) it's yet another important part of the big concept of this movie itself (or even of its marketing strategy)! what i mean is: nowadays we are slaves to images! to impressions! i went to the cinema to view this film having the wrong impression, the wrong expectations, and at the end i felt how superficial i could be! to exemplify it comes to my mind the sequence near the end in which sidney buys the plane ticket to go back to new york and as he is asked to 'give an autograph', meaning to sign for the ticket, he believes that just because he got on tv thanks to the scandal at the awards he is now some kind of celebrity. and this is just, i believe, the climax of this main theme around which the movies revolves. above this, i believe the movie also offers us a solution to get along with this, illustrated throughout the movie by sidney's attitude: don't become too serious about yourself or about anybody else ... ""even saints were people in the beginning"" ... as sophie once says in the movie. the saints of the moment are the stars. we attribute them an 'aura' of perfection, of eternal happiness, but the reality is much less than that. even the saints of any religion are images, ideal models of how to behave and how to live your life. even they were not for real ... they became 'for real' after they died and we looked back at them. and that's the catch: we need our saints! we need our stars! we strive for them as if it wasn't for them we wouldn't have anything to strive for. and television and all other media are means to create and capture our strivings. we desperately need benchmarks in regard to which to measure ourselves. and that's how we got in the cinema to watch this movie in the first place: to see if we can fit the benchmark, or if the benchmark is to small for us. this time it was larger than we expected.",1
"this was my second time watching the film (via the french-language version as opposed to the first, which was dubbed in italian) and i feel that it improves on subsequent viewings.  a compelling if slowly built-up character study that's beautifully shot and with the parisian settings being equally impressive. in the long run, it's not top-grade polanski and i would rank it at number 9 in his filmography but it's still a confident mix of subtle chills and, surprisingly, often broad comedy. it also features a fine cast, all of whom are in good form, but especially isabelle adjani, melvyn douglas and jo van fleet.  even so, i'm a bit baffled by the sudden compulsion for trelkovsky to 'change' into the previous tenant; apart from the owner of the café opposite the apartment building, where he is given whatever simone used to have without asking him if he wished any different, there is little to indicate (as far as i could discern, anyway) that this is what everybody wanted of him! okay, so he found simone's belongings still lying in the apartment but what exactly drove him to wear her dresses and make himself up as her (even if he apparently started doing this unconsciously)? following his nightmarish visions in the bathroom, the last section of the film (where adjani all but disappears) is almost anti-climactic - especially the scene where the landlord and the other tenants witness his attempted suicide as if it were a night at the opera, a concept which had already been used 46 years earlier by jean cocteau in the blood of a poet (1930)!  the ending, then, is at once predictable and unresolved: just what made the two occupants of this particular apartment jump out of the window?!; i remember this factor bugging me on first viewing as well, and i'm sorry to say it's no clearer now! mind you, the film's first two-thirds are pretty solid but i wish that polanski had been less reliant on obscure plot points throughout.",1
"i may be getting ahead of myself here, but although the film itself was a technical masterpiece for its time, i watched it piece-by-piece on tcm last night, the question arises to me: why did they do that? putting their lives in jeopardy, many of them died on the trek, why would they undertake such a life-endangering journey, just to find food for their animals (!) once they reached the ""land of milk and honey"", why didn't they just stay there? would you endanger your life, and that of your entire community, just to find food for a herd of cattle? as dangerous as it was, to do it for that purpose alone, shows the inbred simplicity of these types of people. risk death for a cow?? better them than i!",1
"i watched this film recently on dvd and i have to say i wasn't impressed. i know it's taboo to knock independent films, but this one felt devoid of entertainment.  the premise was interesting, but the execution of it fell short. i found myself thinking ""okay, they're just getting into it, the story will pick up soon"". before i knew it, the film was over and the story never picked up. i can't say i found the acting all that impressive either. it was pretty bad. not star wars prequel trilogy bad, but bad nonetheless.  i'm not sure what the running time was, i'll assume two hours (because it's a safe estimate). anyway, when the film was finished, i felt as though i deserved some kind of recognition for the will power i exerted in not stopping the film and walking away halfway through.  again, i was thoroughly unimpressed, and eventually bored out of my wits. i'm not one of those guys who requires fast-paced action and explosions in a film, so don't start in on me as that being a reason for not liking it.",0
"wwe's last ppv of 2006, proved to be a hit with the fans, but for one reason only, the ladder match which was only scheduled to be paul london and brian kendrick against william regal and dave taylor. but with the recent crap ppv being december to dismember, wwe knew that it had to do something to get the fans talking again, this proved useful when it introduced mnm and the hardy boyz to the mix and announced that the match was going to be a ladder match.  the match was brutal and one of the best ladder matches i have ever seen, but joey mercury's face was a total mess. johnny nitro didn't even check on his partner, they just carried on like nothing happened, and taylor and regal did nothing during the match except hit people with a few ladder shots. in the end london and kendrick retained the titles.  elsewhere on the show kane defeated mvp in a decent inferno match when he set mvp's stupid costume on fire. chris benoit downed chavo guerrero in a decent match, gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the wwe cruiserweight title in a solid effort.  but the main event was a total mess, king booker teamed with finlay to take on john cena and batista. the action was shoddy and no one cared who batista picked for his partner.  overall results: kane defeated mvp in an inferno match.  paul london and brian kendrick retained the wwe tag team titles against the hardy boyz, mnm and david taylor and william regal in a ladder match.  chris benoit defeated chavo guerrero to retain the us title in a decent match.  gregory helms defeated jimmy wang yang to retain the cruiserweight championship.  the boogeyman beat the miz in a terrible match.  the undertaker defeated mr kennedy in a last ride match.  john cena and batista defeated king booker and finlay in an abysmal match.  overall grade - b",1
"i was fortunate enough to meet george pal (and still have my ds:tmob poster autographed by him) at a convention shortly after the release, and asked him why he chose to do the film ""camp"". before he could answer, two studio flacks intercepted and lectured me on how the studio ""knew best"" and how ""no one will take such a film seriously"". i had been reading the bantam reprints for a couple of years thanks to a friend (comicon attendees of the 1970s will recall blackhawk and his band? i was in a couple of years of that with him), and had higher hopes than what we got.  the flacks insisted that no high adventure would ever be done seriously, and so doing 'camp' was the only way. several other fans jumped in on my side, with pal listening as best he could. at the end of the little event, pal came up to us and apologized, wishing he could have done more and better.  star wars put the lie to the flacks, and a year after pal's death, spielberg and lucas proved that doc savage could have easily been the next major movie franchise...if it hadn't been for the flacks.  tear out the memory or history of doc, and the film would have been worth a 6/10 rating as nothing more than a mindless popcorn seller.  but destroying the legacy like that was no less an abomination than killing a baby in the crib.  doc savage can still come to the screen, and survive the inevitable comparisons by the ill-informed to indiana jones, but it would have to be done in all seriousness and earnest to reclaim the glory that we should expect from the first american superhero.  sidenotes: yes, there was a second script for archenemy of evil, and it's a lot more serious. yes, there was simultaneous footage shot, but mostly establishing shots and very little with actors. and, yes, there _is_ a one-sheet of ron ely leaping over a brick wall and blasting at something over his shoulder with a specially built bronze pistol. ely's wearing a duster over a button down white shirt with a bronze tie, and the words ""doc savage: archenemy of evil...coming next summer!"" postscript: if anyone knows who the studio flacks were that accompanied george pal in 1975 to san diego for the convention, smack the idiots up the side of the head and call them the idiots that they are. at the time, they were doing dorkknobs and fu manchu in stripes and baggy canvas pants, and carrying paramount portfolios.",0

"this is a docudrama story on the lindy chamberlain case and a look at it's impact on australian society. it especially looks at the problem of innuendo, gossip and expectation when dealing with real-life dramas.  one issue the story deals with is the way it is expected people will all give the same emotional response to similar situations. not everyone goes into wild melodramatic hysterics to every major crisis. just because the characters in the movies and on tv act in a certain way is no reason to expect real people to do so. this is especially apt for journalists and news editors who appear to be looking for the the big sob scene that will pull the ratings. it's an issue that has to be constantly addressed.  the leads play the characters with depth, personality and sensitivity. and they are ably supported by a large cast all playing based-on-fact individuals. some viewers may be surprised to learn that many of the supporting cast in this story are people better known in australia as comic actors. it re-enforces my idea that comic actors make some of the best supports in dramas because with comedy they know how to establish quick impressions of individuals.  (spoiler warning!)  i have to say something very personal here; in that i am actually an ex-adventist who was a practicing member in australia at the time this incident occurred; so i have a slightly different impression of the story than most. i think it is handled with amazing creativity and personality, and emotional heart. i think the best scene is the one where the couple are hounded by the new choppers. it captured the themes of the story brilliantly.  i once heard fred schepsi say in an interview that he told the actors to ""play the best case for their character they could"". while this is especially apt for this story, i think it is also a general principle that should apply to all acting as well.",1
"the following are some of the most blaring problems with this movie: 1) clichés abound. seriously, awful ""twists"" are everywhere.  2) the narrative jumps around in time, which would be fine if done well, but it's not.  3) lame characters that don't develop so much as either remain utterly static, or drastically change for no good reason.  4) big one: horrible acting. over the top from nearly every person.  the following are some of the best points from the movie: 1) the lead is damn good looking.  as i see it, there are only two kinds of people who would be into this movie: a) people who can sit through 90 minutes of tripe simply because the lead is attractive.  b) people who often think to themselves, ""i like hollywood dreck rife with clichés and overacting, but if only i could watch it in korean..."" there's a lot of good korean cinema out there, so why waste your time with garbage?",0
"john carradine, john ireland, and faith domergue who as players all saw better days in better films got together for this grade g horror film about life imitating art in a mysterious mansion.  for carradine it was in those last two decades of his career that he appeared in anything on the theory it was better to keep working no matter what you did and get those paychecks coming in. with that magnificent sonorous voice of his, carradine was always in great demand for horror pictures and the man did not discriminate in the least in what he appeared in.  he plays the caretaker of an old gothic mansion who movie director john ireland has rented for his latest low budget slasher film. it's even got a graveyard, but with a missing occupant. faith domergue is ireland's aging star and carole wells is the young ingenue.  in the last twenty minutes or so most of the cast winds up dead that aren't dead already. the script is so incoherent i'm still trying to figure out the point. i won't waste any more gray matter on it.",0

"on september 11th, 2001, millions were killed; but 2,819 lives ended in an especially gruesome manner. they were the victim of a plane hijacking by extremists whose sole mission was to destroy buildings, but more importantly, people. this film takes an in-depth look at four people whose lives were cut short by this disastrous event and one man whose life was shattered by the loss of their lives.  charlie fineman (played by adam sandler), a former dentist living in new york, loses his wife and three children on september 11th as they were on their way to los angeles. emotionally annihilated by the events, he eventually loses touch with everyone who reminds him of his former life; including his in-laws and his best friend (played, respectively, by robert klein, melinda dillon, and mike bender). he goes into completely denial and does his best to forget about his former life. this continues until he runs into his old college friend alan johnson (played by don cheadle) who fineman doesn't seem to remember. the two begin to catch up, but fineman believes johnson was sent by people from his former life to persuade him into finding help. slowly, but surely, fineman regains his trust for johnson.  while all this is happening, alan johnson's life is going down the wrong path. he is a self man (dentist) who helps start a dental practice. one day, a patient of his named donna remar (played by saffron burrows) attempts to make a move on him, telling him that she would like to perform oral sex for him. this is an unwelcome surprise to dr. johnson since he is a married man with two children. as he is coming home from work on a particular workday, he sees his old friend (fineman) and tries to flag him down. he is unsuccessful, but he gets another opportunity and persuades fineman to get a come of coffee with him to catch up, despite the fact that fineman doesn't know who he is.  one of the most interesting things about this movie is its use of music as a motif. one of fineman's physiological crutches is music, particularly springsteen and other classic rock artists. when fineman is asked to open up about his past or to talk about things he finds unpleasant, he puts on his earphones and drowns out the world with things his music.  when the film was over, i had me thinking: how would i cope with the loss of my family? how would i deal with such a tragic events. it's something we don't really think about too often. we always think they'll be there and we often take them for granted, whether we intend to or not. we usually realize how important they are when it's too late; and a blow like that can destroy someone physically, emotionally, and physiologically. i really don't know how i would be able to deal with something like that. would i face the problem head on, cope, and move on with my life or would i just put my headphones on and block the world?",1
"finally, the uncut version of ""baby face"" surfaces and from what source? the library of congress. the restored four minutes, snippets here and there, make for a much better film. we now know that baby face was pimped by her old man from the time she was at least fourteen years of age. another reason d'tat for her behavior and cold, calculating exterior.  barbara stanwyck is indeed amazing in the role of lily powers (notice the moniker), a part that called for just the right amount of sexuality coated with power, cunning, and revenge, yet tinged with virginal pretense when called for, a very difficult portrayal to make convincing. barbara stanwyck conveys the necessary nuances to show that though she sleeps her way to the top (literally), she still has good in her heart--note the way she treats those few who have been kind to her such as chico (the marvelous actress theresa harris) and the old philosopher. and though she exploits her sexuality to make mush of men who are rich and powerful, those same men are attempting to exploit her for their carnal desires with no intention of permanent ties until they fall in love with her.  lily powers fails to understand, at first, that emotions are difficult to ride, that it's easy to lose control. one possible result is death. hitching a wagon to a star of course materialism can take one to a destination where nothing else exists but the ephemeral, and it's a cold lonely location.  a word should be said about the philosophy of friedrich nietzsche whose will to power is stressed in ""baby face"" by the elderly philosopher who befriends lilly when she is still turning tricks for her old man. ""baby face"" was released the same year adolf hitler came to power in germany. though it's highly unlikely that the semi-literate hitler understood much about nietzsche, he considered himself a nietzschean to the nth degree and touted it along side his other rantings. ""baby face"" serves as an indictment of the popular interpretation of nietzsche's will to power concept, especially in the final scenes.  although ""you've got the cutest little baby face."" is apropos as a theme for ""baby face,"" an even more telling and applicable melody is w. c. handy's ""st. louis blues"" played throughout the film, especially at times when the camera has to drift away from what would otherwise be sexually explicit scenes. ""st. louis blues"" is also used wisely toward the end as lily begins to see beyond materialism to eternal values. chico is singing a raw, salacious version of ""st. louis blues"" when lily, now disagreeing with the lyrics, orders her to stop.  the restored version of ""baby face"" makes the film more modern in its approach and attitude toward sex as power than many a new hollywood release. by all means watch this gem from the distant past and enjoy.",1
"i can't recommend this film as a date movie. gary oldman's semi-autobiographical account of life lived on a south east london estate is a violent, beckettian account of one of dante's circles of hell, frankly. at the centre of it is ray winstone, who has done this sort of character before but never as well. the film opens with him ordering drinks at a pub bar - that's all - and you are already gripped with a sense of the frustration, self-loathing and barbarism that he exhibits in many different ways throughout the course of the movie. it's an acting masterclass.  of course the stymied and dispossessed need a foil in a drama such as this and winstone is matched by kathy burke as his long-suffering wife, who absorbs and ultimately rejects his unbearable behaviour. charlie creed-miles does an able turn as the fuse-lighting druggie son billy although he must have wondered sometimes exactly what he let himself in for. gary oldman directs close up on the actors, maximising the claustrophobia of their council flat squalor. 4/10",0
i've had to change my view on the worst film in the world having just seen this one. this is it!  make no mistake this film is awful.  here's a list of reasons:  hopeless storyline (despite being based on a true story). dreadful acting (what was judge reinhold thinking) unbelieveably bad stunts. childish dialogue. non-existent continuity. lack of atmosphere.  get the picture?  ,0
"the line is funnier in england, where, away from vixen!'s native america, the word ""fanny"" has a whole new meaning. sadly, it's the only laugh you'll get in this terrible sex comedy that is neither sexy nor funny.  oddly unalluring with painted-on eyebrows, erica gavin (acting ability: zero) is a nymphomaniac who lusts after her own brother, but rejects his black friend while making derogatory remarks about watermelons. as if in revenge, he asks her if she would go with a shetland pony. reference is also made to ""making it with monkeys"". gavin's ability to shake and tremble with orgasmic pleasure at the slightest touch is matched only in it's lack of appeal by her seduction dance  which involves a bonfire and a haddock. personally, i preferred the haddock.  for '68 this was pretty tame stuff, and belies the controversy it attracted at the time. a character claims to be ""getting stoned"", though it's only on bourbon, and for one of the original ""x"" certificates, there's no full frontal nudity. just six years later we would be getting timmy lea and his confessions, but here we have to make do with topless shots. only gavin's final seduction of her own brother really shocks. another activity for vixen is where she helps settle the sexual problems between a married couple by sleeping with them both. the two women clearly aren't enjoying acting out their scene together, and make a poor effort to disguise it. after vixen irons out their disharmony, the romantic husband concludes of his wife ""i guess she's got it coming to her!""  the only near-worthwhile segment involves an unusual discussion of cuban communism. it seems out of place with the rest of the film, though is spliced with shots of gavin's breasts to rope it in to continuity. this then leads into a vague anti-vietnam stance, which is commendable, though dropped in the middle of such a frivolous film it seems trite and insensitive, not to say downright tasteless. incidentally, the part of would-be communist niles brooke is taken by harrison page, the same harrison page who played captain trunk in amusing comedy sledge hammer! page must be embarrassed by his back catalogue (which also includes meyer's beyond the valley of the dolls), though meyer apologists would have you believe the terrible dialogue, lousy acting, sloppy direction and dire editing are not just part of the charm, but wholly intentional. as a defence, it fails to hold water.  the irritating incidental music  a cross between the tunes they play in cinema restaurant ads and muzak used by tv stations when the transmission breaks down  is omnipresent and intrusive; while even the silly, amateurishly skewed camera angles can't generate interest. a wonderful world of jazz saxophones, where women have been ""asking for it"", black men  or ""shines""  aren't good enough for anyone, and rape is an acceptable form of revenge. absolutely abysmal.",0

"the unborn tells the tale of a married couple named virginia (brooke adames) & bradley marshall (jeff hayenga) who have tried for the last five years to conceive, virginia has had two miscarriages since then & is desperate to have a child. they visit dr. richard meyerling (james karen) for help after he is recommended by some of their friends, dr. meyerling says he will be able to help them have a child. dr. meyerling operates on virginia & it is soon confirmed that the surgery has been a success & virginia is pregnant. at first everything seems perfect & the marshall's couldn't be happier, but their picture perfect lives don't last for long as virginia's pregnancy develops problems, she becomes moody & acts totally out of character & she receives a worrying phone call from beth (jane cameron), another woman who has undergone dr. meyerling's procedure, who claims that meyerling is in fact using his patients for his own sinister ends & is in fact a disgraced genetic researcher. virginia begins to question just what is growing inside of her...  produced & directed by rodman flender i actually thought the unborn was a decent horror/thriller (it's definitely not a sci-fi film as the imdb would have you believe) that pleasantly surprised me. the script by henry dominic tries to be different & it must take some credit for that at least. the unborn goes for psychological horror rather than cheap scares & bad special effects, it's got quite a clever story that works & plays on basic human fears. it moves along at a fair pace although it's not exactly an action packed film by any means. the climax was good & seemed a fitting way to round things off & the warnings about messing around with genetics seem even more relevant today than it must have been back then, maybe flender knew something the rest of us didn't. on the down side it lacks some exploitation elements & is at heart a dialogue driven film mostly focusing on one person so it can get a bit dull at times. also, i have to mention it, what on erath was that grinning black skateboarding dwarf all about eh?!  director flender does an ok job, the unborn is far from the most stylish or visually interesting film ever made but it's good enough. the atmosphere is good & there's a fair bit of tension as what virginia has inside of her & dr. meyerling's sinister plans aren't fully revealed until the last possible moment. disappointingly the blood & gore is almost non existent which in a way lets the film down because in retrospect nothing really memorable happens, the unborn relies on good storytelling which is fine but in a week i doubt i'll remember too much about it.  technically the film is ok, i'd imagine that the unborn had a pretty low budget but it's well made even if it's a little bland & forgettable. the baby creature is actually a decent special effect & has fairly realistic facial movement. the acting is good & this was one of the first acting jobs credited to friends (1994 - 2004) star lisa kudrow, i have to be honest i don't like friends & i don't even know who she was in this so i can't tell you how she did.  the unborn is a good horror/thriller that deserves to be more widely known & seen, it's far better than a lot of low budget crap that litter video shop shelves. if your a horror fan & are looking for something a bit different, something slightly more intelligent & thought provoking than usual then i think you could do a lot worse than the unborn. followed by a dumbed down sequel the unborn ii (1994) which i watched straight after this, check my review out if you want..",1

"a killer, cannibal rapist is killed by a crazed cop on the scene of his latest murder. at his grave a cult have gathered with plans to resurrect him by peeing onto the grave. this of course works and he awakes ripping the guys penis off and he is back into his old killing ways with an all new zombie look. the two cops one of who is going a little crazy about the scum of the city and has a drug problem, are back on the case. two of the original cult member also tries to stop the killer by resurrecting some other kind of dead thing. thinking they have filed they leave but out from the grave comes a plastic baby doll that was used in the original resurrection. sounds a bit confusing really but no its just rubbish.  the acting is terrible and one of the cops is the same guy that plays dr vincent van gore in the faces of gore series and he is just as terrible as the annoying cop in this film. the other cop just about struggles to get his terrible lines out. now i'm all for low budget cinema but this film is just terrible. if it wasn't for the very easy on the eye ladies and their nakedness i would probably have fallen asleep. there is a bit of gore but it's never more than some animal guts placed on the stomach of the victims. the zombie makeup on the other hand looks great and his foot long penis that he uses to rape his victims with is kind of funny at times. there is also a half decent scene where the killer falls in love with a sex doll. the doll with the chipmunks voice is the stupidest thing i have ever seen in a film. it is just a plastic toy on a fishing line.  the ending is extremely bad. you would expect the killer to put up much more of a fight than he does. god knows how they made enough money to make a sequel.   4/10",0
"such is the dilemma(above) that debbie must face at the close of this sam sherman production naughty stewardesses. debbie has just hit town, become a stewardess, slept with an elderly rich man(who she describes is in his 50's but obviously hit that mark a decade or two ago), shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just met, and then is the central element to a kidnapping/extortion plot. through it all and amidst all that emotional upheaval and soul-searching, what in heaven's name will debbie do? well, i cannot give it away completely but don't expect any real epiphany here. let's face it. naughty stewardesses is just what it wants to be(at least two-thirds through): a soft core porn film with lots of topless women and a funny in that kitchy 70's way film. there is no grand art here. the movie was designed to make money and exploit a growing trend at the time to put nymphomaniacal stewardesses in films so that the audience could live out vicariously their voyeuristic tastes. by todays standards, the film is pretty tame. what this film does do wrong is try to be some kind of statement film at the end. c'mon, anyone here believing that little diatribe by debbie while on the beach contemplating life. she would spend more time picking out which halter top she will wear that day then do that. and what about the ridiculous plot to steal 50 grand? it didn't make sense to me so how on earth did these characters ""dig"" it? anyone buying cal as a member of the plo(something like that) or even as a director for hardcore pornography? he would be luck to get work at seven eleven! this is, as another reviewer noted, more of a sam sherman piece then and al adamson piece. you can tell when al is in complete charge. there is virtually no budget and the film doesn't look nearly as polished as this. adamson does a decent job directing this time and i have to give sherman credit to a degree. while this film is bad just for what it was meant to be, it has a certain style to it. i liked the opening credits with the animation and photographs. i even liked the music of sparrow. ""silver heels"" was a somewhat catchy tune. the movie doesn't look cheap really at all. compare that to any of al's horror films. as for the cast, yes, bob livingston is a bit old for the lead, but some examination went into his character and the obvious thread that young women are attracted to men with money was explored as well. i had major problems with robert smedley who was just plain awful in his role. the girls have all got great sets, so what else was required of them huh? naughty stewardesses is relatively harmless exploitation film from the 70's and will serve as a living time capsule for certain aspects of life during that decade. by the way, did i mention it is a pretty bad picture?",0

"i liked the movie, first of all because it told an interesting story, but the story as told in the movie felt like it was condensed from a much-longer story. since the book is over 400 pages, that makes sense. it spans a time period from the 1920s to the 1970s, in a fictional south american country, also a lot to fit into the time available. i think it would have been much better as a six-hour mini-series than it turned out as a 140-minute movie.  even though it's rushed, the story doesn't skip so much that it gets confusing. what is told is told fairly well. one fault is that clara's supernatural powers appear inconsistently; either they should have appeared more evenly through the course of the movie, or they should have been left out. two more faults (which could be spoilers): esteban's eventual return to goodness happens somewhat too suddenly, and ferula's curse seems to wear off, even though the tone of the story suggests that it should endure forever.  the acting is excellent. glenn close, as the tormented spinster ferula, is outstanding. jeremy irons, as the brutal self-made rich man, is also excellent. meryl streep, as the main character clara, is great, although she's often even better than she was in this movie. there were many well-performed smaller roles too. the biggest fault is that the movie seemed to lack a dialect coach; each actor seemed to speak in a different sort of accent.",1

"hines and goforth, the perpetrators of this crime, begin on the wrong foot first step, by assuming that wells wrote gothic horror and that all of his lines are meant to be taken seriously. that simply isn't true. wells was very much an inheritor of the enlightenment, and his main concern was that victorian self-satisfaction might leave the british unprepared for the world the new technology could produce - both the good and the bad.  two terrible consequences follow - the protagonist is portrayed as a wimpy screamer (i was reminded of fay wray in the original king kong), rather than a man struggling to live out the ironies of an unbelievable catastrophe; and the dialog reeks of 'victorianisms' uttered seriously that welles clearly meant to be taken tongue in cheek.  all of this looks suspiciously like ed wood with an enormous budget to waste on cgi effects - which by the way are so poorly accomplished, the warner bros. cartoon factory of the 1940s could have done a better job. (gobs of spattered blood looked like red balloons, i expected them to float away any minute.) think the yellow submarine as done by the old ec comics.  worse yet is the loss of theme, which robs the film of any reason to exist. although the makers of this film return the story to its victorian era, they utterly miss the uncanny way wells' story predicted many of the horrors of the first world war - a fact not unnoticed by wells himself, who, after the war, reworked the theme in the shape of things to come.  without any theme, all we have here are a lot of people running around getting blasted into cartoon balloons, when they're not trying out for a high school production of a drunken student's rewrite of macbeth.  really, this is the worst, most senseless piece of drivel i have suffered through since a friend talked me into seeing the eastern european cartoon ""fantastic planet"" thirty years ago. that film was so pretentiously dull, my friend and i and two total strangers gave up ridiculing it about half-way through, and sat near the screen playing cards, using the movie as light by which to see the cards - its only usefulness, as far as any of us could tell.  but i already have electric lighting in my apartment, so i didn't need this put-down of wells for anything.  do not avoid this film - steal every copy you can (don't pay a cent) and burn each and every one of them. god in his wisdom created us just for this purpose.",0

"it is like what the title of this thread say. only impression i got from that movie is that marlee matlin's character was always angry, so cynical, and so pathetic. her character's first date with william hurt's character where they were dancing were dumb. all in all, i've tried to finish watching the movie four times, and of all four times i fell asleep. i would keep watching that movie with one intention... to beat my problem with insomnia, because all it do is to put me to sleep. sweet dream.",0
"domestic import was a great movie. i laughed the whole time. it was funny on so many levels from the crazy outfits to the hilarious situations. the acting was great. alla korot, larry dorf, howard hesseman, and all the others did an awesome job. because it is an independent film written by a first-time writer, it doesn't have the clichés that are expected of other comedies, which was such a relief. it was a unique and interesting and you fall in love with the characters and the heart-warming story. i heard it was based on a true story? if so, then that is hilarious (and amazing!). i highly recommend this movie.",1
"i *loved* the original scary movie. i'm a huge fan of parody- it is my favorite form of humor. it is sometimes regarded as the most intelligent form of humor. the wayans boys seemed to grasp that concept perfectly in the original film, then temporarily forgot it when making the sequel. i think the wayans' are a family of comical geniuses. alas, even geniuses make mistakes.  the movie begins with promise. i liked ""the exorcist"" parody, especially the ""come on out, ma"" gag. now, that's wayans-quality material. but, other than that, i can only think of two other times i laughed: 1) when tori spelling is seduced in the middle of the night by a spirit, then becomes clingy and starts talking about marriage with him. meanwhile, he's saying, ""it was just a booty call!!"" that was kinda funny. 2) the ""save the last dance"" parody where the cindy character inadvertently beats up a girl while practicing her new moves. but even the short-lived giggles are no match for the side-splitting laughs of the first scary movie.  the rest of the movie is pure trash, filled with cheap gross-out gags. jokes from the first movie which were subtle or implied are magnified and overdone. for example, in scary movie i, several innuendos are made to imply that the character ray is gay. this was hilarious. but, in scary movie ii, the whole penis-strangulation scene with ray under the bed was mind-numbing and incredibly unfunny. this is the pattern of the whole film. shock humor *alone* doesn't take a movie very far. this was a trend in 2000 and 2001, unfortunately.   as much as it pains me to rate a wayans movie so low, i have to give this one a 2 out of 10.",0
"this movie is a terrible waste of time. although it is only an hour and a half long it feels somewhere close to 4. i have never seen a movie move so slowly and so without a purpose. this is also a ""horror"" film that takes place a lot of the time during daylight. my friend and i laughed an insane amount of times when we were probably supposed to be scared.  the only thing we want to know is why such a terrible movie was released in so many countries. it cannot be that high in demand.   the supermodel nicole petty should stick to modeling because although she is beautiful she lost her accent so many times in this movie, half of the time she is british and half the time she is american.",0
"i'm never much for classic films. movies like patton, going my way, how green was my valley, the godfather, casablanca, annie hall, gone with the wind, lawrence of arabia, and citizen kane bore me. however, i would much rather watch any one of those films 3,469 times while being tied up on a chair than watch an american in paris once in the most luxurious suite ever. if i did the latter, i'd probably be sleeping the entire time.  the color art direction and the music didn't interest me, gershwin or non-gershwin. the dancing and the singing could help an insomniac fall to sleep. the dialogue doesn't match up to singin' in the rain. basically, this movie is boring. the only other film that i fell asleep while watching was butch cassidy and the sundance kid. but you can't blame me. i only slept 5 minutes the night before.  1 star/10 (too bad we can't give zeroes.)",0
"dudley moore is fantastic in this largley unknown classic. this film is very witty film that relies hugely on the actors talent. without dudley moore, john gielgud, liza minnelli, and a few others, this film could have been a disaster. it is not always well shot and at times has some very corny music that tries to force a mood (the ""psycho""-like music at the wedding fight), but the acting overcomes it. the character arthur is hilarious, with his drunken comments. but he develops well into a more mature, well rounded character as he learns to live by his own free will. the end is fairly corny, though. i wont give it away, but it could be improved. worth seeing many times.",1
"this movie is yet another in the long line of no budget, no effort, no talent movies shot on video and given a slick cover to dupe unsuspecting renters at the video store.  if you want to know what watching this movie is like, grab a video camera and some red food dye and film yourself and your friends wandering around the neighborhood at night growling and ""attacking"" people. congratulations, you've just made ""hood of the living dead""! now see if a distribution company will buy it from you.  i have seen some low budget, shot on video films that displayed talent from the filmmakers and actors or at the very least effort, but this has neither. avoid unless you are a true masochist or are amused by poorly made horror movies.",0
"there is absolutely no reason to waste your time with this ""film"". the original said it all and still holds up. either read the book or do some research about the story, and you'll realize this remake is ludicrous. eric roberts as perry smith? his sister could have done a better job! having been to holcomb & edgerton, ks where the story takes place, the sets and locations looked nothing like kansas. the original is riveting, from the location filming to the use of the actual participants, weapons and victims belongings. unforgettable performances by scott wilson and robert blake. soundtrack by quincy jones and cinematography by conrad hall...the original is available on dvd in widescreen now. let this turkey die a quick death.",0

"as you can guess by my rating and my title of this review that i don't like johnny test. now i think i know what people are going to say, "" how do you know how bad it is? have you ever watched it?"", i did watch this show a couple times because i am studying film and animation and this just doesn't hold a candle to my standards.  i want to first talk about the animation because it is one of the most confusing things i have ever seen. like the first two seasons or only first season had hand drawn animation. i thought it was a nice show to look at when it was hand drawn but then it switched to flash animation and the quality went down by a huge amount.  so that is one strike in my eyes but lets look at the story of the show. it tries way too hard to be like dexter's lab but there are differences because instead of one red headed scientist there is two and they are both female. there is a talking dog(why?), and the parents attitudes are switched somewhat. i have others but i don't think i can write them here ( i don't mean cursing but i mean i don't know if there is a limit for words.). everything else though is spot on, even a deedee character johnny himself. it just tries so hard to be dexter but it just seems to me like a heartless knockoff.  lastly i want to talk about the jokes. remember in dexters lab some of the jokes involved yelling? yes, yelling can be good for a joke or two but dexter's lab also had sly remarks that made me have to go back and check to get the joke. johnny test just forgets all that and just yells 50% of the time and stops the music whenever a stupid joke or one liner appears. that isn't comedy, thats stupid comedy (i know what some people are thinking. isn't three stooges stupid comedy? watch that and johnny test back to back and you laugh more at the first option.). sometimes the jokes are based on bizarre situations which, like chowder, makes me mad. i have a rule for cartoons and comedies all together: to much bizarre doesn't equal comedy, it makes you just think ""what am i watching?"".  so it strikes out on all accounts. don't watch this show if you have any respect for comedy in anyway, shape, or form.",0
"this cannon movie tale is the worst of the lot, and is positive proof that a five minute fable does not a full-length film make. poor sid caesar as the vain emperor, is made to look so stupid, it's hard to watch him. as the sly tailor, robert morse hasn't an ounce of charm. neither does his hapless nephew (jason carter) the ""songs"" are dreadful and only slow what there is of the plot down. the direction is practically nonexistent, and the supporting characters add very little. lysette anthony is pretty as the emperor's daughter, but her voice has obviously been dubbed for some reason, a fate shared by many of the minor players. and the film crawls at a snails pace. hans christian andersen must have been turning somersaults in his grave when this appeared. it can honestly be said, at least of this movie tale, it's no surprise that it went straight to video oblivion.",0
"before seeing this movie, i was expecting a fictional drama based loosely on ideas from the book; instead, it's the book, interrupted with dramatic scenes illustrating the different ""illnesses."" that didn't bother me much, but it hindered my enjoyment of the film. one story or even two or three long stories with excerpts from the book interspersed through the movie would have been preferable, in my opinion. if you're going to base a movie on a psychology text, you've got to find a more interesting (and preferably accurate) text than this one. the film drags during parts where it's little more than a video encyclopedia of 19th century sexual psychology and would be utterly intolerable if it weren't sexual in nature (because ""sex = interesting"" for most of us, even me). luckily, there are several stories with actual character development that pull us in.  but, disappointingly, krafft-ebing's theories of sexuality went unchallenged, for the most part. i was hoping it would use stories to show how the imperfections of his archaic view of psychology which is still held by many to this day.  so, in the end, what do you have? a detailed catalog of a few fetishes and orientations, with some mildly interesting stories showing the trials and tribulations of a few ""sexual deviants"" before they are cured. for most of the film, the film moves with the crawling speed (and mood) of a wake. and, as an obviously low budget film, the cinematography and acting are not exactly top tier. although i *was* pleased with the music, costume and interior design.  i felt this film's subject was right up my alley, and i still feel it's a below average film. it deserves a 3/10; a 4/10 if i were feeling extremely generous. i can't imagine anyone enjoying this if they didn't already have an interest in sexual fetishism.",0
"writer/director/co-star adam jones is headed for great things. that is the thought i had after seeing his feature film ""cross eyed"". rarely does an independent film leave me feeling as good as his did. cleverly written and masterfully directed, ""cross eyed"" keeps you involved from beginning to end. adam jones may not be a well known name yet, but he will be. if this movie had one or two ""named actors"" it would be a box office sensation. i think it still has a chance to get seen by a main stream audience if just one film distributor takes the time to work this movie. regardless of where it ends up, if you get a chance to see it you won't be disappointed.",1
"pleasant, diverting and charming. the best part is the swing numbers, especially the rendition of my buddy, partial though it may have been. the acting was a bit over the top in areas but the mood set by wilder is so pleasant it is hard not to enjoy this film.",1
"highly implausible, unbelievable, and incoherent spanish production about...well, let me see just how close i can get to it. the film opens with a woman having one of her cat's killed by a young girl. she then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation. he calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this. what relevance this plays out to is anybody's guess at the film's end, because the guy, a swarthy photographer, spies a beautiful patty shepard, queen of spanish horror films it seems, taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture, ask her out to lunch, and then to his assignment to witches mountain - for reasons again we are never privy to. before they go, patty must stop by the house and loud, ""eerie"" chanting echoes in our hero's ears. again, this is never explained. the film goes on with these two stopping at an inn, going on to the mountain, and finally realizing why the mountain is called witches mountain. you know, there are several aspects to this film which make it better than a bad film. it has some atmosphere, some of the character actors are really quite good(especially the deaf innkeeper and the old woman), the leads are at least adequate, and the climax - though it makes absolutely no sense at all - is well-choreographed(literally) with the witches in white brassieres and long black hair. it just doesn't make any sense though, and that is a huge detractor to me. i could watch the film another ten times and still not know more now than i did after the first viewing. that is a major problem. the witches mountain is a curious film from the long line of cheap, atmospheric european horror films that blanketed that decade. if you can get more out of it than me, better power to you.",0
"the cat and mouse are involved in the usual chases when jerry dives into a bottle of invisible ink and discovers that it makes him vanish. instead of seizing the opportunity to go spy on a girl mouse changing room or something, he uses his new-found invisibility to torment tom. and it's pretty funny and quite inventive despite being a somewhat one-joke cartoon. and the action never leaves the interior of the house, which is usually the trait of below average t&j shorts. still worth a 7/10.  however, i'm not sure how an invisible mouse can cast a shadow on the wall, it defies physics and the very nature of being invisible itself.",1
"wow, after trashing the disk of timo roses ""rout city"" after about 15 minutes (south park is about more than meaningless cursing... i guess some people just don't get it) i was interested in this movie. i read quite some positive stuff and the packaging and look of the movie seemed far from the total trash i expected after ""rout city"".  surprise: the movie isn't total trash but the problem seems to be exactly that. timo rose tries to walk in the footsteps of german horror/splatter cinema like olaf ittenbach and the likes. that means ""barricade"" is in parts extremely gory and detailed. the gore fx are not really believable but ok, the acting is ok but in some cases plain sucks. the hillbilly chick in the opening sequence is ridiculous and doesn't get better till she's shot.  so what is the problem... the movie is gory, has a typical german underground vibe (including the classic booby shots in blood), ok fx and a modern feel to it like the packaging already promised?!   1. the script is total bs. you get a typical hillbilly/lost in the woods story with some guys+gal camping out and meeting a degenerated hillbilly family. everything is just leading towards the torture/mutilation scenes and seems unbelievably random and pointless. this is the first thing that makes ""barricade"" half-hearted.  2. random is also the perfect description for a lot of the camera work (i liked the repetitive cut to the tweezers in the extended booby torture scene... either they had no material or the editor works in a hardware store). even worse the editing... sure, its modern and far better than a lot of other movies in the genre but its random. you got an overuse of that typical exposure effect everywhere and with no meaning ... its just there... all the time. then there's some grainy/noisy film look which also is just thrown in here and there for the sake of it, i don't get the meaning.  3. like the fore-mentioned effects there is a lot of repetitive stuff in here. for example most of the kills are edited with multiple repetitions of stabbing and punching. its ok once but here its annoying and fake, especially towards the end. annoying also attributes the ""music"" which is permanently used without any change in the background. it doesn't take long until it makes the movie hardly bearable.  4. from all this comes the biggest problem of this movie (and many others in my opinion). if you make a splatter movie with trashy feel its pretty idiotic to polish it with special fx and new school editing. it looks like they take it way too serious. its no fun because the decent gore fx are plain wasted in this context. and where the classic gore fx are ok the computer fx in scenes like the stabbing in the mouth or the gunshots in the ending look rather silly(and 3d splatter mostly sucks to me even in movies with a budget and decent 3d artists).  i often wondered if the time of serious splatter movies is over and ""barricade"" is just another example it might be time to put it in the tomb. its no fun, has no character and is too trashy for its look. the script is a cheap try on ""wrong turn"" and ""tcm"" leading absolutely nowhere. you can take that literally... the ending is just there and as random as many other things here (""i love you"" in a splatter flick... come on!!). ""barricade"" tries to incorporate a lot and fails...you can sure fast-forward through this movie for some extensive disembowelment, acid face melting,nipple pinching and classic friday the 13th style stabbing of a couple while fingering in a tent (bloody boobies hooray!). but its really hard to get through this. total failure especially because you can see it could have been something.",0
"i think that this movie was reasonbaly good. it's kinda weird that now the olsen twins are 13 and have boyfriends and all. i enjoyed them alot when they were little kids on full house. anyway, the casting was good and the movie was somewhat funny. i kind of got mixed up between all the switching places and their names. it's just kind of an older version of it takes two.",1
"this movie kept me constantly entertained. in comparing this to serial mom, mr. waters has gone back to his grittier side. this is not nearly as polished.  there is a dark side here. a message about how success and fame changes a person -- but more importantly how it changes the people around you.  there is not a false moment in this film.  the characters are somewhat cartoonish... but i want to believe that is what mr. waters is trying to achieve.  it is fascinating to watch how mr. waters has evolved... this is truly his finest work.",1
"if you weren't there, then unfortunately this movie will be beyond compassion for you. which as i say is a shame because although some of the acting is amateurish, it is meant to be for realism. let's face it--in real life, we don't say things in an exacting or perfect way, even when we mean to. in this sense, it works. this, however, does not apply to our ""known"" actors in this film, notably jodie foster (born a natural). the fact that the other 3 girls are not accomplished only adds to the story--jodie plays the glue that struggles to keep their friendship close, even with the obvious feeling of fatality. meaning that no matter how close friends are, eventually there are some people that just fade away, no matter how you try.  and therein is the core of the movie. it's not about partying, it's not about sexuality, but about these 4 girls and their final time as still young girls before they have to go the world alone.  if you have ever had a friendship like that in your life, you will feel this movie--it will mean a lot to you, no matter what era it is set in, or what era you grew up in. we all knew these girls in school, or at the very least knew of them. we all knew the frustrated virgin, half wanting to hold onto childhood and half wanting desperately to grow up and thinking that will do it for her. we all knew the boy-crazy one, the fashion plate whose vanity hides her fear of the world, her fear of acceptance. we all knew the party girl, the one they whispered about, with tales of not only her sad home life but of her notorious exploits. and we all knew the ""mother figure"", the one a little more real, a little more grounded, a little more sad because she knew what would happen. maybe you were one of those girls. maybe, like me, you had been each one at one time or another...  this film really captures that fragile time in life when want, needs, pressures, womanhood, childhood, the world and loneliness are all embodied in each female's head, each factor on the precipice. which aspect do you hang on to? what do you toss over the edge, no matter how you may want to hold on? and how painful is goodbye to everything you've known? that's what this movie is--steps into womanhood while clinging onto childhood, and how damn tough it is to keep walking. if you were there, you know...and love this film, as i do. aching and tenderly done. a fine piece of captured femininity.",1
"'ninteen eighty-four' is a film about a futuristic society in which the government controls everything and no one can be trusted. it is a very dark film, and it is one that will not make you feel good about yourself. it is about a romance taking place in this society and the betrayal of the lovers and about human nature being self-centred. the film has some very good ideas and is done well in portraying this society with the dark tones in colours (contrasting with happiness and bright colours in the dreams) and a general feeling of loneliness through objects and people and places. however, despite the film's cleverness at portraying this idea, the film was very slow and did not seem to quite get the idea across. it seemed to spend too much time being clever rather than telling a story.",0

"probably one of the most boriest slasher movies ever, badly acted and badly written.  the plot five students staying behind during the holidays closing down a dorm, but somebody has designs on them and starts killing them off one by one, the main suspect is the creepy groundskeeper john hemmitt played by woody roll, or could it be one of the five characters.  acting not that bad not that great either apart from daphne zungia who dies way too quickly and should have been the main heroine, and the rest well quite dull although laura lapinski the main heroine sometimes has her charm and you do feel sorry for her in the end.  the kills can't really see why they banned this, the kills look fake mostly, one guy has his hand sliced in half in the beginning which looks really fake, but the others are quite nasty like one girl gets her head run over by a car, one girl gets boiled alive and another gets burned alive.  overall not really a great slasher could have been a lot better",0
"i figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like chris rock, and then see chris rock react to people's reactions. instead you just see chris rock being himself and people not understanding him. there are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick. this should have been a lot better.",0
"vodka lemon is a charming, yet extremely uneven arminian film that will delight some and bore others. though reasonably well-crafted, the film lacks any real ""zing"", relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art-house viewer. the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance, unfortunately, they deserve a film worthy of their genius. too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama, vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled. you may laugh, but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides. a noble effort, ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion.",0
"first off...with names like fred olen ray, brinke stevens and jan-michael vincent, plus distributors like ""rhino"" and ""troma"" on the video box, you know what you're getting into with this one. b movie mania! if you're actually expecting to see a thriller ""based on edgar allan poe,"" then forget it and head straight for the excellent series of roger corman 60s poe films. this is pure, unadulterated sleaze (with just a pedestrian attempt at a plot similar to ""the premature burial""), complete with lots of r-rated, ready-for-video sex and nudity. however, it's certainly entertaining and fun in a slipshod kind of way...  brinke (who has three nude scenes in the first 30 minutes) plays rich, traumatized, insomniac housewife victoria monroe, whose fear of being prematurely entombed stems from her belief that the same fate befell her father (hoke howell). her worthless husband terry (jay richardson) has racked up some serious gambling debt (owed to a gangster played by robert quarry) and, with help from his kinky, blonde, european-accented sexpot secretary lisa (delia sheppard) plots to do away with brinke for her money. name-value actress karen black drops in briefly wearing a blonde wig as a hypnotist (she's way too talented to be playing an insignificant role like this), 50s sci-fi/horror star robert clarke plays a doctor and family friend and michael berryman shows up for a decent nightmare sequence performing an autopsy on a still-living vicki. jan-michael vincent mostly sits outside a house in his car making goo-goo eyes as brinke enters and exits the home.  the kill-a-spouse-for-the-inheritance plot has been done a million times before, the ending is an unintentional laugh riot (concluding with a direct rip-off of the zuni fetish doll segment in trilogy of terror) and whoever created the awful stabbed face and decapitated head fx for this release needs to sharpen up on their skills a bit. brinke does a decent job making her character somewhat sympathetic, but the biggest surprise of all is how good former penthouse pet delia sheppard is in her role. she stole every scene she was in and easily gave the standout performance here.",0
"i was not impressed about this film especially for the fact that i went to the cinema with my family in good faith to see a film which was certificate rated 12a here in the uk. to my dismay, this film was full of embarrassing sexual jokes. (which is not a problem to me as an adult, but not good for watching with children). this film at times was very crude at times with fart jokes, getting hit in the groin etc... and for the most part of the film not very funny.  the premise of the film is that calvin sims who is a 2inch midget, gets out of jail and steals a giant sized diamond but is then forced to put it in a womens handbag. so the rest of the movie sees him passing himself off as an abandoned baby, getting into this womens house so he can get this diamond back.  up until now, i have enjoyed most of the output from the wayans brothers - but this film is certainly taking the biscuit.  a bit of good advice - wait till it comes on tv or cable",0
"i found this show really late at night, and gave it a try. it's a refreshing change from the other kinds of things shown late at night, if you catch my drift. its simplicity of values and sweetness of hearts helps remind me of the way friendships were as children. it's something i indulge in whenever i find it on (which is rare, maybe i should actually check the listings! haha)..... and the tension between joe and nick is so cute. like any good chick flick, you really get emotionally involved in the characters. good ol' louisa may alcott still inspiring good stories :) so apparently i must complete 10 lines of text in order for my opinion to be valid, so i guess i'll tell you a bit more. the kids are played by talented actors and actresses, and the settings are lovely and nature-filled -- another thing you don't see much on television. i hope everyone gives it a shot. i recognize and am fully aware that it's sappy, but it's good heart. like i said before, it's refreshing.",1

this is the worst movie i have ever seen. i was deceived into thinking it might be good because a couple of my favorite actors are in it. now i want to punch jason schwartzman in the face for taking this role. i was physically ill after watching this film. i really don't understand hollywood sometimes. there are so many people trying to break in that i'm sure you can skim off the top and get the very best. that way the worst movie you make is equivalent to ferris beullar instead of this sludge. the gags like the hair doll and blatantly ripping off jeans commercials added to the humorlessness of the film. glad i avoided this film and watched it on tv. this proves that you should avoid january releases at all cost.,0
"if ashanti had been a serious attempt at a film about the institution of slavery, still prevalent in third world countries the film might have been better received. instead it turns into a star studded disaster of a movie where the stars came in, said their lines, and picked up their paychecks without much conviction.  michael caine and his wife beverly johnson work for the united nations world health organization and are busy doing their humanitarian thing in east africa. along comes peter ustinov who can barely summon enough ham in him to make a go of the part as a moslem slave dealer. as johnson is black he grabs her anyway along with a lot of children and a few adults as well.  of course caine doesn't take kindly to the kidnapping and the rest of the film is spent in a rescue attempt. the rest of the cast has such folks as william holden, rex harrison, omar sharif and indian film star kebir bedi in parts and looking so incredibly bored with the whole thing.  usually in something like this talented people like those mentioned above will just overact outrageously and feast on a diet of scenery. but ashanti doesn't even have that going for it.  what an incredible waste of time. the aroma of tax write off is permeating the air.",0
"much has been written about purple rain, the apparent ""quin-essential"" musician bio movie, however i'm here to tell you that the movie does not deserve it's high praise.  first of all let's get one thing straight prince is a great musician and music is the one area where purple rain excels. even the score is mesmerising, and if this was shot purely as a concert film it would be a great experience unfortunately it's not and as such the movie has some problems.  first of all is the horrendous acting/writing, prince's character ""the kid"" is supposed to come off as some type of mysterious loner of few words unfortunately this just comes off as corny and incensere. a good loner character should at least have some talkative moments, unfortunately prince's character rarely has over a few words of dialog in the film and it's hard to believe that he'd get the girl this way. everything just seems a little off here, which is a shame because you can tell this is a character that's terribly conflicted and lives a very complicated live, but we aren't ever allowed to get inside of it.  a surprising aspect of this film is just how much of this takes place in concert. prince and morris's lives seemingly take a back seat to the performances here, which i guess makes sense from a business perspective, but it's exhausting to have a 2 hour movie where seemingly half of it takes place on stage, especially when the character's back stories get pushed aside for it.  so to sum it up: this isn't a very good movie.",0
"why, oh, why won't they learn? when you've got a nice, juicy exploitation gimmick, use it! don't go messing around trying to get all deep and thoughtful; you're only gonna wind up looking foolish.  christmas evil is the story of harry stadling, who saw a little bit too much of mommy kissing (daddy-dressed-as-)santa claus back when he was a kid. so, of course, harry grows up obsessed with christmas, and finally, when his disillusionment becomes too great, he flips out, dresses as santa, and wanders the city giving out toys to good little children, and viciously killing anyone he deems naughty.  simple enough, and not a bad place to start. (after all, how many other holiday-themed horror flicks use the same schtick?) unfortunately, this film wants to be more ""santa, portrait of a serial killer"" than ""silent night, deadly night"". two-thirds of the film are spent documenting harry's slow but inevitable breakdown, when i would have been willing to buy the premise by the time the opening titles were rolling. you know a slasher film is in trouble when you find yourself urging the killer to just get on with it already.  perhaps harry's descent into madness could have been compelling in the hands of a competent director, but alas, we've got some guy named lewis jackson. apparently, this is his only film, and it shows. the action jumps giddily from scene to scene, without establishing shots or clear views of the actors to let us know where we are and who we are seeing.  even once the film gets rolling, we're still treated to heaping helpings of harry's self-pity, insecurity, and neurotic behavior. more depressing than frightening, christmas evil is one to avoid.",0
"i really enjoyed this movie.i was fifteen when this movie came out and i could relate. this will be a movie i would show my kids to let them know, the feelings they are having are normal. it is funny to see how we could be so devestated by things at such a young age..who knew that we would bounce back....again and again....great movie!!!!",1
"this is a very well-made film, meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving - for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife. the plot is convincingly worked out and exciting. the gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero. it's made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld characters.  a couple of slight reservations: i found the ending slightly one-sided as it celebrates the hero's successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system, which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up to that point. also i found the lead female character somewhat weak: little more than a catalyst for the salvation of the hero, all she seems to do is weep and swoon as the tough guys battle it out.",1
"matt saunders (luke wilson) thinks he has found the perfect woman in jenny johnson (uma thurman), who seems like a quiet but pretty woman, though he soon learns that she's needy and possessive, oh, and she's also the superhero g-girl, though you wouldn't know it from the things she does to matt after he freaks out and breaks up with her.  a promising premise is ruined by a mediocre execution. my super ex-girlfriend is still an enjoyable comedy however it relies too much on cheap sex jokes and it ends up being a forgettable experience. what went wrong? the cast and the director could not overcome the weakness of the script and i didn't like the way they played it out. i was expecting the guy to be a jerk and it could have been a female fantasy revenge film. however, they made the guy likable and they made the superhero a psycho. it just wasn't very fresh and after about forty minutes, the film wore out it's welcome. sure, there were a few funny lines however the weak middle and horrible ending kept it from really breaking out.  director ivan reitman has lost his touch. after a successful run in the eighties and early nineties, he started making crap like evolution and father's day. i wouldn't say my super ex-girlfriend is a complete bust but i don't give him credit for any of the quality the movie holds, which isn't too much. don payne did an awful job with the screenplay. the majority of the jokes were lame and most of the supporting characters were just one-note. he also kept reusing a lot of the same jokes making the thing really tedious at times.  a few of the actors were good enough to save the film. uma thurman was great as g-girl and she had many funny lines. luke wilson was a bit pale and not very interesting. i don't think he makes for an appealing leading man and he's better in supporting roles like in the family stone. anna faris was just doing her ""scary movie"" routine and it's getting a little old. she needs a challenge or at least some better scripts. wanda sykes is either hit or miss for me. she was great in monster-in-law and she was bad in clerks 2. here, she is just annoying and doesn't bring anything to the movie. eddie izzard was alright, nothing special. rainn wilson was just annoying and not funny. overall, i was disappointed with the movie. it wasn't awful yet it had so much potential and the final result was just so average. rating 5/10",0
"i really liked zb1. really, i did. i have no problem with extremely low-budget movies, and i have enjoyed movies with worse production values than zb3 (if you can imagine such a thing. check out 'wiseguys vs. zombies,' if you're interested). indeed, i prefer lower budget zombie films, because i am suspicious that hollywood directors do not understand what zombies are 'about.'  but zb3 was just so bad. it was retarded. i don't want to bother being dignified in my criticism. i want my 90 minutes back, etc. except that it really only took ~80 minutes, because partway through i put it into 1.4x fast forward.  okay, here's some criticism.  1. the pacing was terrible. everyone talked in monologues. even when someone just had a single line, the camera work and the editing and the insertion of a bunch of f-bombs into every sentence made the line feel like a monologue. at first i was excited about the 90 minute running time compared to zb1's 70 minutes, but there were actually fewer 'events' in zb3. it's all talking.  2. the gore effects got stupider. just glop rubbed around on people's tummies.  3. despite the epic exposition, there really wasn't a plot. and the exposition is indeed epic! i won't spoil it, if you're going to watch it. (don't watch it.) but then, it's just a bunch of lame characters walking around and bickering for ~80 minutes. or fewer, if you so choose.",0
"an insomniac's nightmare was an incredibly interesting, well-made film. i loved the way it just throws you into the main character's subconscious without coddling the viewer...the acting was top notch - honestly, i would watch dominic monaghan read the phone book! - but everyone else, especially the young girl, was great as well. i was very impressed by the look of the film, too. usually, ""independent films"" have a grainy, i-shot-this-on-my-camcorder look to them, but this director knows what she's doing. the lighting, the cinematography...quality work. i'm looking forward to a feature-length work from tess nanavati!",1
"kim basinger stars as della, a desperate housewife with a somewhat abusive husband, who gets into trouble while she's out at the local mall doing some last minute christmas shopping. after placing a hastily scrawled hateful note on a piece of paper and sticking said paper in the windshield of a car that took up two parking spaces, she finds out the owners of the car are the rainbow coilition of villains comprising of a white guy, a mexican, a chinese guy & a black. they confront her about the note, cap a helpless security guard, and the chase is on. during the course of the film della will go for hunted to hunter as she unleashes her inner bronson.  i found this to be a somewhat tense little thriller. the acting was good enough (except for a few scenes, the ""why god why"" bit was cringe worthy in it's badness though) it comes undone a bit due to the sheer fact that the villains della chases from/after are mind-numbingly stupid. if they hadn't had the intellect of any given ""home alone"" baddie, perhaps their eventual defeat would be something to savor instead of the meh reaction it evokes. the unbelievability factor i'm willing to overlook as both the director & one of the producers had part in bringing ""shoot em up"" to the screen (a film which while throwing credibility out the window was immensely fun). this film while never attaining the heights of that film, was good in it's own rights.  my grade: c-   anchor bay dvd extras: commentary with writer/director susan montford and producer don murphy; a 25 and a half minute 'making-of'; a trailer & two tv spots for this film; and trailer for lower learning",0
"inspector gadget (1999) **  starring: matthew broderick, rupert everett, joely fisher, andy dick, dabney coleman director: david kellogg 80 minutes rated pg  by blake french:  disney's new film, ""inspector gadget"" is about a cop named john who survives a major accident and is saved by a state of the art experimental operation that turns him into a robotic machine-like agent who has tools and contraptions of all sorts built into his body at his use when he says ""go go,"" only to be called inspector gadget!  the actual movie's structure is much like the body formation of inspector gadget himself. it is noisy, fragmented, energetic and consist of a bunch of half hearted contraptions thrown together to make something that doesn't have much in common with anything else present. the film is basically a series of zany action sequences that are kind of pasted together with characters and an uneven story that only kids between the ages of 6-9 would enjoy.  the cop who is dramatically reinvented is played by matthew broderick, who, until ""inspector gadget,"" was on a success spree with movies like ""election."" his character becomes inspector gadget after an encounter with the film's heavy handed villain named claw. he is played by rupert everett, who has already experienced catastrophe this year with the dreadful ""william shakespeare's a midsummer nights dream.""  there is a romantic subplot in this movie as well as ample amounts of scenes involving inspector gadget's wacky body parts and mechanism elements. it has gadget and claw drooling over the attractive character brenda, played by joely fisher, for both her looks and her knowledge of a specific invention made by her late father, who was earlier killed by claw. competition evolves into fight scenes and a reason for many happenings in the film. also a major character is the gadget mobil, a life like automobile that is devised for inspector gadget himself. it is voiced by d.l. hughly from the sitcom comedy ""the hughly's.""  ""inspector gadget"" is a movie that i found quite bad. i know, i am not exactly a target audience of the filmmakers, but even my ten year old relative found the film to his disliking. the movie is full of distinct flaws and obvious problems. i never found myself caring about the characters. there is no mood development beyond some neat opening credits, unlike the much worse 1997 film, ""mr. magoo,"" which opened using clips of the original cartoon. is it too much to ask for that same type of thing in this comedy-which is seldom funny and hardly ever convincing. the overall production design is nothing but a mess of incomplete sight gags and consists of one joke: inspector gadget's bumbling goofiness.  in movies like this the audience lusts for boundaries-something to help make out what can happen and what can not. in ""inspector gadget"" there are no such boundaries. this is truthfully nothing more than a party time for the actors, who surly had lots of fun. i am reminded of another lacking comedy released a few years ago called ""blankman"" which again, contained lots of props and energy, and the actors certainly had fun time with all the gizmos and props, but it too lacked something needed for every movie: audience participation.  a character that i found being left out a lot is gadgets daughter, who by the end of the movie, i still has not clue of what her name was. she is used only as a plot device-and i question how she was used to further the plot as well. for her presence brings nothing relevant or productive to the film. we never know her reactions to her father's operation or accidents. thus, this is someone who could have been completely left out and would have not affected the movie a bit.  in closing, i'd like to state that ""inspector gadget"" is an awful, insufficient excuse for a children's comedy. and believe it or not, i find myself comparing this film to last years violent and very anti-young audience action picture ""blade."" i am stating once again that i had much rather have a movie where nothing happens than one in which everything happens. ""inspector gadget"" had so much going for it at the same time, it made literally made me dizzy.  ",0
"the first time i saw this film in the theatre at a foreign film festival, i thought it intriguing, fascinating, the sensitive bi-sexual artist. so very european, so very dutch! i recently rented it for a second viewing and could hardly keep from laughing at that overworked theme of the mad writer with a religious-sexual orientation persecution complex. get a grip! this guy is a freeloader, living off of society. i suspect that the real reason he is having these fantasy-nightmares about the ""spiderwoman"" is that his guilt complex is kicking in after year's of ignoring mother's advice about getting into cars (and bed) with strangers! not only is he making outrageous sums of (probably taxfree) loot for making up stories (lying guilt trip) but he is too cheap to pay for a hair cut, hence he hustles the beauty salon owner. then he has the nerve to complain about the bill! but i also suspect the world has changed alot since this film was made. on a serious note it was entertaining to see some of jan de bont's camera work and one of paul verhoeven's earlier films. hmmm, maybe the world hasn't changed so very much after all?",1

"love at the top--the utterly wrongheaded american title for the superb french film ""le mouton enrage"" (which means, i think, the rabid sheep)-- is such an original movie, the fact that it dates back to 1974 seems all the more astounding. this film was far ahead of its time; even by today's highest standards, it accomplishes things that seem rich and new. filmed by the hugely underrated director michel deville, it rather defies description in the way it combines social critique, comedy, mystery, love, sex and satire into one wholly original mix--leaving for the end a major but subtle surprise to render all that has gone before suddenly sad and more understandable. the cast is splendid, ditto the writing and theme. but it's deville's delicious tone, keeping you constantly off-balance but enrapt, that pushes this ""lost"" film to a very high level indeed. (the written interview with the director on the ""special features"" section of the dvd is definitely worth reading if you have the time.)",1

"if you seen rodney dangerfield's previous movies and performances, you'll recognise several of the jokes made in this odd piece of dreck. written like a sitcom, this movie fails to strike any sort of likeable chord throughout, from the self-help doctor played by the aways sexy-as-chopped liver molly shannon to the 'i'm fat, and therefore funny' john linette. the 5 wives themselves are likeable enough, and if this had been done as a pilot for an action-adventure series, it might have worked. instead, it comes off like a male fantasy that's trying hard not to be politically incorrect.",0
"one of the best documentaries released in recent years. some points...  1. hugo chavez was elected venezuela's president in 1998, his support largely coming from the poorer regions of venezuela.  2. in 2002, a coup briefly deposed chavez. at the time, irish filmmakers kim bartley and donnacha o'briain were in caracas, shooting a documentary about chavez for british television. their film deconstructs the coup and its aftermath, and electrifyingly records history unfolding on-the-spot, outside and inside the presidential palace.  3. chavez aimed to free venezuela from the free-market policies imposed on it by the us. though venezuela's oil was already state-owned, it was run for private benefit by executives who chavez wished to replace.  4. despite being the world's fourth largest oil supplier, venezuela remains swamped by poverty, its resources literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations.  5. the documentary begins by portraying chavez's first years as president before the coup. it focuses on his popularity with the poor, and his various policies which proved popular with working class locals (educational plans, distribution of the oil revenue, grass-root democracy etc).  6. chavez was a huge proponent of education, and printed thousands of copies of the venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand it.  7. when chavez came to power, he immediately pledged to redistribute oil profits. this, understandably, made the oil companies nervous.  8. a media-war broke out. the six private tv stations promptly began opposing the state-run tv station. they questioned chavez's motives, sanity and sexual orientation.  9. without media support, the coup would not have been successful. the film makes it clear that coups rely heavily on the media to disseminate information and that news can be easily fabricated.  10. under the guise of ""re-establishing democracy"", the opposition silenced the state-run tv station, dissolved the national electoral board, supreme court, national assembly and took control of the military.  11. moneyed interests, backed by the military elite (encouraged by the us and cia), organised a citizens' march on the presidential palace to effect the coup. snipers shot at chávez supporters, but the private media stations edited footage so it appeared that return fire was aimed at the opposition march that in fact had been safely diverted.  12. police went on a shooting rampage against chavez supporters, further bloodying the streets.  13. chavez, held captive, refused to resign. of course the media/government then lied, saying he had resigned, but chavez's cabinet members communicated the truth to the international community, which eventually got the message back to venezuela by cable tv.  14. the people rose up, pressuring the return of the president they had elected, whom only a referendum could constitutionally replace.  8.9/10 - at a little over an hour long, this doc is far too short. nevertheless, its an engrossing piece of journalism and deals with a form of ""media warfare"" which rarely gets touched upon. makes a great companion piece to ""the battle of algiers"".  worth one viewing.",1

"although the actors do a convincing job playing the losers that parade across the screen, the fact that these characters are impossible to identify with had me looking at my watch a mere 20 minutes into the film (and more than once after that). the plot development is disjointed and slow, the verbal diarrhoea of the main character's only friend is practically insufferable, the base quality of most of the characters actions and the cavalier way in which they are treating is annoying.  it is typical of ventura pons to put forth crass psychologically handicapped characters. however, this faux sociological analysis is a big step down from caricias or caresses, where the characters maltreat and despise each other for well founded reasons that play out during that film. in amor idiota we are forced to follow the meanderings of a truly subnormal intelligence as he stalks a severely depressed and detached woman. supposedly this is due to his own depression but the script doesn't support that. i won't give away the rest of the story just in case there are any masochists out there is he cured through his obsession or is the woman shocked out of her own depression through his unwavering attention? even though i watched the whole thing i wasn't made to care even for a moment about either of them.  if you can sit through all this prejudice, ignorance, betrayal, bad dialogue, flimsy philosophy, etc the camera-work was pretty good and seems to be something inspired by the dogma group. the makeup also seemed to aim at showing these players in a raw and gritty light as it is the worst i've seen cayetana guillen cuervo in any of her movies (while in person she is actually attractive).  i suppose if the idea is that we should be forced to see the lower strata of society so we can be grateful we are not part of it then pons has achieved his objective. the barrage of nearly identical sex scenes was a proper waste of film (if the actors had been filmed but once in blue green clothing the background behind them could have been changed in the special effects studio for a pittance). true that i heard much of the male audience squirm in their seats during this but an objective viewing proves that was not the real aim of those scenes.  save yourselves and watch something else.",0

"there was a great film to be made about steve biko. sadly this wasn't it. denzel washington - never the most flexible of actors - is totally unable to convey the great charisma that biko had. attenborough's big crowd scenes are laughable. the soweto massacre wasn't like this, three neat lines of children ( some doing cartwheels!) marching happily into the guns of the soldiers. with biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce. if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black people's struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family. i'm sure donald woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that biko was important while he wasn't. penelope wilton's accent is pure hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in south africa at all. at all. the wood's family dog gets more lines than the black maid. as the family make their escape one the women i saw the film with - incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large, full cinema - whispered ""this is like the sound of music."" she had a point.  overall this is a film by a well-intentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people's struggle. and really south africa needs well-intentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head.",0

"another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale, la bete (1975) aka the beast tries to imagine (in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way), what actually happened between beauty and the beast? i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie. i would not go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration, longing, fulfillment, or satirical criticizing of the catholic religion. i would not even call it a horror-erotic movie. it's more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it's got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory.  the long (way too long) scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i've ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive...well anatomy, is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti and is hysterical. my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter. the moral of the scene is - beauty can and will defeat the monster. the question is - who is the target audience for the film? for an erotic picture, it is too verbose; for an art movie - it's got too many jaw-dropping scenes of sheer madness and i'd say an abrupt ending. imo, the film creator did not mean for it to be a serious drama. as a parody of art house/horror/erotica, it is funny and certainly original. have a good laugh and try not to look for some deep meaning. this story of the curious beauties and the lustful beasts certainly is not recommended for co-viewing with the children. the opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like ""in the world of animals - mating habits and rituals of horses"".",0

"anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we're about to see can't ever be known and ""this is the whisper [rumor] most often told"" about one of hollywood's most sensational ""mysteries.""  okay. so we're not getting anything new (and e!'s ""mysteries & scandals"" gives you a better foothold on the particular incident...and that's not much of an endorsement). what do we get?  we learn that hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents. no big news there. more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment. it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. but what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled, we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history.  the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun. we're not empathetic with anyone. and the great ""citizen kane"" polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way. in ""the cat's meow"" we're not ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst. as soon as we're told one thing, she's off doing the other.  and are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplain's life? or is he just trying to cockold one of america's most powerful--and apparently moronic--citizens. the film never makes it clear.  what is convincing are the production values. there's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well-known personalities in hollywood history. no one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying.  the performers can't be faulted, although meg tilly goes way past parody here. kirsten dunst never disappoints. she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing. only joanna lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it. one of her first lines is, ""i'm not here!"" and i'm sure she wishes she wasn't.  this isn't on par with bogdanovich's trashy, so-bad-it's-good ""at long last love."" it's perched on attempting something serious, but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it's so full of bitterness towards ""the beast"" named hollywood. this is ""national enquirer"" filmmaking. and it not only soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend, but the audience gets pretty dirty as well.",0
"for the first forty minutes, empire really shapes itself up: it appears to be a strong, confident, and relatively unknown gangster flick. at the time i didn't know why, i thought it was good- but now i do.   one of the main problems with this film is that it is purely and utterly distasteful. i don't mind films with psychos and things, to prove a point- take jackie brown, for example- but they're all so terribly shallow in this, but that is obviously thrown in for entertainment. you literally feel a knot pull in your stomach. another major problem is the protagonist. he is smug, arrogant, yet- ironically enough- not that bad. he doesn't seem tight enough to be a drug-dealing woman killer. the fact is, at the end of the day, this film is completely pretentious. not slick, not clever, just dull, and meaningless- this colossal mess should be avoided at all costs.   * out of ***** (1 out of 5)",0
"96 minutes of this is cruel..and i love the old munster's. yes, the plot is thing; yes the lines are trite; but whoever was at the helm of this was not a fan. there is so much 'intrigue' (and i use that word with great pause) that i wonder if it's an old starsky & hutch episode. i lost count of the number of times i noticed that makeup had missed a spot near the collar. refusing to acknowledge that any time had passed since the mid-60's (ludicrous) the producers simply replace marilyn & eddie with younger actors. why not let them grow and age? the addition of an addam's family style reunion does not add to the flavor of the halloween party.  grandpa & herman fly to transylvania and back in a few hours (preposterous.) sid ceaser is the most, yes the most unbelievable character (i am including the bad robots) since he babbles an unwild combination of gibberish & yiddish but claims to be an ancient arabic ruler. and yes, it looks like the laugh track is missing. in fact, there are several spots where there is dead air, as if the laugh track was to be inserted later. the actors seem to wait on the faux audience. it's not laughable; it's sad. oh, and the best part! yvonne decarlo has a line that just goes to show you how out of touch the writers and producers were. marilyn says something like: ""where could uncle herman and grandpa be? they could have been in an accident. they could have been hit by a car...or a train!"" lily says responds with something like: ""you're uncle herman will be here if he has to drag himself off the train track."" what's amazing about this is: yvonne decarlo's husband was a stuntman in the early 60's and lost a leg and was nearly killed in a train stunt. he never recovered and this financially devastated her family. (check out biography's fantastic review of her life and career) this line could have been easily changed to be more sensitive to her.  if you are a real fan of the munster's then you'll have to rent this mess. it illustrates how some things are better left alone. even with the (nearly) original cast, this is almost as bad as the attempted remake of the show a few years ago.",0
"from a modern sensibility, it's sometimes hard to watch older films. it's annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man. especially such a shallow and inconstant man. he's obviously a player (i wouldn't trust him to stay true to her) who doesn't want to settle down, who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them ""baby"" (ick!). even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him, he only goes to her after he's (supposedly) rejected by another woman and learns that connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. i wanted her to stand up to him, not pathetically chase after him! his sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for me.  apart from that subplot, i did like the movie. how can you not like sailors dancing with each other?! (you can tell they were from san francisco.... ;d) the ""rehearsal"" dance was great, watching ginger rogers purposefully fall in and out of the ""correct steps"" was great. the last dance scene ""face the music"" with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful. and i really enjoyed ""we saw the sea"" (though they did use it a few too many times, as if they realized it was their best song).   anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (imo) - and the songs were ok, but the dancing was worth watching the film for. i wish they could have showed some shots of san francisco since that was were the film was supposedly set.  it's also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what hitler was already doing at that time. i have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land.",1
"since douglas macarthur affected more human livesfor the betterthan any other american not elected president, he deserved a better film biography. not that universal's ""macarthur"" is bad. it's just not all it should have been.  oddly enough, the potential was there. from the very early ""star trek"" episode ""the corbomite maneuver"" (1966) to the recent hbo films ""something the lord made"" (2oo4) and ""warm springs"" (2oo5), director joseph sargent has emerged as one of the most expressively human directors in film, a man capable of subtly shaping the emotional shadings of his actors' performances, and carrying the audience exactly where he wants them to go. the producer, frank mccarthy, also gave us ""patton"" (197o), the legendary jerry goldsmith scored both films, and universal widely touted the fact that the film was ""four years in preparation and production."" yet for all of this, ""macarthur"" is perfectly adequateand not much more than that.  the film begins in early 1942, shortly before the beleaguered general was orderedby president franklin d. roosevelt (dan o'herlihy)to flee the philippines to avoid capture by the japanese. thus, this film omits:   · macarthur's birth in 188o in a frontier barracks in arkansas still subject to attack by native american tribesmenthus establishing that his remarkable life spanned the distance from bows-and-arrows to thermonuclear weapons;   · his graduation from west pointfirst in a class of 95,   · how he joined his famous father, general arthur macarthur (who had earned the medal of honor at missionary ridge in the civil war) on assignments in japan, china and, most importantly, in the philippines;   · his heroic exploits in the 1914 excursion into vera cruz;   · how he leaped about the trenches of world war one like a mountain goat, often wounded, and promoted with blinding speed to brigadier general;   · his postwar service as west point's youngestand most progressivecommandant;   · his participation in the court-martial of billy mitchell in 1924;   · his routing of the bonus marchers in 1932;   · his efforts to sustain a woefully-underfunded army as chief of staff in the early 193o's;   · his retirement from the u.s. army to become field marshal (!) of the army of the philippines;   · and the reactivation of his commission by fdr shortly before the outbreak of the second world war.  all this is omitted in favor of prolonged footage of macarthur trying to fight off seasickness while being evacuated by pt boatthus, we know that ""general mac"" is a legend, but not why; nor can we appreciate why the allegations of cowardice were so wounding to ""dugout doug""and so patently unfounded.  the remainder of his career is presently straightforwardly: his island-hopping ""hit 'em where they ain't"" campaign, the fulfillment of his pledge to the filipinos ""i shall return!""his crowning achievement, the winning of the peace in postwar japan, then the difference of opinion with president harry truman (a properly feisty ed flanders) over the conduct of the korean conflict which resulted in his outright firing, and finally, his proclamation to congress that ""old soldierssimply fade away,"" after which he did just that. all quite historically accurate, and all presented with a very deliberate lack of commentary.  sargent and the producers almost painfully distance themselves from adorning the historical record with their own approval or disapproval: if macarthur's actions appear noble, let them be presented as such; if they appear egotistical or bombastic, let those conceptions register sans comment. since joe sargent is quite expert at subtly manipulating his audience's reactionsagain, see warm springsthis refusal to offer comment appears quite intentional. historically, that may be commendable, but it almost defeats the efforts of the viewer to place this extraordinary man in any kind of rational perspective.  and finally, there is a sort of ""made on the cheap"" feel to the film, as there is to ""midway,"" released about the same time. both films were relegated to ""television"" directors--sargent in this case, jack smight on ""midway,"" and both have a made-for-tv-look. even jerry goldsmith's march, while perfectly serviceable, lack the subtle undertones and the grandeur of his ""patton"" theme--just another way in which a larger-than-life man is memorialized by a very ordinary film.  there was vanity and pettiness in this man, inarguably; there was also greatnessand love him or loathe him, one must acknowledge the fact that macarthur did what no military commander before him had done: he won the peace.  in the end, ""macarthur""like so many film biographiesis a good place to begin research into this remarkable man, but a poor place to end it.",1
"a beautiful movie, especially if you like horses,wwii films and the austere hungarian plateau.a story of courage, compassion and loyalty that transcends generations. the horsemanship is spectacular as well as the main characters' horse in his own training.  i will buy this movie and watch it again. this is a family film and i recommend it highly.a good ''family nite'' movie. although there are some violent scenes, it was the nazi occupation of hungary.the native people were very interesting in the way they stood their ground even in the face of certain death from a nazi officer who had his own personal reasons for hunting down brady.a hauntingly beautiful film.",1
"i saw dick tracy when i was very young. i didn't know who any of the actors were, and i didn't know the movie would turn out different than the way it was previewed. i sure loved it though.  warren beatty stars as the crime-fighting 1930's detective dick tracy who goes after the biggest mob bosses in the city. this time, big boy caprice (al pacino) has killed a very powerful man and is out to take over the city with his singer girlfriend breathless mahoney (madonna) who has her eye on tracy. it becomes even worse because a new criminal is invading and the worst part is: this criminal has no face. he or she is very unknown. plus, the famous villians are back from the comic book collection.  i thought that this movie was very colorful and creative. it was entertaining and fun to watch especially as a child. warren beaty was just like james bond of the 1930's the way he played dick tracy.  an ensemble cast of the film includes: charlie korsmo, glenn headly, william forsythe, dustin hoffman, james caan, ed o' ross, tommy lee jones, mandy patinkin, charles durning. plus more!  dick tracy is a movie for all ages and is a fun movie for a family to enjoy. take my word for it.",1
"writer/director henry brommel has done a wonderful job with his film, ""panic,"" from the year 2000, and that includes his choice of cast: william h. macy, tracy ullman, john ritter, neve campbell, donald sutherland, barbara bain, david dorfman. brommel has cast ullman and ritter in decidedly un-funny roles, and the offbeat casting is a welcome change from what we normally see.  ""panic"" is the story of a hit man, alex (macy) who actually works for his father (sutherland). he covers his true profession by doing mail order work; by all appearances, he and his wife (ullman) and their son sammy (dorfman) are a typical suburban family. unhappy with his life, alex seeks the help of a psychiatrist (ritter), telling only his mother (bain). in the waiting room, he meets a young woman (campbell) to whom he is immediately attracted, which complicates his situation further. his mother breaks her promise and tells his father about the psychiatrist. when alex receives his next assignment, he discovers that he is to kill his psychiatrist.  this is a profound story of a gentle, good man made into a killer by a monster of a father, with his mother's knowledge, who kills to please his father but also can't stand up to him and quit. his rage is so deep-seated that he has lost emotional attachment to just about everything and everyone except his son - and it's finally his son who wakes him up out of a nearly lifelong repression. when it's time for ""panic"" to moves, it does - quickly.  ""panic"" doesn't seem panicked at all. in fact, it moves very slowly. but it moves slowly not because it's poorly made - the slowness is deliberate, mirroring alex's own psyche slowly coming out of the fog. by making a decision about sara, the campbell character, and by seeing his mark, his own psychiatrist, as a living, breathing human being, alex starts to make the connections between what he does and who he is -and how they don't jive. and the difference between the two could lead to the loss of another psyche, sammy's.  william macy gives another brilliant performance, as a loving father, a distant husband, and a cold killer, the child of two monsters who never cared a damn for his feelings or desires, a man who realizes finally that he has to step up to the plate or have the cycle repeated.  this is not the kind of drama that plays well in a movie theater. it's too adult, too small, too subtle, too character-driven, and too good.",1
"i agree that the movie is a little slow at spots having many scenes of mundane everyday life and no dialog. and i wasn't impressed right after i watched it. however, after a few days, i realized that the movie stays with me and it evokes a melancholy mood which lingers in my mind. my appreciation of this movie increases. it certainly merits a higher consideration than those movies that are instantly forgettable.  as many have commented, the movie is non-linear and that's a hallmark of european film-making as opposed to the linear narrative form that hollywood favors. i don't really know whether it's true or not. many also dislike its confusing structure and lack of clear explanations. to those viewers, i don't think there is much i can say to change their opinions. however, for others who have yet to see the film, do expect to be challenged and don't expect the film to supply all the answers and you might come away enjoying it more than you would otherwise.  the movie skips around a bit but really chronicles just 3 time periods. pay attention to the hair style and you can easily separate out 2 of the 3 periods. it is also not as confusing as suggested; just enjoy and it'll all be clear at the end.  yes, lots of things are left unsaid or not shown, and lots of situations are left unexplored. but isn't that what life is like? a lot of time you're not sure of the motives of your friends/loved ones unless you confront them and even then, you can never be 100% sure if they told you the whole truth. this type of movies forces us to interpret the reasons behind the actions. the movie does, however, leave enough hints for you to make some reasonable assumptions. for example, mathieu is manic depressive, to the point of suicidal. why? i don't know, maybe his life is not turning out exactly as he expects it; maybe he misses his family but hasn't forgiven his father for abandoning his sick mother at her hours of need; maybe after all he sacrifices for cedric, rearranging and indeed, shattering his life to be with him, he realizes that it is all ""coming undone"". i think the director meant to show us that he has always been a little off, mentality fragile by that scene w/ the dead bird. maybe he has a very sensitive psyche and all these stresses are taking a toll on him. but we're also shown that he is not some animal torturing psycho by his loving interaction w/ the stray cat. also, there is one conversation between the doctor and cedric that sheds light on the reason behind the breakup and maybe the suicide attempt. the doctor asks him if everything is okay, and cedric thinks so even though he cheated on mathieu once, but that's nothing, according to cedric. is that the only reason, we don't know, there are probably others, all mixed up together. is it paramount that we know exactly what they are? i don't think so, for this movie. another telltale sign that they are ultimately not compatible is the historical ruins scene. mathieu is interested in studying the ruins, cedric is not. he is the one w/ the raging hormone who focuses only on the physical side without an intellectual side that mathieu obviously needs.  finally, the ending is really rather hopeful and sweet. i was pleasantly surprised by the turn of events after the bleak tone that edges toward the end.  i have two complaints for the dvd. one is the sound. it's very soft. i had to crank up the volume to hear the dialog and then when it switched to a bar or outdoor crowd scene, it became too loud. the other is that the subtitles can't be turn off; they stay on the screen. most foreign movie dvds not released by a major studio are shoddy this way unfortunately.",1
"the tragedy of the doomed ship titanic has inspired many books and movies. the battle between nature and technology always caught man's imagination. the latest film concerning this tragedy in the atlantic ocean was written and directed by famous action movie filmmaker james cameron. the story of ""titanic"" involves two fictional characters (leonardo dicaprio and kate winslet) from different backgrounds (one is a hobo-artist, the other is an aristocrat) and how their love triumphs over societal barriers and the tragedy of a sinking ship that they happen to be on.  first of all, although using a historical name, this movie had little regard to history. the plot was built around two fictional lovers, french diamond, and treasure hunters. the deaths of over a thousand of people on the greatest luxury ship of its time became a mere background. many historical facts were simply forgotten. where was the radio operator that ignored the iceberg warnings? why was there no mention of the ship that was only 5 miles away from the titanic but did not come to the rescue because its captain failed to identify the distress signal? omitting these facts is an insult to the tragedy. and what was the point of flavoring this historical disaster with fictional cheesy romance when the story is already as sad as it is.  the overall plot was rather shallow; rich equals greed and corruption, poverty equals compassion and heroism. it is very ironic to spend $200 million to make a movie about how money corrupts. there was absolutely no human side shown in anti-heroes. it seemed like billy zane was playing a part of the devil. casting was also very poor. if dicaprio was 2 inches shorter than winslet, you could swear she was his baby-sitter. the length of the movie was unnecessarily stretched to over 3 hours. first hour and the half was wasted on establishing the relationships between the characters that were known to audience long before they went to theater and the dialogue that was used to do so made it even worse. hearing corny pick up lines such as ""i see you"" and ""this is my side of the ship"" generated more pain than the screams of drowning people. also, jokes were too abundant and rather lame.  ""titanic"" did involve some moving scenes such as the part when the musicians were playing while the ship was sinking but they were no way near anything original. the best thing about this film were its special effects, and that is the only thing that truly deserved an award.  although this film lacked artistical value in overall sense, the public could not resist a sentimental story starring romeo (dicaprio), and so the movie became a success. now it is safe to say that the industry will be less hesitant to invest large amounts of money in a single motion picture, so it seems that ""titanic"" did achieve something after all.",0
"terrible movie. if there is one turkish film you should avoid seeing in 2006, that should be banyo. what a waste of time. other than couple of cheap laughs this movie achieves nothing, nada, zilch, nil. the dialog is cheap, and sexual clichés are all over it. the director needs to watch more films before attempting to direct his own. the red headed women displays examples of what an actress should not do. if you are interested in learning how not to act this is a perfect example of bad acting. the only good thing i can say about the movie is, wait, wait, there is nothing good i can say about it. i must have really disliked it to write about it this much. jeez!",0
"shakespeare behind bars was the most surprising and delightful film i've seen all year. it's about a prison program, somewhere in california if i recall correctly, where the inmates have rehearsed and performed a different shakespeare play every year for the past 14 years. the film follows their production of ""the tempest"" from casting through performance, and in the process we learn some pretty amazing things about these men, who are all in for the most serious of crimes. truth is indeed stranger than fiction -- if anyone tried to adapt this story into a fiction film, the audience would never buy it, but knowing that it's real makes it breathtaking to watch -- literally; i gasped out loud when i learned of one particularly gifted felon's crime. it's like some loopy episode of oz, and all the more entertaining because the characters and their bizarre stories are real.",1
"i think its pretty safe to say that this is the worst film ever made, when i saw the trailer on tv i knew right from second 1 that this would be a piece of **** and it would be best to avoid it, but i somehow got dragged into seeing this by some friends, i walked into the cinema with low expectations but i was hoping there would be a couple of cheap laughs to keep me awake during this film. the so-called ""jokes"" in this film bring a cringe to the face, they are mostly comprised of people taking hits to the face and balls, the baby looking weird and acting like a horny gangsta and the typical race jokes we see so often in todays garbage comedies. the film is obvious and the story is not only impossible to believe but also predictable and dull. the characters are extremely annoying and heavily stereotyped. i never want to have to see this **** film again, i'd rather take a bullet to the foot than be exposed to this piece of fuckwood ever again. if anyone i see says they liked it i will physically punch them in the face",0

"if you haven't seen the gong show tv series then you won't like this movie much at all, not that knowing the series makes this a great movie.   i give it a 5 out of 10 because a few things make it kind of amusing that help make up for its obvious problems.  1) it's a funny snapshot of the era it was made in, the late 1970's and early 1980's. 2) you get a lot of funny cameos of people you've seen on the show. 3) it's interesting to see chuck (the host) when he isn't doing his on air tv personality. 4) you get to see a lot of bizarre people doing all sorts of weirdness just like you see on the tv show.  i won't list all the bad things because there's a lot of them, but here's a few of the most prominent.  1) the gong show movie has a lot of the actual tv show clips which gets tired at movie length. 2) the movie's story line outside of the clip segments is very weak and basically is made up of just one plot point. 3) chuck is actually halfway decent as an actor, but most of the rest of the actors are doing typical way over the top 1970's flatness.  it's a good movie to watch when you don't have an hour and a half you want to watch all at once. watch 20 minutes at a time and it's not so bad. but even then it's not so good either. ;)",0
there were times during the movie i wish i had been beat to death. the only reason i endured the entirety of the movie was because i couldn't believe how bad it really was and thought it must get better. this truly was a horror film. i was horrified that i wasted what seemed like 4 hours of my life that i will never get back. the other two hours i spent mourning at the loss. please recommend this movie to whomever you wish to torture and tell them the suspense will kill them.,0
"this movie started slowly, then gained momentum towards the middle. however, the fact that the movie ran over two nights broke that momentum at its peak. the second part really got interesting, but then gave way to a simply pathetic ending. playing football in the yard? really, could it get any more sappy and maudlin? now i hear plans for a similar movie based on the '70s. i won't make any great efforts to tune into that one if it's anything like ""the '60s.""",1

"after seeing you've got mail and feeling disappointed, i decided to see the original movie which inspired this one, the shop around the corner. i was amazed at this movie. it's a true gem and from this moment one of my favorite movies of all times. the acting is so perfect, the story is so beautiful, that if you haven't seen it, i wish to urge you to see it today. i'm not against re-makes and sometimes i like the new version more than the original one, but this time have to admit that you've got mail is a poor adaption of this classic. don't miss it, go to your video store and rent the shop around the corner today!",1
"a small pleasure in life is walking down the old movies aisle at the rental store, and picking stuff just because i haven't seen it. a large pleasure is occasionally taking that movie home and finding a small treasure like this playing on my screen.  long before elia kazan turned himself into a brand cranking out only notable movies (not good ones), he made this better than average drama. watching it you begin to notice how many decent, good or nicely observed scenes have accumulated. contrast that with his later films where the drama is writ large... preferably large, and unsubtle, and scandalous. kazan was eventually more of a calculating promoter than a director. (um. no thanks)   his future excesses are hinted at here only in the plot. the plague is coming! but here's an atypical richard widmark playing a family man in 1951 and avoiding most of the excesses of that trope; here's an almost watchable barabra bel geddes, with her bathos turned way down (well, for her); they're a couple and they share some nicely-written scenes about big crises and smaller ones. here's an expertly directed comic interrogation with a chatty ships-crew; here's a beautiful moment as a chase begins at an angular warehouse and a flock of birds shoots overhead punctuating the moment. these are the small-scale successes a movie can offer in which a viewer can actually recognize life; something hollywood, in its greed, now studiously avoids. these are the moments that make me go to the movies and enjoy them. it's a personable, human-scaled film, not the grotesque, overscaled production that he and others (david lean) will later popularize, whose legacy is still felt in crap as varied as pirates of the caribean and moulin rouge.  i just watched it twice and i'll be damned if i could tell you what jack palance is seeking in the final scenes, but it doesn't seem that important to me as a viewer. this reminds me of both no way out a poitier noir with widmark as the villain, and naked city, which you should really get your hands on.",1
"there are so many comments on this film, yet i found them to be misleading. this a corner-cutting, over-used scenario where a normal human being becomes a partner in crime to someone of the opposite sex for no apparent reason. boy meets girl. girl holds boy up at gunpoint for something ridiculous. boy is intrigued.   you know the drill: the antagonist turns out to be a wild, free spirit instead of a sociopath... toss in a few words of wisdom from alice drummond and you have a recipe for love. sheedy's 'is she crazy or does she just need a hug?' role from the breakfast club simply reeks as a lead character. and all that is left is a truly ghastly turkey of a movie.",0

"years have gone by since don wilson used his martial arts expertise to take down a robot who was programmed to destroy him, he's also married to the blonde reporter (stacie foster) who led the rebellion in the first film, now a new conspiracy is in the works, one that involves look-alike droids who frame our two heroes, and a corporation looking to rule the world (there is no plot to back any of this up) and cyber tracker 2 becomes a virtual replay of the first movie. i admit that i have bought dvds from the bargain bin that were made by pm, pm was a company that specialized in cheap-jack action flicks (like this) which had tons of explosions, little story and overall nothing but mean edged action. some of these titles have been (mildly) enjoyable (last man standing and the sweeper) however cyber tracker 2 is stuck with the casting of the charisma-less don wilson. when comparing the protagonists of similar pm efforts both jeff wincott and c. thomas howell are oscar nominees when compared to don wilson. another telling sign is that this was directed by richard pepin who has none of the flair joseph merhi seems to have in crafting action sequences that feel much more expensive than their budgets. then again though both c. thomas and wincott are probably more expensive to obtain. cyber tracker 2 is a rip off with a capitol r, there are so many steals from better movies (robocop, terminator, universal soldier to even halloween iii!) that it's almost as if richard pepin is trying to infuse a sense of identity to the pedestrian material yet without the intelligent ideas or at least the mindless zip of great action, cyber tracker 2 falls flat. there is literally no good idea that isn't borrowed from a better movie and the supporting cast overact. the only exception comes from tony burton who is miles better than the material. also stacie foster looks like she could be better with far better material. however cyber tracker 2 comes off mainly as noisy, bland and lackluster as its leading man, however with no real martial arts sequences to fall back on, all there is, is lots of cars tipping over and that alone is no substitute for the bankruptcy of ambition expressed here.  *1/2 out of 4-(poor)",0
"""a damsel in distress"" is definitely not one of fred astaire's better musicals. but even astaire's bad films always had some good moments.  in ""damsel,"" astaire is jerry halliday, an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour. he meets lady alice marshmorton (19-year-old joan fontaine), a beautiful english heiress, who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers.  jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt. he tries to rescue her from her family's country manor house, but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry. keggs (reginald gardiner) the conniving butler, and albert (harry watson), the bratty house boy, each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice's romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet.  this musical has numerous problems. first, there is the plot, based on a novel by p.g. wodehouse (who co-wrote the screenplay). the story is slow, painful, and nerve-grating. when fred is not dancing, we have to endure endless annoying scenes of (a) fred romancing joan fontaine or (b) keggs and albert conniving against them and each other.  the butler and the house boy are especially irritating. they are one-dimensional stock villain characters, the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth. you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance.  astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner, ginger rogers. joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film, and is miscast in a musical. she has little going for her, character-wise, other than her lovely face and beautiful smile.  george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride, as jerry's publicist and his ditzy secretary. the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot, and gracie has some funny lines, but she is also very annoying at times.  the direction of the movie by george stevens is not well done. at times, the cinematography is horrible and off-focus. there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets, to try to convince the audience that we are in london, not hollywood. (they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie.) on the plus side, the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific, and have become classic song standards. and of course, the dancing in the movie is exceptional, thanks to astaire and his choreographer, hermes pan.  but the musical and dance numbers are ill-used and ill-staged. at times, the cast seems to start singing and dancing because, well, it's time for them to start singing and dancing. the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot. (at one point, the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for no clear reason.) the numbers include:  ""i'm dancing and i can't be bothered now"" -- fred dances well on a foggy traffic-filled london street. he does some great ""cane-twirling"" with a rolled umbrella -- but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double-decker bus. (in the broadway musical, ""crazy for you,"" harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls.)   ""put me to the test"" -- fred, george, and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage. george and gracie match fred step for step, but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for no reason.   ""stiff upper lip"" (the fun house number) -- at an amusement park fun house, fred, george, and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor, rotating barrel, and with the fun house mirrors. it's the best number of the movie, but it gets a little repetitious at times.   ""things are looking up"" -- fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film, prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate. fortunately, it's a very simple dance number because joan is not a great dancer.   ""a foggy day in london town"" -- fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night, crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london. at times, he looks as if he's not sure which way he's going in the fog -- much like the musical number itself.   ""nice work if you can get it"" -- a great song that is misused in the movie. during a social event at the manor house, fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour-faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song. each time fred joins in, the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave. (again, harry groener did a better dance number with this song in ""crazy for you."")  ""drum dance number"" -- as fred and joan are eloping, fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums. as usual, it's a great dance number. but there's absolutely no need for it, except to prolong the movie.  the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine. as he leaps from the balcony, he finds a conveniently-placed trapeze -- that's right, a *trapeze* -- hanging from a nearby tree. fred (or rather, a stuntman in fred's clothes) grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it.  the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone, but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote. the >>ff button allows you to skip through the other, boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers.",0
"poor ivy: though to the manner born, she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel (richard ney). as the movie is set in the 20s or 30s, when rigid victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges, this uncertain status vexes her unduly. the gretorexes (for so they are called) don't know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancy-dress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her. when ivy (joan fontaine) makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent (herbert marshall, who must have been born middle-aged), she sets one of her extravant chapeaux for him. luckily, one of the beaux she still strings along (patric knowles) is a physician whose consulting rooms provide a cache of poison, with which she bids her hubby farewell. the fact that it implicates knowles doesn't phase her a bit, even as the hours trickle by until he should be hanged by the neck until dead. the turning of the plot depends on police inspector sir cedric hardwicke; knowles' mother (the redoubtable lucile watson); and knowles' loyal housekeeper (una o'connor). sam wood adds some subtle touches to this well above average melodrama; fontaine's luminous face supplies the rest.",1
"no matter how you look at this movie, it is just awful.  if you view it as a horror, then it is an unscary movie with the monsters being hand puppets.  if you look at it as a comedy, then you will notice most of the humor falls flat and is just lame.  if it is a romance you will wonder why a guy would stay with such a b**ch!  if you look at it as an action you can't really pull for the whiny hero.  as you can see this movie just fails to deliver anything remotely entertaining. as mentioned the monsters are obvious puppets and this film was another attempt at a gremlins type movie. this however has the worst looking monsters of that genre. critters looked pretty good, so did the ghoulies, heck even the puppets from the munchies looked better than these. the characters in this film are thouroughly unlikable. the hero is a whiney security guard, his girlfriend is always complaining, they have a tramp friend who has a jerk military boyfriend, and another friend who is a spaz. at one point in the movie the hero and the military guy fight with rakes...this movie is just utterly stupid. i like the scene when they are in the dreaded club scum (which is obviously not a club, but more likely a diner) and the hero tells the waitress that none of them are 21. give me a break, i am 25 and i look younger than any of them.",0
"i recently rented this doc, having remembered hearing about it from imdb.com and being intrigued by the premise. i knew very little about either of these bands, but i do remember hearing ""not if you were the last junkie on earth"" by the dandy warhols ages ago and enjoying it. that being said, this is my perspective on the doc:  one thing i found incredible about this film is there is no need to have any prior knowledge of either of these bands. the director (ondi timoner) wastes no time in engaging the audience and familiarizing them with the people in this film. i quickly became grooved to the lives both anton and courtney as well as their respective bands, the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols. i think that is part of what makes this doc so good, and what makes ondi timoner such a master documentarian.  i also loved how the ""story"" of these bands was told. most of what you see is of the bands on tour. both bands start out playing small venues and struggling to make it in the recording industry. throughout the film, each band strives to remain unique and uncontrolled by the norm. however it is this that makes the two bands similar, and thus the brilliant perspective on how two bands of a feather can go in such different directions.  i would basically recommend this for anyone who likes film in general. you do not need to have a particular love for documentaries, or either of the bands. an appreciation for music helps, but the music itself takes a backseat to the love/hate relationship between the brian jonestown massacre and the dandy warhols.",1
"honestly i can't understand why this movie rates so well here, nor why bakshi himself thought it was his finest film. i'm a huge fan of bakshi's earlier work - particularly 'heavy traffic' and 'wizards', but frankly 'wizards' (1977) was the last good film he made. after that he turned to the mainstream, beginning with the diabolical 'lord of the rings' and then knuckling down with sword and sorcery heavyweight frank frazetta, for 'fire and ice'.  what can i say? the story is puerile, the animation is tv quality - i insist that it's considerably worse than his 70's stuff - and whereas 'wizards' had real imagination, quirkiness, some gorgeous background art, and an underground, adult sensibility, 'fire and ice' is just designed for 14 year old boys, and has the intellectual clout of robinson crusoe on mars.  yes, if you liked the gor books, you might like this. in my view though, this was just another blip in the slide in quality after 'wizards' from which bakshi never recovered (though he's done some decent tv stuff fairly recently)  4.5 out of 10",0
"i remembered this as being one of my favorite books as a child and had been wanting to read it to my 5 year old daughter for a while now. i knew the movie was coming out soon so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview passes for the next day! we rushed home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare. wasn't necessary. the only thing in common between the book and the movie is the main characters' first name, the fact that there is a bet, and a whole lot of worm eating. oh yeah, i almost forgot, the kid who cooks most of the worms likes to present his masterpieces with a french accent. how the kids know each other, the number of kids involved, how the bet came about, the number of worms that must be eaten, the time frame in which he has to eat the worms, how they are cooked, progression of friendships, climax scenes, etc., nothing is the same. but somehow, it did not ruin the movie for me. the characters are all enjoyable, and the film did not leave me disappointed. word of caution for parents, there was one moment when you could hear the adults in the room collectively draw their breath and that was when billy's little brother referred to his penis as a ""dilly dick"". the embarrassing part came when my daughter proceeded to ask those sitting around us, ""does anybody know what a dilly dick is?"" lol. that and an occasional ""shut up"" is as foul mouthed as this film gets. my daughter thought she might get sick around worm 3 and 4 (and was holding the empty nacho container just in case) but was fine by worm 6. she and i both really enjoyed the film and had a wonderful time sharing the experience.",1
"this is not my favorite wip (""women in prison""), but it is one of the most famous films in the sub-genre. it is was produced by roger corman, who at this point had already produced a few wips. it is obvious that the film tries to play with the established formula. the movie takes place in an usa prison, not in a ""banana republic"" like most wip films. i'm not sure if that was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace. writer-director demme really gets into his job, always digging for new ways to present a familiar scenario. in fact, he is a little too ambitious for his own good. the filmmaker creates a few surreal dream sequences that are borderline pretentious but it is fun to see how hard he tries to put this film above your average chicks-in-chains flick. but do not worry, demme still operates within the parameters of the sub-genre. there is plenty of nudity and violence, something that will satisfy hardcore fans. the film is a little slow, but it is very entertaining. the cast is good. roberta collins is a wip veteran, so she does not need an introduction, and barbara steel is a hoot as the wheelchair-bound crazy warden. pam grier is sorely missed, though.",1
"this film was not nearly as much of a chore as i expected it to be. there are a few seconds of brilliance in this somewhat idiotic hardcore ufo conspiracy paranoia-fest. most of the acting is mediocre, but fairly typical for 1970s-style stuff replete with pregnant pauses. a photographer and a model witness some strange goings-on in the woods and soon fall victim to these same goings-on. flying saucers are spotted, more people disappear - but is it the aliens or our own government's ultra-secret group of cover-up guys? soon enough, a reporter and a ""ufologist"" (apparently modeled on the character of the writer-director) are drawn into this unraveling fiasco and become the target of the ultra-secret agents who are as menacing as they are improbable and witless. then the fun really begins.  the movie, predictably, makes about as much sense as the average ufo conspiracy theory, but should be commended for taking itself so seriously. the camera work is ok for a low-budget film, the pacing is pretty good, the script is silly and absurd, and there are continuity issues which are fun to look out for. what are the few seconds of brilliance i mentioned? honestly, i can't say much you without writing a spoiler. suffice to say that the end of the film is, at least, worth fast-forwarding to if you can't take the middle.",0
"personally i would advise people to stay clear of this movie. it's on the whole a bore to watch and the fighting is poorly choreographed. slow and not very convincing. if you buy the hong kong legends dvd release of this movie, then the only thing worth listening to is the bey logan audio commentary.  but in any case, since when has there ever been a ninja film worth watching. i cannot think of one and frankly do not wish to.  overall, when it comes to movies, i have one golden rule: avoid any films that contains the word 'ninja'.",0
"this film limps from self indulgent moment to self indulgent moment, promising to develop into something worth hanging on for. but it doesn't. it's flat, self conscious, unimaginative and tedious.  a series of set images and backdrops don't make a film, they make a calendar. this kind of pitiful socialist pseudo drama documentary (""it's true it really happened"") not only fails to entertain, it fails to convince, so it doesn't even function as social history. clichés co-mingled with bad acting make this a film very difficult to finish, the amusement factor wearing off fairly quickly. the characters are one dimensional, never developing to the extent that one feels for them. the director's ego is the largest character in this film.",0
"this is certainly one of the most bizarre films ever made - even for fellini. about the only one more bizarre is his satyricon. this is a two and a half hour romp through a strange nightmarish world of decadence, opulence and sexual challenge. sutherland makes a curiously unappealing casanova and the odd goings on in a series of unrelated vignettes taken from the great lover's autobiography fail to engage the viewer. the art direction and costume design are however outstanding. the academy missed on not even nominating the former but did itself justice by rewarding an oscar for the latter. also nominated (oddly) was the disjointed, pointless and almost inacessible screenplay. go figure!! the film on video is only 150 minutes, 16 minutes short of the original running time. this viewer was grateful.",0
"in a year of pretentious muck like ""synecdoche, new york"" a film born out of charlie kaufman's own self-indulgence, comes a film that is similarly hard to watch but about three times as important. ""frownland"" is a labor of love by the crew, the actors and the filmmaker, shot over years by friends. it traces a man who cannot communicate through his thoroughly authentic, real brooklyn world. the people that you see are a step beyond even the stylization of the ""mumblecore"" movement. they are real people, painfully trapped in their own self-contained neuroses, unwilling to change, unable. the real world to them is their own set of delusions and because this is a film about people who are so profoundly out of touch, it is very difficult to watch. it is 16mm film-making without proper light, money or any of the other factors that would make a film ""slick"", but its honesty can not be understated, a fact that would cause a room full of people to dismiss it and for richard linklater to give it an award as he did at sxsw. this does remind of films like ""naked"" or the best of the ""mumblecore"". it is a film that is not for everyone, but one that challenges you to watch and grows on you the longer you think about it.",1
"once you pick your jaw up from off the floor from the realization that they... somehow... managed to put this thing together so fast that it was released the same year the case ended, you'll find that it's not half bad. the plot is engaging and interesting, and the pacing is fast, with this covering many situations, and thus often jumping swiftly on to the next one after a line or two has been spoken. where this really stands out is the acting. the performances are excellent. neill and streep are both impeccable. it's also cool to hear so much australian spoken in a hollywood film, and even those who don't come naturally to it at least attempt an accent. the cinematography and editing are nice enough, but they don't really go beyond the standard stuff. this movie's story is compelling and the fact that it is authentic just makes it all the more chilling. while i have not read the novel or heard of what happened outside of this picture, i understand that it is quite close to the truth. there is some moderate to strong language and disturbing content in this. it is, at times, a downright great courtroom drama. i recommend this to any fellow fan of such. 7/10",1

"""godzilla vs king ghidorah"" is a perfect example how a great idea can be ruined by pathetic topics like pseudo-patriotism. here, travellers from the future try to ruin japan, replacing the local hero godzilla with their puppy monster, the three-headed golden dragon king ghidorah. they fail, however and in the end godzilla fights ghidorah. the battles between the two behemoths are very cool, but the plot of the movie is full with holes and the all thing about ""japan is great"" is really stupid. the creators of this movie didn't even threat with respect the enemies of japan, making them stupid big blond guys, who are easily outsmarted by the clever japanese. the good thing is that in the end godzilla and king ghidorah nearly destroyed the both japan and it's ridiculous enemies in one (actually two) spectacular combats. but till this battle royale, the film was really dull and pathetic.",0
"every once in a while , someone out of the blue looks at me a little sideways and asks ""what's with snitch'd"" ? i know immediately they have a case of barely-hidden amusement + horror. you see, i was the cinematographer on the film.  let me clarify some points regarding this ""interesting life experience"".  originally, snitch'd was called one hard hit. i met james cahill in july of 1999, a day after i wrapped triangle square, a great little 35mm feature that like so many indie features of the era never got distribution despite festival accolades...it fell eternal victim to the fine print of sag's notorious experimental feature contract. but i digress...  i though i was on a roll, and when james asked me to shoot his little gangster flick in 16mm with a shooting budget of about $25,000, not wanting to break pace, i took it. after all, clerks, el mariachi... i too believed the myth back then.  let's just chalk it up as ""film school"" for many involved, myself included. snitch'd was shot over two weeks in august, 1999, in aliso viejo and santa ana, ca. cahill taught drama at a high school in the latter city ( yes, he is a drama and english teacher...consider that while watching the film, or even observing the use of apostrophe in title ), hence the locations and cast.  of note in his cast were the only known dramatic appearance of l.a.'s channel 2 morning news weather girl vera jimenez, and of greater impact, the debut of eva longoria, who had just arrived in hollywood and was as eager as i to get a film under her belt. i must say her professional dedication, focus and ""let's do this"" attitude kept me inspired and was a foreshadow of her stardom-yet-to-come.   snitch'd suffered from poor optics, few lights or electricity, several boom operators du jour, and delivery of an uncorrected offline for duplication. none of that overshadows the actual content, which speaks for itself.  anyway, by 2003, the film was sold to distributors ( at a net loss, i understand ) who inexplicably had no photos of eva on the box ( by then she was a rising, working name ) but who did manage to obtain a clear photo of what appears to be an authentic latino gangster to lend credibility to snitch'd. since cahill's other passion is antiquarian book dealing, it appears to confirm he believes you can, in fact, judge a book by it's cover... as so many have picked up this dvd based on it's sleeve. ----------------- one year later, eva, now on a soap, and i met james for one day to shoot a simple short film he had concocted, split second, which i think has never seen any play despite festival intent.   6 years later, i was hired to shoot another cahill film titled juarez, mexico. i though he had worked out the process; my participation was contingent on casting, script and crew control, and the resultant film actually looked promising in dailies, for what it was... a cheap detective story surrounding the mass murders of girls in juarez; despite claims here and elsewhere, the film has never appeared in any festival or venue, although cahill has repeatedly claimed the film has distribution and was simply awaiting release to coincide with the dvd release of two studio pictures on the same subject, virgin of juarez and border town.",0
"the story is about ankush (abhay deol) - who is professional marriage witness, in short he acts as a witness for couples in marriage registration office - and megha (soha ali khan) who ran away from her home at nainital to get married to her love interest dhiraj (shayan munshi). the story starts with megha waiting at the marriage registration office for dhiraj to show up but for some reason he does not show up. so ankush comes in the picture here, who had approached megha with the intention of earning rs. 200 for his witness job and he ends up helping her by providing shelter to her. ankush grows on his side by working in a bank as an agent&#8230; ankush falls in love with megha and she too falls in love with him (or kind of love), both agree for the marriage and dhiraj comes back in the picture. unexpected circumstances happen, actually i should say, expected circumstances with unexpected reactions and then&#8230;.  actually the movie story is bit different than the movies we see and i do not think so it will be accepted by the masses but if you are a movie freak like me and love to watch something different, then you will definitely like the movie. the movie is just an innocent love story drafted very well by the characters of abhay deol and soha ali khan. the characters are so natural that you feel as if things are happening to the guy next door. the background music of the film also plays a very good role, it is just too good. the way delhi is shown is very good and gives a fresh feeling.  so let's cut it out and sum it up.  story: a very common story carried very well and transformed to a wonderful experience.  music: well, as it was himesh reshammiya creation, so i did not expect much but still i liked couple of songs of the movie including the qawwali.  acting: abhay deol was the most impressive, very natural and innocent acting but he should stay away from singing in the songs. soha ali khan, she is a doll, a very cute doll i must say. again very innocent and natural acting and these both actors perfectly fit into their characters. apart from these two, shayan munshi needs some acting lessons and may be few layers of fat to cover the bones. other actors did their job well.  stars: i would also give it 3.5 stars out of 5. you will enjoy the movie if watched in the theatre, i would recommend watching it in theatre if you are a movie freak and accept uncommon stories. otherwise wait for the dvd to arrive. the movie will definitely won't be liked by the masses and the business it can do is from word of mouth publicity.",1
"i had never heard of this flick despite the connection to george clooney (whose company produced and he appears in a very funny supporting bit) and his ocean's 11 director steven soderbergh. worse, we picked this up in a discount bin for $4.99 (canadian dollars at that!) what a grand and pleasant surprise. but then i'm of the opinion that if william h. macy is in it you can't be disappointed. this was very reminiscent of those ealing comedies from england in the 1950s. ok, with more profanity. this is an oddball and at times gut-splittingly funny film. the actual heist made me laugh so hard i was crying. perhaps the funniest use of underpants in movie history. maybe it was the low expectations i had going in but i watched with a group of people and we had a blast. best $5 i've spent in ages.",1
"i have seen the recent region 2 dvd of this movie displayed in the ""horror"" section in an oxford street store and also advertised as a ""classic thriller"". in reality it is almost solely a vehicle for arthur askey, one of the most popular names in british comedy and light entertainment for over four decades.  perhaps his incessantly cheerful, exuberant and essentially good-natured humour comes as a bit of a culture shock to many accustomed to the sour and cynical flavour of much british comedy of the past twenty five years. however there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheery persona and total avoidance of pathos. askey was an idol of the great tommy cooper who frequently borrowed the ""self-strangulation"" gag that arthur attempts to entertain the stranded passengers with.  there is a striking, rare appearance by the under-rated linden travers, who makes an impact as the mysterious julie.",1
"it's hard to say anything about a movie like this because there isn't enough words to give this magnificent, stylish and unique film the veneration it unquestionably deserves. they should make this the official and only true real hamlet -movie because all the previous films out of the same immortal spectacle are being overshadowed by kenneth branagh's ""hamlet"".  it's a perfect, complete version of the play, potent, massive, earthshaking first-class masterpiece shakespeare would have been proud of. they've packed over a dozen of world-famous top actors in the same film and everyone of them is having one of the greatest performances of their career. every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction.  the cameras embrace gracefully the enchanting coulisses. branagh is phenomenal in the leading role. his sharp, irresistible performance is the only one of it's kind and will be permanently part of the glorious movie history. every second in this presentation is feast for the movie lover from beginning to the very end. branagh's version of ""hamlet"" is among the ten best motion pictures ever.",1
"well. this was not a surprise. many people will tell you this is gory. but they are all talking ""shiztz"" this film is very slow.  it starts off with some guy who makes a concoction to feel no pain he calls it ""my son"" there is some gory scenes but i found them kind of weak. you might as well skip 40 minutes of the movie and get to the eyeball scene which was surprisingly impressive and sickening. there is some really stupid scenes in this. and they dub over the hits and slaps with stupid fake slapping sound which makes me laugh! i would not recommend it. keep looking gore hounds.  check this out if you want the like 20-10 minute ending scene which still is not that amazing and has a random scene of the guy trying to like rape his mum.. yeah its weird.",0
"the problem with family dramas is that, outside of tv movies on channels like lifetime, most people don't want to watch them. and the ones that do get watched tend to be sensationalized and about current or topical problems or issues in the news (or recent news). movies that explain or explore the human condition aren't popular. particularly with the young crowd that would be miss lohan's fan base or the younger crowd that tends to make movies not simply popular but financially successful for studios.  the specific problems i had with this movie is the cartoonishness of some of the characterizations. it was a bit much to blame all of the lohan's character's acting-out (wrecking the car, drug use, etc.) on what her step-father did to her. while not improbable,it's just a bit much to expect the audience to swallow. additionally, other aspects, such as her giving the young morman boy, oral sex, or that she would actually make a good assistant to the vet, who coincidentally happens to have a thing for her mother, etc., all these elements just did not really help this movie along. it placed it more in the element of a situation comedy trying one of their ""special dramatic episodes"" then it did for a fully realized, well-written feature film.  when you watch the dvd and listen to the commentary, particularly for the various alternate endings, you can really see all of this is sharp focus.",0
"conrad hall went out with a bang. the great film photographer finished his illustrious career with this movie before passing on. he did himself proud as this is one of the best-looking crime films you'll ever see.  of course, the acting ain't bad when you have tom hanks and paul newman playing the leads! the amount of action in here is just right, too: not too much; not too little.  none of the characters in here, frankly, are ""good guys"" as hanks is a professional hit-man for town boss newman. hanks' only redeeming quality is not wanting his young son to wind up a killer like him, although he does teach him how to be the getaway man in robberies! huh?  as good as the acting is and as interesting as the story is, the real star of this film is cinematographer hall, who paints scene after beautiful scene with his lens. his work is just awesome.",1
"as other viewers have mentioned, this film was an interesting experiment in photography. the colors are comic book bold. i think the director got carried away with his ""artistic vision"" over the look of the film instead o badly needed attention to content. despite its stellar cast, the performances are lackluster and the story nearly incoherent. madonna was likely cast purely as a stunt to get pre-release press. a good thing as her appearance here lent some credence to her album ""i'm breathless (music inspired by the film dick tracy)"" which was a stratospheric hit (due in large part to the inclusion of dance-hit ""vogue"" - which is not in, nor has the slightest relation to this film). i'd guess the major portion of money from this film came from tie-ins to madonna's ""i'm breathless"" album.  if you watch it at home, by end-titles, you'll think ""there's two hours out of my life i'd like to have back."" save yourself the wasted time - do not bother with this.",0
"this is not a commentary on the actual movie, but on the ruscico dvd release for north america. i don't know if there have been different releases and updates, but the disks we rented had a 2000 copyright on them, if that means anything. anyway, the sound mixing on these dvd's was absolutely horrible. the levels often yo-yo-ed up and down; when the scene cut to a battlefield panorama, the orchestral track would thunder so loudly that i didn't know which would blow out first -- my eardrums or my speakers. when it was time for dialog, the volume would usually drop to something barely audible. occasionally, the orchestra and foley-work would stay loud while the dialog was superimposed at a much lesser level. my wife and i found that the only way we could watch this movie at all from these dvd's was if one of us kept a hand on the remote to continuously modulate the volume. and, like another user has already commented, when we selected english audio the dialog kept switching back and forth between russian and english; and occasionally when the characters spoke in french on the native track the dubbing was in russian, so you're sol if you understand neither. ultimately, we gave up watching after the first disk. before you fork out $50+ for this movie on dvd for your own library, i'd heartily recommend getting your hands on a rental copy to see whether you can really enjoy this epic flick when burdened by such bad sound, particularly if you've never read the book and really want to understand the storyline.",0
"if you're looking to be either offended or amused or both, you'll probably have to look elsewhere. lmotp really isn't even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés. at the end of the second episode i felt a little embarrassed that i actually sat through the contrived mess.  beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place it's just another lame, innocuous and anti-septic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the cbc typically excels at producing. and once the ""zomg muslims in rural canada roflmao!!"" hype wears out its welcome, the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because it's so shallow when judged on its merits alone.  unless you're obsessed with muslim culture in the west and/or are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject i really don't see how lmotp is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype. other shows have better addressed the issue of cultural/ethnic dichotomy in western multi-ethnic societies. lmotp will never rank among them in entertainment or insight.",0
"i thought that i was never going to find a horror movie as bad as ""the return of the texas chainsaw massacre"", but this film compete with it.  i´m not a person that get asleep when watching a movie, but i did it 15 minutes after the trance started. i woke up, and started to watching it agian. why did i deserve that? all the movie was a torture, i have to use fast forward to watch it complete.  i can´t stand why one of my favourites actors of all time (mr. walken) could done this thing. i have to think that he made the director a favor, or he was really in the need of money, because film after film he is doing, he is ruining himself; and so fast...  what about the movie? it´s not scary, stupid plot, characters are awful (but i really liked the one played by jared harris), effects are very poor, lack of deaths & blood, etc; in three words, it has anything. and i mean it. can´t stand how a director can make a film like this.  anyway, when i got more disappointed was when i saw in the video cover, that the film was presented by ""stephen king"", i think he could never present this crap, no? (i rented it in argentina). i not recommend it in a million years.  i rate this movie with a 2 out of 10.

"manhattan apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences. the worst one is the lack of closet space! some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already full!  melvin frank and norman panama, a great comedy writing team from that era, saw the potential in eric hodgins novel, whose hero, jim blandings, can't stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife muriel, and two daughters, must share.  jim blandings, a madison ave. executive, has had it! when he sees an ad for connecticut living, he decides to take a look. obviously, a first time owner, jim is duped by the real estate man into buying the dilapidated house he is taken to inspect by an unscrupulous agent. this is only the beginning of his problems.  whatever could be wrong, goes wrong. the architect is asked to come out with a plan that doesn't work for the new house, after the original one is razed. as one problem leads to another, more money is necessary, and whatever was going to be the original cost, ends up in an inflated price that jim could not really afford.  the film is fun because of the three principals in it. cary grant was an actor who clearly understood the character he was playing and makes the most out of jim blandings. myrna loy, was a delightful actress who was always effective playing opposite mr. grant. the third character, bill cole, an old boyfriend of myrna, turned lawyer for the blandings, is suave and debonair, the way melvin douglas portrayed him. one of the blandings girls, joan, is played by sharyn moffett, who bore an uncanny resemblance to eva marie saint. the great louise beavers plays gussie, but doesn't have much to do.  the film is lovingly photographed by james wong howe, who clearly knew what to do to make this film appear much better. the direction of h.c. potter is light and he succeeded in this film that will delight fans of classic comedies.",1
"i watched fido on some movie channel and i have to say that i've become an instant fan. the film feels like a comic book that perfectly captures the look and feel of the surreal 1950s, you know the wholesome decade when they danced to elvis while dropping nuclear bombs in the desert just for the heck of it. people were so naive back then that it's frightening and the idea that those clean cut folks would find it normal to have zombies as pets actually works here.  kudos to this canadian production, the colorful crisp cinematography and the excellent cast, including carrie anne moss, billy connolly, henry czerny and the kid.  it's a shame this film wasn't a bigger hit. it deserved more recognition. it's much better than the stuff from tim burton or the shaun of the dead team. oh well. it's an instant classic nonetheless.",1
"""hollywood hotel"" has relationships to many films like ""ella cinders"" and ""merton of the movies"" about someone winning a contest including a contract to make films in hollywood, only to find the road to stardom either paved with pitfalls or non-existent. in fact, as i was watching it tonight, on turner classic movies, i was considering whether or not the authors of the later musical classic ""singing in the rain"" may have taken some of their ideas from ""hollywood hotel"", most notably a temperamental leading lady star in a movie studio and a conclusion concerning one person singing a film score while another person got the credit by mouthing along on screen.  ""hollywood hotel"" is a fascinating example of movie making in the 1930s. among the supporting players is louella parsons, playing herself (and, despite some negative comments i've seen, she has a very ingratiating personality on screen and a natural command of her lines). she is not the only real person in the script. make-up specialist perc westmore briefly appears as himself to try to make one character resemble another.  this film also was one of the first in the career of young mr. ronald reagan, playing a radio interviewer at a movie premiere. reagan actually does quite nicely in his brief scenes - particularly when he realizes that nobody dick powell is about to take over the microphone when it should be used with more important people.  dick powell has won a hollywood contract in a contest, and is leaving his job as a saxophonist in benny goodman's band. the beginning of this film, by the way, is quite impressive, as the band drives in a parade of trucks to give a proper goodbye to powell. they end up singing ""hooray for hollywood"". the interesting thing about this wonderful number is that a lyric has been left out on purpose. throughout the johnny mercer lyrics are references to such hollywood as max factor the make-up king, rin tin tin, and even a hint of tarzan. but the original song lyric referred to looking like tyrone power. obviously jack warner and his brothers were not going to advertise the leading man of 20th century fox, and the name donald duck was substituted. in any event the number showed the singers and instrumentalists of goodman's orchestra at their best. so did a later five minute section of the film, where the band is rehearsing.  powell leaves the band and his girl friend (frances langford) and goes to hollywood, only to find he is a contract player (most likely for musicals involving saxophonists). he is met by allen joslyn, the publicist of the studio (the owner is grant mitchell). joslyn is not a bad fellow, but he is busy and he tends to slough off people unless it is necessary to speak to them. he parks powell at a room at the hollywood hotel, which is also where the studio's temperamental star (lola lane) lives with her father (hugh herbert), her sister (mabel todd), and her sensible if cynical assistant (glenda farrell). lane is like jean hagen in ""singing in the rain"", except her speaking voice is good. her version of ""dan lockwood"" is one ""alexander dupre"" (alan mowbray, scene stealing with ease several times). the only difference is that mowbray is not a nice guy like gene kelly was, and lane (when not wrapped up in her ego) is fully aware of it. having a fit on being by-passed for an out-of-the ordinary role she wanted, she refuses to attend the premiere of her latest film. joslyn finds a double for her (lola's real life sister rosemary lane), and rosemary is made up to play the star at the premiere and the follow-up party. but she attends with powell (joslyn wanting someone who doesn't know the real lola). this leads to powell knocking down mowbray when the latter makes a pest of himself. but otherwise the evening is a success, and when the two are together they start finding each other attractive.  the complications deal with lola coming back and slapping powell in the face, after mowbray complains he was attacked by powell (""and his gang of hoodlums""). powell's contract is bought out. working with photographer turned agent ted healey (actually not too bad in this film - he even tries to do a jolson imitation at one point), the two try to find work, ending up as employees at a hamburger stand run by bad tempered edgar kennedy (the number of broken dishes and singing customers in the restaurant give edgar plenty of time to do his slow burns with gusto). eventually powell gets a ""break"" by being hired to be dupre's singing voice in a rip-off of ""gone with the wind"". this leads to the final section of the film, when rosemary lane, herbert, and healey help give powell his chance to show it's his voice, not mowbrays.  it's quite a cute and appealing film even now. the worst aspects are due to it's time. several jokes concerning african-americans are no longer tolerable (while trying to photograph powell as he arrives in hollywood, healey accidentally photographs a porter, and mentions to joslyn to watch out, powell photographs too darkly - get the point?). also a bit with curt bois as a fashion designer for lola lane, who is (shall we say) too high strung is not very tolerable either. herbert's ""hoo-hoo""ing is a bit much (too much of the time) but it was really popular in 1937. and an incident where healey nearly gets into a brawl at the premiere (this was one of his last films) reminds people of the tragic, still mysterious end of the comedian in december 1937. but most of the film is quite good, and won't disappoint the viewer in 2008.",1
"this ludicrous film offers the standard 1970's ""hippie mentality"" in a nut shell and bores us in the process. its an attempt to rationalize absurd marriages of young, innocent women with old age sex fiends and wash ups. a naive young hippy played by the waif-like ( kay lenz ) hitch hikes and sleeps with all the wrong guys, and then one day she meets the ridiculous (holden), already in old age, hard liquor drinking and washed up as an actor, and she decides that she is in ""love"" with him. if you think that is superficial, the whole film encapsulates such scenes. she keeps saying how much she ""loves"" him and she only met him, it wears thin and really quick. i couldn't help but laugh throughout the film. its obvious she's just using him as a meal ticket but the director is immature enough to think we are going to buy that there is actually any love taking place. a disgusting scene is where the two are naked and having sex, i had to fast forward it because it almost inspired me to vomit. a corny offering of music from the 70's is also spread through the film. avoid this if you can. grade d.",0
"i think i should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts. the true test is whether it is good from start to finish, which is the reason i gave the analogical title for this review. most of us would agree--even those like me, who enjoy reading many blogs--that blogs can't compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons. likewise, fem can't compare with good film making for a number of reasons, and i actually believe it's a poor example of independent filmography. from start to finish, fem feels like a pieced together vlog. (heck, even myspace gets some pimping.) if i wanted to see an hour of lonelygirl15--i don't--i'd go watch it. fem, while certainly grittier than the bubble gum atmosphere of the aforementioned media, is so personal that it is without an interesting story. it's like watching the mundaneness of life, which i think most would agree is very naturally boring. and yet the creators of fem want us to applaud it, their very postmodern film about making a film. cue my yawn.  ultimately, i come away not caring the least bit about any of it. i'm shocked that i'm actually interested in taking time out to write this review, even. it's not that fem is downright bad, because it isn't; it has a few moments where i crack a smile or think that maybe--just maybe--something of interest is about to happen. it's rather that it's just downright...mediocre. i feel so indifferent about it that it's almost fitting of an oxymoron: passionate indifference.  i hope the creators/""actors"" in the film get out of debt from their efforts. they'll probably need it for when one of them moves out and moves on with life.  see this movie if you've got time to waste and nothing much you want to do; otherwise, pass it by, and don't worry that you've missed some great, undiscovered talent. you really haven't.",0
"we all have friends. some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with, people that you can say are like your brother or sister. alice ( danes )and darlene ( beckinsale ) are like that. you can see that from the beginning. they graduated together, they go to parties together and they decide to go to bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to hawaii. they also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster. the rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope. it also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone.  brokedown palace is a very good film, it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that i want to talk about. but first i want to say what is good about the film. and for starters the acting is top notch, and you can look no further than the two leads. danes and beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have. alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges, but she seems more fun than darlene. but sometimes that fun can get her into trouble. darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes, it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of alice's. bill pullman is adequate as the american lawyer living in thailand. the film is photographed very well also. the inside of the prison while not the same as shawshank or natural born killers or return to paradice, but it does show the necessary ( but underdone) hopelessness of the situation that they are in. johnathin kaplan's direction is quite good as well. we see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day. brokedown palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive. the other thing that i had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film. it heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection. the song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison. you can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life. and it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do. we have it easy compared to some country's and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject. some of the music is done by a group called delirium ( i think ) but it is sara mclaughlin( wrong spelling, but how do you spell her last name? ) that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the film.  what i didn't enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit. i won't say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself you'll know what i am talking about. also i didn't really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad. it looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country, the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic. but i didn't get that here.  overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question, "" how far would you go for a friend?

"i saw chan is missing when it first came out, about four years after moving from san francisco to new york. maybe it was the perspective of a few years away, but this movie seemed to capture the essence of the city and its people better than anything else i'd ever seen (still does). it concentrates on one particular community - the chinese - but that's fine, because so much of the city's soul is refracted through the settings, the faces, and the maybe above all the voices of the characters.  this isn't the tourists' san francisco. the settings are humble and everyday: a taxi cab, the kitchen of a chinese restaurant, richmond district row houses, little chinatown apartments and small-business offices, the piers, a philippine elder center. this is what the city looks and feels like day to day to the people who live there - even now, in the era of silicon gulch urban redevelopment. unlike, say, dirty harry (in its own way an excellent san francisco movie as well), everything is filmed at street level: we come to understand the characters' points of view from the perspective their surroundings give them, not from some fancy vertiginous shooting.  wang apparently filmed in b&w because he didn't have the money to do otherwise, yet one of the strongest visual elements of the movie is the natural light he achieves. the often harsh, pervasive quality of the sunlight is one of my closest associations with san francisco: it seems to expose everything, bringing the buildings, the hills, the other landmarks down in scale and, in a funny way, making the people you pass on the streets seem more individual and potentially closer to you than they might in another place. wang's photography perfectly conveys this, and even helps the story along at points.  wang captures the speech and conversational style of chinese and other san franciscans better than anyone ever has, i think. if there's such thing as a true san francisco ""accent,"" it's what you hear from the balding taxi medallion broker (i think) who appears talking on the phone in one scene (listen to the way he calls the person on the other end ""ya dingaling!"").  the story is poignant and, despite a few very small missteps, makes its points beautifully about the longings that pull at the hearts of people living in old immigrant communities - including the justified political and ethnic resentments, and little ironic amusements, that help to fuel them. all this is communicated delicately - perhaps why some respondents here think the film meanders. it doesn't - suffice it to say that the two cab drivers' quest for chan becomes a quest for something more personal.  chan is missing finishes up with a chinatown travelogue sequence backed by a goofy novelty song from the 1930s (i guess) about san francisco and all its crazy diversity. an american caricature, yes, but somehow not entirely off the mark either.",0
"you know the story - a group of plucky no-hopers enter a competition they seemingly have no chance of winning - it's a tale that has been done to death by hollywood (bring it on, the karate kid, escape to victory, best of the best etc). now korea gives it a go with a taekwondo team struggling for glory  and guess what  the result is predictable but ultimately satisfying.  the fact that this movie doesn't fall flat on its face is down to the talented young cast who really make you care about the characters, and this in turn keeps you watching to the end.  fans of your typical martial arts movie may be disappointed  taekwondo does not deliver the usual flurry of moves and acrobatics seen in most kung fu films; the action is limited to (albeit impressive) kicking and the occasional punch. this doesn't matter though, since it is the interaction of the characters and their fight to make something of themselves which makes this movie a success.",1
"""spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning. but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty? nobody should love that."" - lucius shepard  ""the color purple"" takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s, and tells the story of celie and nettie, two african american sisters. the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers, an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather. this motif  innocence interrupted by men  permeates the entire film.  the film then launches into a series of short sequences. celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather, gives birth in a dirty barn, has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson, a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly, forcing her to cook, clean and look after his children.  all these horrific scenes are given little screen time, and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie-dust cinematography, a meddlesome symphonic score, incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work. the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie, a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that ""the color purple"" made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes. ten minutes? he lasted a long time.  the film is often said to deal which ""racism"", ""sexism"" and ""black culture"", but this is not true. alice walker, the author of the novel upon which the film is based, claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian. her book is a lesbian fantasy, a story of female liberation and self-discovery, which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women. for walker, the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia, black sisterhood and female independence celebrated.  spielberg's film, however, re-frames walker's story through the lens of comforting american mythologies. this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men. a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations, moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool. a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows, the cast comprised of lecherous men (always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins), stereotypical fat mammies, jazz bands and gospel choirs.   this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike, readily and happily accepting their social conditions. a film in which black people are over-sexed, carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions. a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible (albert lives in a huge house) and black men are completely inept. this is not the old south, this is the old south as derived from ""gone with the wind"", mgm muscals, ""song of the south"", warner cartoons, ""halleluha!"" and banned disney movies. in other words, it's the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv. it's all so cartoonish, so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes, that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy.  of course, in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed. this reconciliation was in walker's novel, but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin.  beyond walker's hate letter to black men and spielberg's bizarre caricaturing of black life, we are shown nothing of the black community. we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and no insight into how they interact with others in their community. instead, spielberg's camera jumps about, desperately fighting for our attention (one of celie's kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a ""home alone"" movie), every emotion over played, the director never stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by. couple this with quincy jones' ridiculously ""white"" music, and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history: an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith, scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams.  problematic too is the lack of white characters. consider this: the men in this film aren't portrayed as being rough to each other, nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood. no, they are cruel by nature. and the women, whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister, persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them. a better film would not have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed, rather, it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse, that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts (whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles) and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors, women unable to support themselves and their children alone.  and so there's a hidden ideology at work here. late in the film one character tells another that since he didn't respect his wife, she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites. the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them. ie- respect one another in your poor minority community and you won't run afoul of the dominant white culture.   3/10 - a failure to confront sex and lesbianism, inappropriate musical numbers, countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz, incongruous comic business, emphatic music cues, and wildly hyped emotionality, all contribute to rendering ""the color purple"" worthless.",0
"this film contains the one ingredient that all revenge movies should have and that is true emotion. sorrow, love, laughter , anger. there are so many emotions thrown into this film. from start to finish this film is immensely captivating. the plot on paper sounds like the usually rubbish that is mostly thrown in the faces of the audiences but don't be mistaken, this film is powerful. washington as always puts on a great performance.  the plot in a nutshell: man suffers from depression, a young girl brings life into him, kids gets kidnap, man wants revenge. doesn't sound like anything special but it far superior than any other similar film out there. for instant, taken is a similar film but when you compare them both, man on fire wins hands down. the characters are engaging and everyone puts in a great performance and the directing is great. mexico city feels alive , it looks like mexico city, it smells like mexico city. everything is portrayed brilliantly . the style of direction was something i enjoyed and brought the best out of mexico city  this is one of those films you'll bring out once a year to watch again or a film that you'll beg your family and friends to watch. from start to finish you are rooting for the main protagonist, making it a roller-coaster journey. there enough action to keep you happy, there enough character development to please you and then there's washington to bring a smile to your face . watch this film, you won't be disappointed",1
"i know that this is an unpopular position concerning zabriskie point, but i loved this film. i know, i know - i can legitimately be called an antonioni fanatic. i love l'avventura, i love la notte, i love l'eclisse, i love red desert, i love blowup, and i love professione: reporter (aka the passenger). the only antonioni film that i don't love, the only one i've ever given less than an 8/10 (and one of only three that i have given less than a 10/10, la notte and l'eclisse being the other two, though i fully acknowledge that i have to see both of them again), is beyond the clouds, which can fairly be called an awful film. however, there is not better awful film, if you catch my drift. so if you're not an antonioni fan, you should only logically ignore me. if you are even a casual fan, though, and you are wondering whether this particular film, whose name, when spoken, is often followed by  a spit, which is generally despised by even antonioni's admirers, is at all worth seeing, the answer is yes.  okay, the reason that people tend to hate it is because 99% of film watchers care only for the narrative of a film. well, that's not exactly true. if a film is amazing in a particular aspect, say acting or cinematography or direction, and just decent in its narrative, film watchers might very well love it. but a film can be the most amazing visual masterpiece and have a lame or illogical story - that's another thing that has ruined the cinema over the years: logic - then they absolutely hate the film. i will actually agree with that in some ways. as much as i may dislike it and want to change my view, it really is difficult to love a film whose narrative i perceive as poor. however, other people tend to get annoyed at a loose narrative. this is certainly what must drive viewers away from zabriskie point. i could relate the story to you, but you probably would just think it was nonsensical. it is, actually, but, to me, that just made the whole endeavor more fantastic and beautiful. i'd actually compare it favorably to 2001, which is my favorite film. however, 2001 is perfectly coherent compared to the rambling narrative of this film.  what zabriskie point has in spades is mood. the music helps a lot; the score includes a lot of acts of the day, including pink floyd. the mood is kind of similar to the moods of antonioni's other masterpieces, filled with loneliness and desolation. also the freedom that comes from that. the best sequence in the film is when the lead man and woman (her name is daria, i know, but i don't remember his name) pull over in their vehicle next to a historic marker on a desert highway. there is, beyond the stone wall that has been erected to keep cars from flying off, an ancient lakebed. it's basically a rocky desert, and the two go to play in it. the setting is enormously beautiful. the woman says: ""this is such a beautiful place. what do you think?"" the man: ""i think it's dead."" there's no inclination to whether that's a good thing or a bad thing. this is a lot like sentiments expressed in other antonioni films - characters are constantly wanting to disappear or become invisible. instead of david locke, the protagonist of the passenger, fed up with journalism, we have the young hippie sick of his friends' politics - he thinks they talk too much and don't act out what they feel is right, or at least he says he does. it seems to me more like he just wanted out of the situation.  the film is also simply amazing visually. antonioni's films are all identifiable by just a few frames, but his visual style was always building. i like the passenger more than i do zabriskie point, but zabriskie point might be his ultimate accomplishment in that aspect. well, that might sound odd - l'avventura and red desert are amazing pictorially. i think it's the camera movements that are particularly amazing here. he obviously made a ton of money on blowup, which was the biggest arthouse hit of its day, the biggest ever at that point. he spends it well here, especially with his aerial shots. one of the film's greatest sequences involves the man, who has stolen a man's private airplane, dive-bombing daria in her car.  the one thing that can be fairly criticized is the film's politics. they're certainly facile. not that hippies were facile, but that antonioni's vision of hippies - there weren't any in italy, of course - are bizarre and, well, filtered through a foreigner's eyes. there's a rather childish criticism of advertising, but it's a criticism that still exists today. i say, can't you people just ignore it? what does it hurt? are you walking around buying things you don't want because of billboards? or there is also the criticism against capitalism. daria, a secretary, works for a company that is stealing the land in the desert - the land that she and the man enjoyed to themselves - in order to make cheap, suburban homes for families. rod taylor, a very underrated actor whose most famous roles were in the time machine and the birds, plays her boss. the ending, which i won't ruin - you've got to see it - is almost offensively cheap. i can, though, understand the treatment of police officers. not that i disdain them generally, but they were awful at the time. they can still be awful now. they've always had too much power.  these trite arguments against the american way of life still don't effect my opinion of the film much. i find this filtered view of america extremely interesting. i really don't think a hippie would have disagreed with antonioni. 10/10.",1
"i had initially heard of tears of kali a while back and it sounded like something i'd be into, but with all the films i have coming in on a regular basis, it kinda fell off my radar. while roaming around the local wonderbook...i spotted the box for this one and grabbed it up. i have to say i'm pretty glad i did. tears of kali is a strange, gory, sometimes downright creepy film which is somewhat constrained by it's obviously low budget - but is still an entertaining and worthwhile watch.  tears of kali centers around the fictional india-based taylor-erikkson cult group, that practices meditation and other rituals in the pursuit of facing and banishing the individual's ""inner demons"" - but apparently these techniques work either all too well or not well enough (depending on your viewpoint...) as dark forces are not only exorcised, but also unleashed upon hapless victims.  the film is told ""anthology-style"", with a short but memorable and ""eye-opening"" intro sequence, and then proceeding into the three stories that make up the bulk of the film.  the first (shakti) is about a journalist who visits one of the cult-members who is being held at a mental hospital. the journalist goes in under cover of wanting to research the taylor-erikkson cult, but we find that her true motives may hit a little closer to home. when the interview takes a violent turn, the journalist finds that she may have gotten in over her head...  the second part (devi) concerns a violent young man who is sentenced to psychological rehab in lieu of a prison sentence for beating a young man into a coma. we find that the treating doctor in question is actually a taylor-erikkson ""alumni"", and his rehabilitation methods are far from the norm...  the closing story (kali) revolves around a quack ""faith-healer"" and his assistant who perform ""miracles"" for a fee. when the healer unwittingly helps one of his clients and actually expels a force which had been possessing her, the demon is now free to roam and looking for a new host...  i gotta say i really enjoyed tears of kali. there are some faults with the film that keep it from being truly excellent - but it is an original and ambitious film for what it is. my biggest gripe with the production is the poor and uninspired over-dubbed dialogue. the dubbing is sub-par and i would have much preferred to have a subtitled option with the original language track. some reviewers have said the acting is poor, which i don't necessarily agree with. i think that the dubbing is so lack-luster that it makes the performances seem stunted, which isn't really the case. in fact, a few of the performances are pretty damn chilling (the ""doctor"" in the second segment, and the ""client"" in the third readily come to mind...) and notable. the gore fx are very well done for a low-budget film, with some graphic scenes of eyelid-removal-via-cuticle-scissors, a pencil-in-the-throat-suicide, some decent (but irritatingly ""shaky"") self-flaying, and a few other goodies thrown in for good measure. not as rough as some of the more ""extreme"" gore films out there, but definitely stronger than your average horror fare. i also found the story concerning the cult-group to be intriguing and a welcome change to the typical horror-story nonsense. there are plenty of scenes of genuine atmosphere and tension, the likes of which i haven't come across in a while. although flawed in some fundamental ways, i still think tears of kali will appeal to most ""underground"" horror viewers - some scenes may prove too much for the more mainstream viewer. definitely recommended - 8.5/10",1
"""a cry in the dark"" is a masterful piece of cinema, haunting, and incredibly though provoking. the true story of lindy chamberland, who, in 1980, witnessed a horrific sight, seeing her 3-month-old baby being brutally taken from their family's tent, while camping on the austrailian outback. azaria (the baby) was never seen again, and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world. meryl streep does immaculate justice to the role of lindy, as she always does. but the one thing that helps ""a cry in the dark"" never fall flat is the brilliant direction. a truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling case, tears are brought to the eyes. the concept is nothing less then terrifying, and afterwards you are left haunted, but also inspired.",1
"master cinéaste alain resnais likes to work with those actors who are a part of his family.in this film too we see resnais' family members like pierre arditi, sabine azema, andré dussolier and fanny ardant dealing with serious themes like death,religion,suicide,love and their overall implications on our daily lives.the formal nature of relationship shared by these people is evident as even friends, they address each other using a formal you.in 1984,while making l'amour à mort,resnais dealt with time,memory and space to unravel the mysteries of a fundamental question of human existence :is love stronger than death ? it was 16 years ago in 1968 that resnais made a somewhat similar film je t'aime je t'aime which was also about love and memories.message of this film is loud and clear :true and deep love can even put science to shame as dead lovers regain their lost lives leaving doctors to care for their reputation.l'amour à mort is like a game which is not at all didactic.it is a film in which the musical score is in perfect tandem with its images.this is one of the reasons why this film can easily be grasped.",1

"the author sets out on a ""journey of discovery"" of his ""roots"" in the southern tobacco industry because he believes that the (completely and deservedly forgotten) movie ""bright leaf"" is about an ancestor of his. its not, and he in fact discovers nothing of even mild interest in this absolutely silly and self-indulgent glorified home movie, suitable for screening at (the director's) drunken family reunions but certainly not for commercial - or even non-commercial release. a good reminder of why most independent films are not picked up by major studios - because they are boring, irrelevant and of no interest to anyone but the director and his/her immediate circles. avoid at all costs!",0
"i can't believe this movie was made as recently as 1984. it's got some laughable acting, not to mention one of the stupidest plots ever. who would ever ask fat texas sheriff joe don baker to escort an italian he illegally arrested in mexico back to italy? not to mention that the title of the movie tells you pretty much nothing about it - in fact, it's about as generic a title for a wannabe action/cop film as i can think of.  i'm glad i only saw this on mst3k with mike and the bots as a shield. they remark on the female lead's resemblance to elaine from seinfeld (""none of them are spongeworthy"") and riff non-stop on baker's weight. this movie probably isn't worse than ""mitchell,"" but baker's reputation definitely precedes him here: when his title comes up at the beginning of the film, tom says, ""i wish i was illiterate so i wouldn't have to read that.""",0

"while thinking of ""the great escape"" i allowed my mind to wander back to this little gem of a movie from my childhood. i had read and re-read the autobiographical novel from 1949 which inspired it, and when it came to the only cinema (we never used that word then , actually) in town that showed ""foreign"" films, i was first in line to buy my ticket.  as someone brought up on wartime newsreels and propaganda films during wwii, i had an avid interest in exploring the realities of that conflict as reflected in the memoirs and stories of men who were there in person. that extended later to a keen willingness over the years to buy any book on the subject, and eventually to read the equally compelling novels of hans helmut kirst and erich maria remarque, which provided an even deeper sensibility. the movie versions, however, were unlike this one in that they rarely delivered the goods.  the medium of black-and-white film has never been served so well as it was in those years. i have never seen any technicolor version of war that seems as authentic as do the deep chiaroscuros of films like ""the wooden horse."" if it is true that we are destined always to be captive to the images of our childhood, then i confess it freely.  and there will never be another the likes of leo genn as the emblematic british war hero on film. not even sir alec.",1
"i enjoyed this film. i thought it was an excellent political thriller about something that's never happened before - a secret service agent going bad and involved in an assassination plot. unfortunately, for michael douglas' character, ""pete garrison,"" they think he's the mole but he isn't.   he's just a morally-flawed agent having an affair with the first lady! since he's doing that, he's unable to give an acceptable polygraph exam and that makes him suspect number one when it's revealed there is a plot to kill the president.  ""garrison"" is forced to go on the lam but at the same time he's still trying to do the right thing by protecting the president. douglas does a fine job in this role. i don't always care the people he plays but he's an excellent actor. keifer sutherland (""david breckinridge"") is equally as good (at least in here) as the fellow ss boss who hunts down douglas until convinced he has been telling the truth. when he does the two of them work together in the finale to discover and then stop, if they can, the plot. the crooks are interesting, too, by the way. also, i have never - and never will, unfortunately - see a first lady who looks as good as kim basinger  this is simply a slick action flick that entertains start-to-finish. are there holes in it? of course; probably a number of them, and a reason you see so many critical comments. however, it is unfairly bashed here. it just isn't intelligent enough for the geniuses here on this website. my advice: chill, just go along for the ride and enjoy all the action and intrigue. yes, it gets a little rambo-ish at the end but otherwise it gets high marks for entertainment.....which is what movies are all about.",1
"what a sad sight these tv stalwarts make, running out the clock on their careers stumbling about a little rusting hulk of a ship - boat might be more appropriate. the whole production feels cheap and shabby, and it's not helped by a ""big name"" star who is barely capable of spitting out the few lines that he's given in a credible fashion.  at no time do the supporting cast rise above the material; they're clearly watching the clock here. bang out the scenes, get the pay cheque, go home, and try to forget all about it.  it's not particularly badly scripted or filmed; there are no real clangers, it's just utterly anodyne, and shot in a very limited number of cramped sets with a small cast of extras. the pacing is a little bizarre; an embarrassingly tentative romantic sub-plot is only begun after the main action starts, which makes it feel irrelevant.  maiden voyage scores a couple of points for being competently scored, and for being a fun game of ""spot the kiwi bit parters""; most of the cast are graduates of shortland street or xena: warrior princess. the saddest thing about this production is that this film probably constitutes their big break.",0

"recently, a friend and i were discussing educational and ethical influences when we were growing up in the 1950's versus today. she mentioned samuel taylor coleridge, who, in 1798, wrote the rime of the ancient mariner. both of us had been required to recite parts of the epic poem in high school and in english literature courses in college. my friend said, ""its messages even might be called metaphysical within today's context.""   we tried reciting it and only remembered bits and pieces. (i have problems remembering dr. seuss.) i said i'd get two copies of the poem so each could read it. that was easy enough, but i was extremely surprised to find it had been made into a film. we looked forward to watching the film to see how it had been interpreted. after all, the rime of the ancient mariner isn't exactly light reading. after each had read the poem, we watched the film together.  we considered the film a remarkable achievement, especially considering it was made in the 1970's, before computers, before the so-called ""ken burns effect,"" and before special effects too often began compensating for a lack of substance. particularly noteworthy are the 19th and 20th century illustrations culled from ""lesser known artists,"" such as willy pogany, the early hollywood designer.   the film is narrated by sir michael redgrave, whom had taught the poem when he was a schoolmaster, adding a tone of authority and credibility in remaining true to the poem.   its mastery is in the layers of subtle messages, conveyed without ""instructing,"" or becoming an oppressive and obvious morality tale. we found it such a refreshing change from today's 'in your face' and 'clobber them over the head' mentality. most of today's morality messages in film are two-dimensional: extreme violence, murder and mayhem mark the bad. the bad are really, really, bad, and good are super heroes. it is as if human character lacked any nuance. the rime of the ancient mariner is a celebration of the individual, of character, of an appreciation for celebrating all the richness life has to offer, within the larger context of humanity, i.e., man's capacity to give to others.   proud of ourselves for having found this ""unknown"" gem, we then learned it had won the top award in its category five out of six times at ""name"" international film festivals. another surprise was learning the film's director, raul dasilva, is a recognized authority on early animation, and authored six award winning books about film.   this film's message is just as relevant today, if not more so, than when coleridge penned the original epic poem and when raul dasilva translated it to film. if i still was teaching high school, which i did for five years, i'd grab this one and show it to all my students. there's a level of richness here that naturally leads to discussion about the big and important issues all of us face, whether in 1798, 1978, or today--in fact, as long as humanity has a spiritual component.  highly recommended.",1
"the movie starts off in a classroom setting where not surprisingly, our main actress, orked was seen in a chinese language class. later in the film, she was asked on why (by mukhsin) that she was sent to learn mandarin. her answer was simple for a child she is; coz she's already known the malay language well.  it's a bit of a romance one may thought of it, but once you've stopped yourself from reading too much critics and go for it, you'll notice the typical elements of malaysia. the movie basically focuses on 10 year old orked who met 12 year old mukhsin in a game of which many would think of it as a boy's game. running out of players, mukhsin (who was new in that village) was forced to allow orked into the game, in which she eagerly showed the male side of her. orked is no such ordinary girl as she depicts more of the male behavior as you will see in the movie, defending mukhsin from much violent encounter with her school-bullies, throwing one of the bully's bag out from the school bus window, throwing punches and kicks on mukhsin's brother where after he teased mukhsin and so on and so forth. both were awesome buddies, and stick closer than that, but with a slightest of misunderstanding in which most of us would all respond to in the same way, parted the both of them until the day when mukhsin left town.  now the movie depicts the first love between orked and mukhsin, they started out as friends, but slowly evolving into somewhat more of a closer relationship and then towards bgr. you would notice, the changes yasmin made in the movies for each of the main actor and the actress when they go through love. the different character was portrayed with eagerness and mild humor. the scenes were all in random but it depicted so much reality in it that you'd be stuck on the screen for a long time. you will love the movie for what it is, and not because that you want to be patriotic to the local scenes, coz it means much more.  as the movie envelopes around the two love birds, it also manages to find its lens towards orked's parents, her mother who was educated in england, speaks very good english and in which, her husband and the caretaker in the house with very much attempt tries to speak back their own kind of english, which was humor all the way indeed. let me just explain to you why humor can be such a prominent thing in this movie. and that explanation or description that you may portray can be given in only one word and that is randomness. often more than not, we don't learn to laugh at ourselves, and when we do, we do it at the expense of others. it is just like what the movie just follow law by jack neo would have mentioned - often when we are ourselves, we don't see the person in us we are, but when only when we are in another person's body, then only would we learn to see who we really are. and that is how humor applies as well, more so than just dignity.  the movie was filled with such randomness that the typical facts of our routine lives as we carried it out could be all the way filled with laughter if we want it to be.  the other focus of this movie was on how orked's neighbor, a couple in which the husband is no longer loving to his wife, and wanted to find another. pak koboi as what he's nicked after was seen polishing his motorbike daily and would take it out for a ride with his newly found girlfriend. the producer did not fail to show you perhaps why the husband wanted to find another wife. the wife was a real hurler or kpc as we chinese would call it, having interrupting on other people's business and sending her own daughter to tease orked in words only adults would use. after all, what goes around, comes around, and that's probably why bad things kinda want to happen to her. in every time, being nice to people around you won't hurt at all, unless you have an ego to protect, but then again, what's it worth? the movie also centers around mukhsin's brother, hussein who would go out to town everyday until very late at night, smoking, drinking, and also finding 'girls'. he's the total opposite of mukhsin, but that's all perhaps because of family problems. both the brothers were staying with their aunt and the parents were far away from them. i will not reveal more of the story line as it would spoil much of the interest in wanting to find it out for yourself, but the slightest of all elements in which the producer wanted to send a message across to the viewers is the life of us all. she wanted us, me at least to view life from our own perspective when we are not ourselves. movies in a way, take us out from our own body, places us in the character's position, and use our empty mind then to view on the happenings of it. depending on the type and genre of the movie, you will be mesmerized by how a good movie such as this would portray and imply a significant impact on you.",1

"""film noir"" is an overused expression when it comes to describing films. every crime drama seems to be a ""noir"". but ""where the sidewalk ends"" really is a good example of what the genre is all about.  very briefly, an overzealous detective (andrews) accidentally kills a no-goodnik who works for the mobsters. the killing is blamed on the father (tom tully) of a woman andrews meets and falls for (tierney). to save dad from old sparky, andrews captures the rest of the mob and turns himself in.  the morally guilty cop is driven by impulses from the past. his father was a thief who was killed trying to shoot his way out of jail. but that doesn't excuse his actions after he accidentally offs the no-goodnik in self defense. he immediately goes to the phone to report the incident but he hesitates. he's already in hot water with the department and this could finish his career. then, at just the wrong moment, the phone rings. it's andrews' partner and andrews tells him the suspect they're trailing isn't at home. he hides the body and later disposes of it by slugging a watchman and dumping the body in the river.  what motivates a guy to do something so dumb? okay. his job was at risk. but now he's committed multiple felonies. at least i think they must be multiple. i counted obstruction of justice, assault, disposing of a body without a permit, littering, first-degree mopery, and bearing false witness against his neighbor.  in the end, we don't know whether to root for andrews or not. the suspect didn't deserve to die, true, but it was after all an accident because andrews didn't know he was a war hero and ""had a silver plate in his head."" maybe it's that kind of ambiguity that made noir what it was, among other things such as characteristic lighting. if noir involved nothing more than black-and-white photography, murder, criminals, mystery, and suspicious women, then we'd have to include all the charlie chan movies under that rubric.  andrews is pretty good. he's a kind of mark macpherson (from ""laura"") gone bitter. he never laughs, and rarely smiles, even when seated across a restaurant table from gene tierney, a situation likely to prompt smiles in many men. he has no sense of humor at all. his few wisecracks are put-downs. when he shoves a stoolie into a cab and the stoolie says, ""careful. i almost hit my head,"" andrews' riposte is, ""that's okay. the cab's insured."" andrews could seem kind of wooden at times but this is a role that calls for stubborn and humorless determination and he handles it well. his underplaying is perfect for the part. little twitches or blinks project his thoughts and emotional states. and i guess the director, otto preminger, stopped him from pronouncing bullet as ""boo-let"" and police as ""poe-lice."" never could make up my mind about gene tierney. she does alright in the role of tom tully's daughter, a model, but she's like marilyn monroe in that you can't separate the adopted mannerisms from the real personality traits. did tierney actually have such an innocent, almost saintly persona? when she answered the phone at home, did her voice have the same sing-along quality that it has on screen? poor tierney went through some bad psychiatric stuff, before there were any effective meds for bipolar disorder. and andrews too, nice guy though he appears to have been, slipped into alcoholism before finally recovering and making public service announcements.  the dvd commentary by peter muller is unpretentious, informed, and sometimes amusing.  anyway, this is a good film as well as a good example of film noir. the good guys aren't all good, although the bad guys are all bad. maybe that ambiguity is what makes it an adult picture instead of a popcorn movie. for the kiddies, only one shot is fired on screen and nobody's head explodes. sorry.",1

"young mr. lincoln marks the first film of the director/star collaboration of john ford and henry fonda. i recall years ago fonda telling that as a young actor he was understandably nervous about playing abraham lincoln and scared he wouldn't live up to the challenge.  john ford before the shooting starts put him at ease by saying he wasn't going to be playing the great emancipator, but just a jack-leg prairie lawyer. that being settled fonda headed a cast that john ford directed into a classic film.  this is not a biographical film of lincoln. that had come before in the sound era with walter huston and a year after young mr. lincoln, raymond massey did the pulitzer prize winning play by robert sherwood abe lincoln in illinois. massey still remains the definitive lincoln.  but as ford said, fonda wasn't playing the great emancipator just a small town lawyer in illinois. the film encompasses about 10 years of lincoln's early life. we see him clerking in a general store, getting some law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cross again later in the story. and his romance with ann rutledge with her early death leaving lincoln a most melancholy being.  fast forward about 10 years and lincoln is now a practicing attorney beginning to get some notice. he's served a couple of terms in the legislature, but he's back in private practice not really sure if politics is for him.  this is where the bulk of the action takes place. the two sons of that family he'd gotten the law books from way back when are accused of murder. he offers to defend them. and not an ordinary murder but one of a deputy sheriff.   the trial itself is fiction, but the gambit used in the defense of richard cromwell and eddie quillan who played the two sons is based on a real case lincoln defended. i'll say no more.  other than the performances, the great strength of young mr. lincoln is the way john ford captures the mood and atmosphere and setting of a small illinois prairie town in a fourth of july celebration. it's almost like you're watching a newsreel. and it was the mood of the country itself, young, vibrant and growing.  fans of john ford films will recognize two musical themes here that were repeated in later films. during the romantic interlude at the beginning with fonda and pauline moore who played ann rutledge the music in the background is the same theme used in the man who shot liberty valance for vera miles. and at a dance, the tune lovely susan brown that fonda and marjorie weaver who plays mary todd is the same one fonda danced with cathy downs to, in my darling clementine at the dance for the raising of a church in tombstone.   lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and dramatists because of two reasons, i believe. the first is he's the living embodiment of our own american mythology about people rising from the very bottom to the pinnacle of power through their own efforts. in fact young mr. lincoln very graphically shows the background lincoln came from. and secondly the fact that he was our president during the greatest crisis in american history and that he made a singularly good and moral decision to free slaves during the civil war, albeit for some necessary political reasons. his assassination assured his place in history.  besides fonda and others i've mentioned special praise should also go to fred kohler, jr. and ward bond, the two town louts, kohler being the murder victim and bond the chief accuser. also donald meek as the prosecuting attorney and alice brady in what turned out to be her last film as the pioneer mother of cromwell and quillan. and a very nice performance by spencer charters who specialized in rustic characters as the judge.  for a film that captures the drama and romance of the time it's set in, you can't do better than young mr. lincoln.",1

"its time to pay tribute to the great charton heston after his recent passing but this film is not the one. his other films of a past generation were ben hur, the ten commandents, omega man and planet of the apes were his better works.  this film made in 1973 attempts to prophesies a future earth , in 2022, that is so overpopulated that the human race has been manipulated by authorities to eat a universally produced food product called ""soylent green"" which is manufactured with human flesh. this bizarre and implausible film was as ridiculous at the time of its release as it is now and assumes india's population which would be about 2 billion by that stage would be then meat eaters without knowing it.  charlton heston's character this supers secret international conspiracy that world powers have concocted to meet the nutritional demands of overpopulation by using cannibalism.  unfortunately for the producers of this film the green message they deliver is not the greens party of today's ethos thank god. cannibalism was practiced by the indigenous populations in new zealand , fiji and borneo up until only 40 years before this film was made but has been long abandoned by human civilization.  another silly prediction in the film is that women become quasi sex slaves turning back the tide of radical feminism which was on the rise in 1972 when this film was made.  the film was stupid then and is as silly now but does contain a very unmemorable last film performance by the late and great edward g. robinson but still no a valid reason to revisit the film other than for academic reasons.  this is a dud of a film and i wouldn't even recommend it to baby boomers or charlton heston fans. all the other reviews of this film i have read all sound the same referring to a dystopian society in the future of which the centralised theme only seems to involve the usa in which an ecological disaster has occurred.  the only merit in the film is that earth does face overpopulation.",1

"a man and his wife get in a horrible car accident. when the wife is left in a persistent vegetative state, the man must choose between pulling the plug and letting her live. the decision is made even harder when he realizes her ghost wants to extract revenge on him and those around him.  this comes to us from director rob schmidt, who made ""wrong turn"" (a film i have not seen). with only one horror film under his belt, and not a particularly notorious one at that, i was a bit reluctant to watch this episode, expecting schmidt to be a ""master of horror"" in only the most liberal sense. my apologies to him for my underestimation. as of episode 10 in a 13 episode season, this was actually the best one yet.  the issue of the ""right to die"" is dealt with and covered in enough detail to be a solid plot device. however, this is only the foundation on which the story revolves. once the horror elements show up, the film goes from ""decent"" to ""spectacular"". great acting, great plot, great dialogue, great suspense. i was a little creeped out at times (which is good) and most of all: the gore is in extreme abundance! i read a review of this episode prior to watching it, where the reviewer said there is a strong hint of ""hellraiser"" in this. through the first part of the show, i had no idea what they were talking about. then there is a bit later where some images do remind me of ""hellraiser 2"". however, i in no way wish to say that this takes away from the film. i can see no other way to create the effect that was created, and in my opinion this looks remarkably better than ""hellraiser 2"".  some plot twists show up later on, and might invite the viewer to give the film a second look. i didn't watch it a second time, but i think the beginning would make more sense if i had (not that it's confusing). the subplot with the dental hygienist is also nice, and i found myself going back and forth about whether i disliked the main character for his relationship with her or if i felt bad for him. he's somewhat of an anti-hero to the whole story, if you will. i feel inclined to cheer for him as the protagonist, but he's completely unlovable.  while the stuart gordon episode may be better and i'm excited about the ""washingtonians"" episode, i think i could safely bet that this is the key episode of the season and by far the saving grace of what was otherwise lackluster and routine. when legends like john carpenter let me down (again) i get a bit worried about the genre's future, but then a fresh face like rob schmidt comes along and gives me hope. this one is a keeper, and please bring schmidt back for season 3!",1

"if another hitler ever arises, it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film, which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start. far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land, sane people would cross the street to avoid him, and he would have died in a ditch, nameless and unknown.  anyone who reads the accounts of hitler's close companions - the autobiography of his secretary traudl junge for instance - will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly, intelligent, generous man. he was also a brilliant orator, and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and ranting to modern ears ignores the times in which they were made, when strutting pomposity was common in political speeches. ditto the overstated anti-semitism, which was neither a central plank of the early nazis - who were primarily anti-communist - nor uncommon or unusual for the times. the film makes it look as though hitler's sole ambition from the start was the holocaust.  if you want to identify the next person who will cause the death of tens of millions, you can ignore fleck-lipped ravers life the one portrayed here. look instead for a charming, charismatic man whose compelling speeches inspire the entire nation, and whose political work visibly and materially benefits the country. i'm afraid his personality will be much more like barack obama's than fred phelps'.  i hoped for much here, and got nothing but caricature. the fools who made this thing perpetrated a crime against reality. this is the historical equivalent of 'reefer madness'.",0

"this early adam sandler film could be compared to his life as a comic during the same period in 1989. his character's constant acknowledgement of his hidden comic genius and frustration regarding humorous material seems to come more from sandler than the script. the film is nothing compared to his blockbuster feature films, such as big daddy or even the corny billy maddison. unfortunately, sandler had not yet found a way to express himself in a consistent, successful and funny manner when this film was made, much like his character. the majority of the film's ""jokes"" come from sandler having conversations with himself, usually over his unrecognised comic talent and beating himself up because he's too ugly and can't get women. the film is hard to watch too because it doesn't treat itself like a real film. sandler talks to the camera and the viewers throughout the film, often referring to the film's low budget or questionable content. the film is ultimately awkward and embarrassing to watch. i immediately wanted to forget i even saw this film after it was over, for fear that if more found out about it, it would ruin sandler's career. pass this one up at the video store, i rented it for free and it was still a waste of time.",0

"this is the first 10 out of 10 that i've given any movie. what made this movie so good for me? constant action - there isn't any slow parts, great acting, smart writing. i also liked the filming style where the shakiness and different angles just made it feel like you are a part of the scene. finally, i get to see an action movie that doesn't try to please all sectors of the public (i.e. there's no forced romance).  i liked the first two bourne movies, but i loved this one.  warning - after watching this movie, you will be full of adrenaline and you may want to calm down a bit before driving your car!",1
"i'm a big fan of b5, having caught on only at the end of season three. i faithfully watched all the previous seasons when it was syndicated, concluding that it was one of the most well-thought out story arcs to ever hit television. even the filler episodes were interesting. the movies, also, were well produced and as entertaining as anything to hit the theaters.  which brings us to 'river of souls'. naturally, after seeing everything else, i had high expectations. martin sheen appears to be acting in an ed wood movie rather than a serious sci-fi story. the story itself, might have looked good in outline form, even made it to the story board. however, it suffers obviously when it came time to filling this notion out into a two hour movie. there are no special effects to keep us entertained in the total absence of a compelling story. there are places where they were obviously short of time and just improvised the dialog to fill the story out. had this made the regular season, it would have rated among the worst of the episodes.",0

"if, like me, you like your films to be unique, and unlike the majority of other movies, then i wholly recommend that you check out the beast. the film is a grotesque, erotic, fantasy fairytale that centres around a mythological 'beast' that is rumoured to wander the grounds of a french mansion and lusts after women. the film is very daring with it's subject material, and that is something to give it credit for. the theme of bestiality is a definite taboo, and for good reason, i might add; but the film conveys it; straight and to the point. like other films that handle a taboo subject at their centre, the beast could have gone around it, and made us use our imagination to fill in the gaps, but borowczyk didn't do that, and he is brave in that respect, especially as making a film like this will leave him open to all kinds of criticisms, but the fact that he went ahead with it, in my view, means a big thumbs up for the guy.  the film starts off with a sequence that sees a randy male horse mount a female. this opener puts an exclamation mark on the film and prepares the audience, in some ways, for the incredible, tour de force of eroticism that they are about to see. the scenes which see the beast mate with the woman are gratuitous and shocking, and are bound to offend many people (hence the reason it was banned for over 20 years), but these scenes are not merely an excuse for borowczyk to shock the viewer; this film has a defining point. as said during the film; the only difference between man and beast is intelligence. both man and beast have instincts, only man knows how to control them. the beast explores this difference between man and beast through sexuality; the fantasy sequence in which the beast appears epitomises the control of human desire, and it is only when the central female character lets go of her control that she can see the beast. the film has strong themes of the age-old story of 'beauty and beast' weaved into it, and overall this is a shockingly morbid tale of lust, but not without a moral.  many criticise the scenes around the film's shocking sex sequences for being boring, but these scenes are important to the film's story. without these scenes, we wouldn't get to know the characters or the story of the beast, and, most importantly; the story of 'beauty and the beast' would not be able to have it's horrifying conclusion dealt to the audience, and as that is one of the key elements of the film; it would be a real shame. besides that, borowczyk keeps his audience entertained through these scenes, not with shocks, but with dialogue and the upper class persona of the family, along with the beautiful shots of the mansion's ground would not be seen, and therefore the stark contrast between that and the events later on in the film would not exist either.  overall, the beast is a shocking film. it's portrayal of a taboo subject and the shocking way it is portrayed will ensure that this film is not for everyone. however, if you can get over the film's shock, and embrace the beast; what awaits is a skilful and beautiful piece of art that should not be missed by anyone that is willing to give this film a chance.",1
"years ago, when i was a poor teenager, my best friend and my brother both had a policy that the person picking the movie should pay. and, while i would never pay to see some of the crap they took me to, i couldn't resist a free trip to the movies! that's how i came to see crap like the second conan movie and never say never again! now, despite this being a wretched movie, it is in places entertaining to watch--in a brain dead sort of way. and, technically the stunts and camera-work are good, so this elevates my rating all the way to a 2! so why is the movie so bad? well, unlike the first rambo movie, this one has virtually no plot, rambo himself only says about 3 words (other than grunts and yells), there is a needless and completely irrelevant and undeveloped ""romance"" and the movie is one giant (and stupid) special effect. and what stupifyingly awful special effects. while 12383499143743701 bullets and rockets are shot at rambo, none have any effect on him and almost every bullet or arrow rambo shoots hits its mark! and, while the bad guys are using ak-47s, helicopters and rockets, in some scenes all rambo had is a bow and arrows with what seem like nuclear-powered tips!! the scene where the one bad guy is shooting at him as he slowly and calmly launches one of these exploding arrows is particularly made for dumb viewers! it was wonderfully parodied in uhf starring weird al. plus, hot shots, part deux also does a funny parody of the genre--not just this stupid scene.  all-in-all, a movie so dumb and pointless, it's almost like self-parody!",0

"a rousing adventure form director george stevens (before he would turn to more serious fare such as 1948's i remember mama and 1956's giant) that set the standard for all future action yarns to follow. loosely based on rudyard kipling's poem of the same, gunga din follows the journey of three military officers in 19th century india. the noble trio must brave a series of battles and other various dangers including a thuggee cult and a temple full of gold. their screen adventures remain thrilling even after more than six decades, and have lent inspiration to nearly everything from the cliffhanger-inspired space opera star wars (1977) to the similarly-plotted raiders of the lost arc (1981).  the biggest reason for the picture's success, however, is the pitch-perfect performances by the film's trio of extremely charismatic actors. victor mclaglen has rarely been better as the strapping tough guy, cary grant is the ultimate comic foil, and douglas fairbanks, jr is as suave a swashbuckling hero as imaginable - perhaps even more so than rival errol flynn. the chemistry between the three actors simply could not be improved upon, and such warm and believable comradely is precisely what's missing from most modern action pictures - and they receive tremendous support from the marvelous sam jaffe, who overcomes the obvious physical miscasting and makes the title character a beacon of humane sweetness and quiet strength. a huge hit in its day (the film was reportedly the second-biggest money maker of 1939 behind the outrageously successful gone with the wind), and it remains arguably the best film of its kind.",1
"eva (hedy lamarr) has just got married with an older man and in the honeymoon, she realizes that her husband does not desire her. her disappointment with the marriage and the privation of love, makes eva returning to her father's home in a farm, leaving her husband. one afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and an young worker retrieves and gives them back to eva. they fall in love for each other and become lovers. later, her husband misses her and tries to have eva back home. eva refuses, and fortune leads the trio to the same place, ending the affair in a tragic way. i have just watched ""extase"" for the first time, and the first remark i have is relative to the horrible quality of the vhs released in brazil by the brazilian distributor video network: the movie has only 75 minutes running time, and it seems that it was used different reels of film. there are some parts totally damaged, and other parts very damaged. therefore, the beauty of the images in not achieved by the brazilian viewer, if he has a chance to find this rare vhs in a rental or for sale. the film is practically a silent movie, the story is very dated and has only a few lines. consequently, the characters are badly developed. however, this movie is also very daring, with the exposure of hedy lamarr beautiful breasts and naked fat body for the present standards of beauty. another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphoric used of flowers, symbolizing the intercourse between eva and her lover. the way the director conducts the scenes to show the needs and privation of eva is very clear. the non-conclusive end is also very unusual for a 1933 movie. i liked this movie, but i hope one day have a chance to see a 87 minutes restored version. my vote is eight.  title (brazil): ""êxtase"" (""ecstasy"")",1

"this film is another of director tim burton's attempts to capitalize on a familiar title to bring his `vision' to the screen. he has done it with `batman', `sleepy hollow' and now this. this is not a remake. the only thing it has in common with the original is that it has simians that can speak (and charleton heston makes a cameo). burton has reconstituted the entire story, watering it down for today's mass viewership.  the original planet of the apes was a product of its time. during the 1960's america was struggling to redefine its civilization. it was a turbulent time of soul searching and rethinking social norms. it was the civil rights era where groups long considered inferior demanded to be treated as equal. in that context, pota was allegorical, reflecting the philosophical turmoil confronting the audiences of the day. pota was an extremely intelligent film that broached difficult questions and elegantly held the oppressions of american society up to scrutiny by making the white guy justify his intelligence to a species he considered inferior. the dialectic between colonel taylor (charleton heston), dr. cornelius (roddy mcdowall) and dr. zira (kim hunter) was thought provoking and intelligent with ironies both subtle and obvious.  burton's version is as much a product of today's times as pota was of the sixties. this is apes for dummies. it is superficial and jejune, substituting politically correct platitudes for intelligent dialogue and focusing more on form than substance. the `surprise' ending is utterly incongruous and contributes nothing to the film except a cliffhanger that sets up the sequel. while the ending of the original pota gracefully tied everything together in a single powerful scene, burton's ending simply mocks the audience, taunting, `i know something you don't know, and you are going to have to wait for the sequel to find out.'  from a technical perspective, as is always the case with burton's film, the film is excellent. the makeup is fantastic and burton's camerawork is outstanding (though i continue to dislike his dark look). however, thirty-three years of advancements in prosthetic makeup can not compensate for the insultingly vacuous script.  the story has been reduced to a monster movie. the humans band together behind captain davidson (mark wahlberg) to fight the monstrous apes, aided and abetted by a few turncoats (notably helena bonham carter as ari). the presentation is formulaic and simplistic with plenty of violence, perfect for today's fast food mentality.  the acting is mixed. mark wahlberg is a fine actor who is simply miscast in this role. walberg is excellent at playing dark, sullen characters that are tormented but strong. this part requires an inspirational hero, a profile not in wahlberg's repertoire. helena bonham carter is a brilliant actor whose character is so far beneath her ability that the disconnect is laughable. she tries desperately to do something with the flimsy character, but her interpretation presents like a cross between a college peace demonstrator and love sick teenager.  then there is tim roth. his is a virtuoso performance, single-handedly saving the film from total ruin. roth is diabolically hateful as the malevolent general thade. he creates one of the most villainous and despicable bad guys i can remember in some time. additionally, his physical acting is superlative, rendering a chimp-man that is such a perfect meld that one can almost believe that the species exists.  this film is a great disappointment. it is decent entertainment, as long as you check your brain at the door. i rated it a 3/10. from a technical perspective it is much better than that, perhaps a 9/10. however the story is an insult to the original franchise. it is simply another attempt by burton at self adulation, using a familiar title to attract throngs to the box office so lots of people can see what a genius he is. of course it's true, but it would be great if he used that talent to produce substantial films, instead of simple minded pap formulated for mass consumption.",0
"i have lost count of how many reviews i've written on slaughter high. i've read a lot of bad ones and i will say right now this is a fantastic movie. simon scuddamore made his fame in a short time for his well known suicide, and even though this was his only film, he is what made the movie so great. at first i did not know anything about simon until i read a review about his suicide. then i found out due to the current webpage at www.imdb.com he was born in 1957, in dayton, ohio. simon may have played the most pathetic character known to man, but his real life self certainly had their strenghths and weaknesses. he did a good acting job, who can disagree? i always wondered how he felt showing himself naked in a movie. must have been pretty embarrassing to say the least. i first saw this movie when i was 12 in the sixth grade. i agree with some pointers like the girl would not take a bath after somebody was murdered, and that high schools do not have bath tubs! i think caroline munro who was 36 at the time was the only other star that had any dignified acting talent, and unfortunately for simon's death he made no future films. the reason(s) for his suicide are a mystery, and hopefully will be discovered in the near future. doing the math on his webpage it tells you he was 29 years old when he made slaughter high. he looked like a teenager. i give this film two thumbs up, the best horror film made. probably because of their horrible acting the others didn't make fame in the movie business. -jacob young",1
"in 1979 lucio fulci released his film zombi. however, due to the earlier import of george romero's dawn of the dead, which had gone by that name for its italian release, it was retitled to zombi 2. (which also had the bonus of letting the audience think this was a sequel to the second romero movie). continuing this theme, the second zombi film, which would have been called zombi 2, was then consequently titled zombi 3. in the uk, the original zombi film (that is, zombi 2) was titled ""zombie flesh eaters"". to continue this theme, the second zombi film (zombi 3) was then titled ""zombie flesh eaters 2"" for its uk release. (are you following all this?) so if zombie flesh eaters was fulci's dawn, then is 2 his day of the dead? while this is only a flippant observation, this tale of military compounds, helicopters and a plodding narrative certainly does bear a vague thematic resemblance.  some of fulci's european direction compels in a film like this, but the acting, dubbing and exposition-heavy script are absolutely horrendous. its ecological message is so forced and overstated it can no longer be considered a subtext, while there's an (unintentionally) hilarious birds homage. combining this last element with mor 80s rock is not a good idea. for some reason i couldn't stop thinking of time of the apes (q.v.) the whole time i was watching this. this is obviously not a good thing.  while there's nothing here to rival topless scuba-diving, shark wrestling zombies and eyeballs on a splinter, fulci's misogynistic leanings do get a work out with a hotel cleaner's mouth being ground into a mirror until it gushes blood. his fannish gore predilections also see a hand severing. both themes are combined when a woman's face is ripped off, first by one zombie, then a zombie foetus that tears out of a pregnant woman's stomach.  production-wise, this is obviously a step up from zombi, coming five years later. (nine years in worldwide release terms). but without the original's low-key charm it struggles, while stefano mainetti's music is inappropriate and uninspired. fabio frizzi's score was one of the best things about the '79 movie. here zombie attacks are played out to what sounds unnervingly like bonnie tyler's ""holding out for a hero"". in the middle of this carnage we get an irksome love interest, and roger and kenny, two bland macho types who do everything with acrobatic urgency and constantly state the obvious. (""we're out of ammunition"" to a stalling gun is a particular standout). but where it also falls down is in the zombies themselves. low key or not, fulci's original had truly magnificent, rotting zombies. skull faces, worms in eye sockets... they really were something to behold. by contrast, this dull follow-up opts for the more traditional ""men with a bit of paint on their faces"" option.   the climax rips off too many romero movies to even be funny, while the use of the dj is a crass and cheap narrative device. not containing the same elements of outrage and gratuitous nudity of the first, this is unlikely to have the same cult appeal.   it turns out that fulci actually walked out on the project after reportedly directing just fifteen minutes, the rest filmed by bruno mattei. i'm fairly sure that even fulci would have balked at the ludicrous ""flying zombie head"" scene, and so credit to the director for having the good sense to leave. unfortunately, however, it's his name that's above the film title on releases, so the majority of people will be left with the impression that this is a fulci film through and through. on that scale then it's a major setback for him, for this movie commits what you imagine fulci would regard as the worst crime of all: that of being boring.",0
"why do movie makers always go against the author's work? i mean, yes, things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest, but look at anne of green gables. they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful. i can't believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess. look at all they missed out on by doing that . . . paul irving, little elizabeth, the widows, windy poplars . . . and anne's college years, for heaven's sake!!! wouldn't it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang? kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time, instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did. this movie was good, if you leave the novels out of it!! but l.m. montgomery's beautiful work is something that should not be denied. this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life.",0
"a group of model-caliber san francisco women who have been friends since elementary school are suddenly being threatened and attacked by someone sending them bizarre valentine's day cards. who is the killer and why is the killer after them?   my rating will often change on subsequent viewings of a film--sometimes slightly up, sometimes slightly down. however, i can't remember another film where my rating has changed as drastically as it has for valentine. the first time i watched it, upon its theatrical release, i thought it was pretty awful--i gave it a 4 out of 10, the equivalent of an ""f"" letter grade. watching it for a second time last night, i can't remember what the heck i didn't like about it. i can only assume that maybe i was really in the wrong mood to watch it, or maybe i just didn't get it. in any event, i loved it this time, giving it a 9 out of 10, or an ""a"".  it might sound ridiculous saying i didn't get a film like this, but there is something to get. valentine is almost a comedy/horror. director jamie blanks, who was also responsible for 1998's urban legend, takes the stereotypical teen horror formula that became so popular in the late 1990s in the wake of scream (1996) and pushes most of the elements up a notch, making valentine intentionally cheesy/campy almost to the point of absurdity (where absurdism is a positive stylistic term). on top of that, he gives us a film imbued with humorous commentary on romantic relationships. the humor is unusual in that it has the same exaggeratedly campy tone as the teen horror aspects. most of the situations in the film, and the modus operandi of the villain, humorous or not, are tied in to the valentine's day theme.  many viewers will likely subtract points from the film for its various cliché-rooted but implausible scenarios and plot developments. however, in light of the above, the film is intentionally clichéd, implausible and ludicrous. it's as if blanks is attempting (and mostly succeeding) to transcend the typical teen slasher by mocking/spoofing the conventions of the genre while also satirizing eros. that's the attraction to the irony of basing a horror film on valentine's day. it's an incongruity that is cleverly woven throughout the film, and that is itself at the heart of the slasher genre, making it prime fodder for valentine's extravagant lampooning. scream had a similar aim with its horror material, but the twist there was that the film was ""self-aware"". valentine's day is intentionally not self-aware; the viewer has to rely on contextual clues for satire. lest some think i'm ""reading too much"" into the film, it's worthwhile to note that blanks said in interviews that he ""didn't want to just do another slasher film after urban legend"" and producer dylan sellers said he wanted to do something ""more adult"".  other viewers may dislike the fact that valentine's day differs so much from its putative source material, the novel of the same name by tom savage. the novel's characters, setting and plot are very different from the film. sellers has said, ""while it was a fine book, i didn't think it was the right story for a film"". so instead the novel, which is much dryer and more serious in tone, was used as a launching pad, a motif to create variations on for a horror/thriller story centered on valentine's day. while those facts won't help purists familiar with the book like the film, it's helpful to understand why the film has its divergent plot and attitude. it's probably better to look at the film as an independent entity with a similar theme.  blanks' direction is impeccable visually. valentine's day has a lush look throughout, with complex, deep colors, interesting sets, and good staging. blanks is admirable for keeping his villain and attack scenes not too dark, with clearly conveyed action. he also directs his actors with aplomb, catalyzing often slyly humorous performances. david boreanaz, as adam carr, is involved in many of the funniest moments.  while valentine's day is no masterpiece, it's a very good horror/thriller film that seems strongly prone to misconceptions. if you watch it expecting something more tongue-in-cheek you may find yourself appreciating it a lot more.",1
"okay, when i came on the board for this movie, i was really expecting people to be making fun of it. i was surprised to see that people over the age of 7 liked it. i enjoyed the movie... but only b/c me and my little sister (who is, in fact only 10) made fun of the whole thing.  i am sorry jordan, but that acting was awful. you know a movie is headed for the toilet when the lead cannot act. and it didn't even have a good script or plot to redeem it. i also thought that the character of pamela was very very lame... border-lining pathetic.  even with that being said, i thought there were a few good actors, such as gorgeous spencer, hollywood, and ronnie. still, not enough to redeem the movie.  two things about this movie that i just can't get over:  1.) that that spencer guy would fall for her. okay, eww. i looked up the dates and while in reality, he is only about four years older than her, the difference in ""go figure"" seemed much larger. jordan is a very pretty girl, but in gf, she seemed like 10 or 12... she seemed like a little kid! jake abel (spencer) seemed like a college student.  2.) that there is any way that kristi yamaguchi would come just to skate for one girl. i mean, i know that katelin is good and everything, but it still just seemed kinda unlikely that kristi would go to a boarding school that didn't even have scholarships for skating, or that a school would have employed a skating coach with such connections.  that all being said... it wasn't the worst movie ever known, but it wasn't very good even by dcom standards, which i consider quite low.",0
"this first-rate western tale of the gold rush brings great excitement, romance, and james stewart to the screen. ""the far country"" is the only one out of all five stewart-mann westerns that is often overlooked. stewart, yet again, puts a new look on the ever-present personalities he had in the five stewart-mann westerns. jeff webster (stewart) is uncaring, always looking out for himself, which is why he is so surprised when people are nice and kindly to him. ironically, he does wear a bell on his saddle that he will not ride without. this displays that he might just care for one person- his sidekick, ben tatum, played by walter brennan, since tatum is the one that gave it to him. mann, yet again, puts a new look on the ever present personalities he put into the five stewart-mann westerns. he displays violence, excitement, plot twists, romance, and corruption. the story is that jeff and ben, through a series of events, wind up in the get rich quick town of dawson, along with gold partners calvet and flippen, and no-good but beautiful roman and her hired men. they are unable to leave, because crooked sheriff mr. gannon (mcintire) and his ""deputies"" will hang them, since the only way out is through skagway, which is gannon's town. but, eventually, mcintire comes to them, but not to collect stewart and/or his fine that he supposedly owes to the government. what is mcintire there for? he is there to cheat miners out of their claims and money. people are killed. a sheriff for dawson is considered needed, and calvet elects stewart because he is good with a gun. stewart, however, refuses the job, because he plans to get all the gold he can, and then pull out. he also refuses it because he does not like to help people, since law and order always gets somebody killed. so, flippen is elected instead. a miner is killed because he tries to stand up to one of gannon's men, a purely evil, mustachioed fancy gunman named madden, who carries two guns, played by wilke. flippen attempts to arrest madden and see that justice be done, but he cannot stand up to him, so he becomes the town drunk. a man named yukon replaces flippen. stewart and tatum start to pull out, but are ambushed by gannon's men. tatum is killed, and stewart is wounded. stewart finally realizes that he must do something, or gannon will take over dawson, set up his own rules, and it will become his town, just like skagway. the audience also realizes what stewart must do. another thing that the audience realizes is that stewart is the only thing that stands between the townspeople and gannon. if stewart leaves, gannon would take over the town. if stewart stays and keeps on not doing anything about it, the townspeople will be killed one by one mercilessly and uselessly. this is where a great scene occurs. stewart walks into his cabin. he has a sling on his arm. for a few seconds, his gun, in the gunbelt, is hanging on a post beside his bed, the gun is close up, stewart is in the background, just inside the door. he stares at it for a few seconds. he tosses the sling away. the sling lands on the back of a chair, and falls to the floor. this is symbolic, because he is throwing away his old life, which consisted of not caring about anybody but himself. he comes into his new life, of helping people when they need help. what ends the film is a guns-blazing, furious show of good against evil, and a genuinely feel-good feeling that everything will be alright.",1
"it seems that it is becoming fashionable to rip ""basic instinct 2,"" to the point that a significant part of the audience (including critics) found it terrible even before it was released. it seems even more fashionable to trash sharon stone wholike all of usis now fourteen years older, andunlike most of usstill looks wonderful. first comments on this movie were so vicious that i had to see for myself. in my opinion, this sequel is not nearly as good as the original film, but is not as bad as most comments pretend. michael caton-jones is not paul verhoeven, neither henry bean and leora barish are joe eszterhas. ""basic instinct 2"" is just an entertaining, average thriller, and besides the addition of jerry goldsmith original score, keeps little resemblance to its predecessor. even stone gives her character a different dimension, creating a lustful, devilish catherine trimell, who can perfectly well rank among other monsters like hannibal lecter. she is an intelligent actress who is not afraid of taking risks and can play with camp at her leisure. unfortunately, she seems to be the main target for those who enjoy trashing this flick. she became too successful, too much of a main icon, and like all those actors who have reached that level, her time has arrived and she is now bound to be destroyed by hollywood audiences.  the rest of the cast is outstanding, giving performances that are far better than the material deserves. david morrissey is a much better actor and by far more interesting than michael douglas: his acting is flawless, giving a dense, complex dimension to an otherwise one dimensional character. since he has more screen time and is the axis of the movie, he can keep your attention from beginning to end.  i am not recommending ""basic instinct 2"" as a great movie; i am just expressing my disagreement with most of the comments on this site and my conviction that agendas other than the movie itself are shaping the opinion of most spectators.",1
"the first time my best friend and i sat down to watch this movie, we were watching it for alex winter of ""bill & ted's"" fame. we didn't know what to expect other than who and what it was about.  by the time the movie was over, we knew that it was love at first sight. this movie, while not completely historically accurate, was and is the best one of its genre. i have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion, none of the others can compare. it fibbed a little at certain details, but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story. i have seen the other movies about this summer and i find most of them to be good, but none as captivating as this one.  ""haunted summer"" has the qualities of a painting. the colors and settings seem to be something one would find on a canvas, framed and hung in a museum or on the walls of an eccentric's home. the costumes were gorgeous and, despite not being the most comfortable clothes in the world, made me want to find a seamstress to create such garb for myself. the whole movie was set on the picturesque lake geneva (where i hope to one day go because of seeing this movie) and the serenity that these historical figures found there.  this movie shows, besides the tranquility found by all the escapees of england's harsh judgements, the strangeness that surrounded this adventure as well. yes, there were drugs. it was a fairly common practice during that time, a time when drugs were not illegal. and the taking of laudanum (the liquid form of opium) was medicinal as well as recreational. shelley suffered from consumption. lord byron suffered the pains of a clubbed foot. it was not surprising that there would be prescriptions of the strong drugs that were in their possession during that summer. and they were poets during a time when experience was the key. there was no time for prudish caution. passion and experience were a big part of the romantic era. and out of the thoughts and discussions of science, religion and philosophy came the creation of a legend: ""frankenstein.""  yes, in this movie, we see the beautiful and liberated mary godwin (not married to shelley at that time) played by beautiful and talented alice krige. she is the control factor to all that goes on until she, too, gives in to experience. but she stands her ground and experiences things on her own terms. as was the strength that she inherited from her mother and father.  the actors and actresses in this were perfect for the parts they played. the music fitting. the direction captured the essence of the summer, as i've read about it. this movie was based on a wonderful book ""haunted summer"" by anne edwards. if you like this movie, read the book. the author takes the story from what she was able to put together from the actual journals of mary godwin shelley and the other participants of this story.  if you are a person who loves history (even the little inaccuracies from time to time) and romance and the gothic, then this is a movie for you. it shows the birth of the birth of the monster, which even today teaches us about the morals of ""playing god.""  a definite must see movie!",1
"recipe for one of the worst movies of all time: a she-male villain who looks like it escaped from the wwf, has terrible aim with a gun that has inconsistent effects (the first guy she shoots catches on fire but when she shoots anyone else they just disappear) and takes time out to pet a deer. then you got the unlikable characters, 30 year old college students, a lame attempt at a surprise ending and lots, lots more. avoid at all costs.",0
"enjoyed the movie and efficient confucian crime drama, the old order survives the threat posed by a brash young greedy man, no doubt representing modern society. i thought the final scene was strange and could not understand if we were to believe that big d was being punished for being greedy or it was part of the plan a long. i loved the scene and for once in a chinese movie, the violence was not a choreographed martial arts fest. on thing that always amuses me about hk films is that the main influence the british seem to have had is to introduce 'yes sir' and 'sorry' into the local language and its amusing that long after we have gone, they are still there.",1
"now, i've seen a lot of bad movies. i like bad movies. especially bad action movies. i've seen (and enjoyed) all of jean-claude van damme's movies, including the one where he's his own clone, both of the ones where he plays twins, and all three where he's a cyborg. i actually own the one where he plays a fashion designer and has a fight in a truck full of durians. (hey, if nothing else, he's got a great ass and you almost always get to see it. with dvd, you can even pause and zoom in!) that's why you can trust me when i say that this movie is so bad, it makes plan 9 look like citizen kane.  everything about snake eater is bad. the plot is bad. the script is bad. the sets are bad. the fights are bad. the stunts are bad. the fx are bad. the acting is spectacularly, earth-time-bendingly bad, very probably showcasing the worst performance of every so-called actor in the cast, including lorenzo lamas, and that's really saying something. and i'd be willing to bet everyone involved with this movie is lousy in bed, to boot. especially lorenzo lamas.   it does manage to be unintentionally funny, so it's not a total loss. however, i recommend that you watch this movie only if you are either a congenital idiot or very, very stoned. i was able to sit through it myself because i needed to watch something to distract me from rinsing cat urine out of my laundry.  it didn't help much, but it was better than nothing. one point for ron palillo's cameo as a gay arsonist.",0
"when i heard about ""hammerhead"" being released on dvd and finally found it at my local dvd store, i thought ""well, just another cheap monster movie from nu image"". those guys around boaz davidson and avi lerner produced cheap but very entertaining b - pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies. so i didn't expect much, especially after having watched the rather disappointing ""shark zone"" just a few days before. but ""hammerhead"" turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies. we have a mad scientist, a group of people in a dangerous situation, screaming women and damsels in distress, man-eating plants and of course we have the creature, a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark. everything you need for an entertaining monster movie. the only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind, but since the movie was made for tv it's understandable why these scenes are missing. and it doesn't matter anyway cause ""hammerhead"" is action and horror entertainment at it's best. there are two reasons why i gave it seven out of ten points, though: first of all, the monster isn't seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done, and secondly, william forsythe just isn't the right guy for the ""hero"" part and for falling in love with gorgeous hunter tylo. other than that, i can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there. grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn, watch this movie and have fun. jasper p. morgan",1
"i am appalled at how bad this film is. as a pastiche of early 20th century hollywood artistes it sets a new low - even past the moderns or (gasp) cradle will rock & i never thought i'd see a film worse than those 2. granted they were about a slightly different milieu & period. nevertheless the intents & results were distressingly similar.  first off there's the horrible casting: eddie izzard as chaplin? excuse me? peter, did you owe this guy something? jennifer tilly as loulla parsons?? kirsten dunst as marion davies??? holy smoke, these people don't even begin to try to capture the look or sound of the period they are purportedly depicting.  well, last picture show was a decent film, but this thing is a disaster & the rest of bogdonovitch's pics haven't been much better. guess rubbing up against welles & hitch & ford wore off a long time ago. still good for hosting tcm though.",0
"this was the first ppv in a new era for the wwe as hulk hogan, the ultimate warrior, ric flair and sherri martel had all left. a new crop of talent needed to be pushed. and this all started with lex luger, a former nwa world heavyweight champion being given a title shot against yokozuna. lex travelled all over the us in a bus called the lex express to inspire americans into rallying behind him in his bid to beat the japanese monster (who was actually samoan) and get the wwe championship back into american hands. as such there was much anticipation for this match.  but every good ppv needs an undercard and this had some good stuff.  the night started off with razor ramon defeating ted dibiase in a good match. the story going into this was that dibiase had picked on ramon and even offered him a job as a slave after his shock loss to the 1-2-3 kid on raw in july. ramon, angry, had then teamed with the 1-2-3 kid against the money inc tag team of ted dibiase and irwin r shyster. to settle their differences they were both given one on one matches dibiase vs ramon and shyster vs the kid. razor was able to settle his side of the deal after hitting a razor's edge.  next up came the steiner brothers putting the wwe tag team titles on the line against the heavenly bodies. depsite the interference of ""the bodies"" manager jim cornette, who hit scott steiner in the throat with a tennis racket, they were able to pull out the win in a decent match.  shawn michaels and mr perfect had been feuding since wrestlemania ix when shawn michaels confronted perfect after his loss to lex luger. perfect had then cost michaels the intercontinental championship when he distracted him in a title match against marty janetty. michaels had won the title back and was putting it on the line against mr perfect, but michaels now had a powerful ally in his corner in his 7 foot bodyguard diesel. micheals and perfect had an excellent match here, but it was diesel who proved the difference maker, pulling perfect out of the ring and throwing him into the steel steps for shawn to win by count out.  irwin r shyster avenged the loss of his tag team partner earlier in the night, easily accounting for the 1-2-3 kid.  next came one of the big matches of the night as bret hart prepared to battle jerry lawler for the title of undisputed king of the wwe. but lawler came out with crutches, saying he'd been injured in a car accident earlier that day and that he'd arranged another opponent for hart: doink the clown. hart and doink had a passable match which hart won with a sharpshooter. he was then jumped from behind by lawler. this bought wwe president jack tunney to the ring who told lawler that he would receive a lifetime ban if he didn't wrestle hart. hart then destroyed lawler, winning with the sharpshooter, but hart refused to let go of the hold and the referee reversed his decision. so after all that lawler was named the undisputed king of the wwe. this match was followed by ludvig borda destroying marty janetty in a short match.  the undertaker finished his long rivalry with harvey wippleman, which had started in 1992 when the undertaker had defeated wippleman's client kamala at summerslam and continued when wippleman's latest monster the giant gonzales had destroyed taker at the rumble and then again at wrestlemania, with a decisive victory over gonzales here. gonzales then turned on wippleman, chokeslamming him after a poor match.  next it was time for six man tag action as the smoking gunns (bart and billy) and tatanka defeated the headshrinkers (samu and fatu) and bam bam bigelow with tatanka pinning samu.  this brings us to the main event with yokozuna, flanked by jim cornette and mr fuji, putting the wwe title on the line against lex luger and it was all on board the lex express. lex came out attacking, but yokozuna took control. lex came back though as he was able to avoid a banzai drop and then body slam yokozuna before knocking him out of the ring. luger then attacked cornette and fuji as yokozuna was counted out. luger had won a fine match!!!!! balloons fell from the ceiling. the heroes all came out to congratulate him on his win. yokozuna may have retained the title, but luger had proved he could be beaten. the only question was, who could beat him in the ring and get that title off him?",1
"you think you've had it tough? you should check out this film. carl brashear is the epitome of courage and determination. what this man had to go through to become a navy diver, should be an inspiration to us all. and significantly, after seeing this film, i learned that what is shown is not even the half of it! cuba gooding, jr. does some of his best work to date as brashear. de niro, as usual is good as the southern redneck who trains him. george tillman in only his second major feature (after ""soul food""), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. if you want to be moved and inspired, you definitely need to check out this one.",1

"sex wish was actually released (minus ten minutes of more, ahem, 'extreme' footage) here in the uk back in the early days of the video boom, and caused a tabloid storm in a teacup when it allegedly inspired a copycat murder case. strangely enough, the papers brushed this ultra-disturbing flick under the carpet in their headlong rush to get the comparatively innocuous likes of frozen scream and night of the demon canned, and the film has been all but forgotten as a result. i jumped at the chance to watch it on a dvd-rw and spent most of the film's duration with my jaw on the floor. it's not so much politically incorrect as utterly demented, a triple-x take on michael winner's death wish (did the title kind of give the game away as far as inspiration was concerned?) with hardcore sex and some truly nasty violence thrown into an already bubbling brew of seventies sleaze. if you don't consider yourself to be squeamish, this may force you to think again. by the time sex wish is over, you'll want to scrub your eyeballs clean with disinfectant and take a long hot shower to purge yourself. if any film truly deserves the ""it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie"" tag-line, it's this one.  highlights (or lowlights) - a rapist using a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her, harry reems's scene-stealing moustache, the helpless young black couple who are forced to screw in front the sword cane killer (they'd have won oscars for their entirely credible performances if the academy had gone mad) before the man is castrated for his troubles, and some jarringly slick direction that threatens to lift the proceedings above their obvious grind-house origins. don't say i didn't warn you. if you thought the world was a more innocent place thirty years ago, sex wish will prove you very, very wrong.",0

"this fabulous movie must be viewed knowing that millions scraped together 10 cents to see it and forget the gloomy day-to-day economic conditions during the 30's. remember, 10 cents bought a loaf of bread back then, so this was a minor luxury for many people. it's testimony to how hollywood did its best to make the usa feel a little better about itself. you'll note that with the studio system in hollywood at the time many of the actors and actresses were type-cast in similar movies, e.g. james cagney, william powell, ruby keeler, frank mchugh, joan blondell and guy kibbee . then too, branches of the u.s. military were always respected with enthusiasm and patriotism as in the use of military precision marching by the great choreographer, busby berkeley, at the end.",1
"bruce almighty, one of carrey's best pictures since... well... a long time. it contains one of the funniest scenes i have seen for a long time too... morgan freeman plays god well and even chips in a few jokes that are surprisingly funny. it contains one or two romantic moments that are a bit boring but over all a great movie with some funny scenes. the best scene in, it is where jim is messing up the anchor man's voice.  my rating: 8/10",1
"back in the day of the big studio system, the darndest casting decisions were made. good old all american james stewart appearing as a hungarian in the shop around the corner. had i been casting the film, the part of kralik would have been perfect for charles boyer. his accent mixed in with all the other european accents would have been nothing. stewart had some of the same problem in the mortal storm also with margaret sullavan.  margaret sullavan was his most frequent leading lady on the screen, he did four films with her. but is only this one where neither of them dies. sullavan and her husband leland heyward knew stewart back in the day when he was a struggling player in new york. in fact sullavan's husband was stewart's good friend henry fonda back then.  i think only clark gable was able to carry off being an american in a cast of non-americans in mutiny on the bounty. stewart in the mortal storm was german, but all the other players were american as well so nothing stood out.   but if you can accept stewart, than you'll be seeing a fine film from ernest lubitsch. the plot is pretty simple, a man and woman working in a department store in budapest don't get along in person. but it seems that they are carrying on a correspondence with some anonymous admirers which turn out to be each other. also employer frank morgan suspects stewart wrongly of kanoodling with his wife.   though the leads are fine and frank morgan departs from his usual befuddled self, the two players who come off best are felix bressart and joseph schildkraut. bressart has my favorite moments in the film when he takes off after morgan starts asking people for opinions. he makes himself very scarce.  and joseph schildkraut, who is always good, is just great as the officious little worm who is constantly kissing up to frank morgan. you really hate people like that, i've known too many like schildkraut in real life who are at office politics 24 hours a day. sad that it pays off a good deal of the time.",1

"this could be looked at in many different ways. this movie sucks, its good or its just plain weird. the third one probably explains this movie best. it has strange themes and just has a strange plot. so who else but christopher walken would play in this no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be.  the acting was what you would expect especially out of ben stiller. jack black i have always liked so you know what you will get out of him but this is not bad. christopher walken is always off the wall. he is always enjoyable to watch no matter how bad the movie is. comedy wise it is somewhat funny. this of course meaning that it does have its moments (though very few) but can get a little over top here and there which makes me feel like the movie is just desperate for laughs but of course not in a good way.  the directing was average as well. barry levinson is a slightly overrated director and really did not do a good job here. this movie seemed that it had a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach it. just very average and did not seem like a lot of effort was put into making this film.  the writing is the key to a good comedy. obviously that means the writing here failed. at best it is below average. considering it does have its moments it was not too horrible. that is never a good thing to say about a movie though.   if not for christopher walken and it stupid ridiculous ending i would have given it a lower rating. he is always quite a character in his movies. stil this is just a whacked out strange movie with strange characters that really don't go anywhere. not completely horrible but i would not really recommend it though because it is a very forgettable movie.",0

"nothing is fantastic! simple as that! it's a film that shouldn't work, yet does. natali stays in the realm of sci-fi, however this film is also a comedy. cypher it seemed was a big budget draining affair for natali (at $7.5million! woo-hoo pa!) so with nothing he scales down again. this is low budget, independent film-making at it's best. simple, good old fashioned storytelling and an attempt at making a film for artistic merit as apposed to hollywood's usual reasons for mostly financial gain. nothing is a film about nothing and before you ask, no it is not anything like seinfeld! basically andrew and dave are a couple of losers. they live in a strange looking house beneath two freeways. andrew is a telesales travel agent who is agoraphobic while dave is andrews best mate who stays with him rent free to help him out. dave is tired of it however and has a gorgeous girlfriend who he wants to move in with. by bizarre mis-fortunes however, dave finds out his girlfriend embezzled a huge amount of money from daves work-place incriminating dave, and andrew is wrongly accused of sexually assaulting a girl scout (canadian humour people!). as it turns out andrew's house is to be demolished as well and he can't stop it happening as the house was built on land it should not have been built on. both andrew and dave are inside the house when the police and the demolition team come calling. they are desperate and can't escape, and in the panic and confusion just as the police burst in everything fades to white. what has happened? have dave and andrew died? they wake to find themselves still in the house only it is quiet. no police, no demolition team, no angry girl scout mother! what happens is dave and andy discover they have the ability to ""wish or hate away."" as it turns out they have hated away the entire outside world. they are left alone. the house is surrounded by nothing, which is portrayed as pure white. so what this means is that the films setting is a house set and then just white. the film is an interesting view on human isolation and the psyche and of course as they spend more time alone together with no food and no water, they begin to tire of each other. they discover they can hate away hunger, which is useful but obviously things get out of hand shall we say. i can't reveal much but i must say bouncing heads are quite a sight to behold.  this film is quirky, funny, interesting. the effects are simple yet effective and natali brings together two buddies from cube, david hewlett, and andrew millar to lead the film. they have chemistry and also work very well. they have to hold 90% of the movie by themselves and much of it in a pure white background, yet it works. certainly i expect this to get the same diabolical treatment as cypher did and it should appear on dvd in a year or two in the states. nothing is a top quality and unique film and although not as good as cube or cypher it once again proves natali as one of the best up and comers.  natali is someone who has really interested me in his three features so far and i cannot wait for his next feature. i prey to god he doesn't do the proposed necropolis, written and directed by add sufferer, the ever crap paul anderson. vincenzo old buddy if paul comes round to your pad, run!!! run like the wind!! i hope and prey this guy doesn't take to hollywood like alex proyas did (with the enjoyable yet pussy-footed, sugar coated, helium light: i robot!). keep your eyes peeled for this guy. ****",1
"the stock market crash of 1929 and the depression following almost ruined the american musical theater, in fact it was the final death blow to vaudeville. those behind the curtains were hit as bad as those in front.  in an effort to stimulate the show business economy and his own personal economy, out of work theater director james cagney comes up with a brilliant idea. stage live relevant prologues to the movies that are being shown at the various movie theaters that are springing up overnight from the old theaters. some other competitors get wind of it and the competition is on.  footlight parade is my favorite busby berkeley film. it gives james cagney a chance to display some of his versatility as a dancer as well as a tough guy. in his retirement cagney said that while he screened his few and far between musicals a lot, he could barely be bothered with some of his straight dramatic films. he wished he'd done a few more musicals in his career and i wish he had.  of course the staging of these busby berkeley extravaganzas on the stage of a movie palace defies all logic and reason. but it's so creative and fun to watch.   dick powell gets to sing three songs in footlight parade, ah the moon is here, honeymoon hotel, and by a waterfall, the last two with ruby keeler further cementing that screen team. ruby sings and dances with powell in the last two and she partners with james cagney in my favorite number from footlight parade, shanghai lil.   joan blondell is cagney's no nonsense girl friday at the theater. like in blonde crazy, she's the one with the real brains in that duo and it's her quick thinking that bails him out of some domestic problems he has on top of his theatrical ones. one of blondell's best screen roles.  look for dorothy lamour and ann sothern in the chorus as per the imdb pages for both of them. john garfield is seen briefly in the shanghai lil number. and in a scene at the beginning of the film, producer guy kibbee takes cagney to a movie theater where they are showing a b western starring john wayne. the duke's voice is unmistakable. but what's even more unusual is that the brief clip shows him in a scene with frank mchugh who plays another cagney assistant in footlight parade. i think the brothers warner were playing a little joke there. i've got to believe that clip was deliberate.  footlight parade is busby berkeley at his surreal best.",1
"a great suspense movie with terrific slow camera-work adding to the dramatics makes this a treat to watch and enjoy. director-writer brian de palma does a super hitchcock-imitation (many called it a ""ripoff"") with this film and the 2.35:1 widescreen dvd is a must to fully appreciate the camera-work (and several scenes with people hiding on each side which are lost on formatted-for-tv tapes).  the downside of the movie, at least to anyone that has some kind of moral standard, is the general sleaziness of all the characters, including the policeman played by a pre-nypd dennis franz (who has hair here!).   the opening scene is still shocking with a fairly long shower scene of angie dickinson that is quite explicit, even 25 years after its release. the film has several erotic scenes in it as dickinson (if that is really her on the closeups) and nancy allen are not shy about showing their bodies.  there is not much dialog in the first 20 minutes and no bad language until franz enters the picture after the murder. the first 36 minutes are riveting and even though it's apparent who the killer is, it's still very good suspense and fun to watch all the way through, particularly for males ogling the naked women.",1
"this would have been so much fun to see in a theater, back in 1996. there is a guilty pleasure corner of my movie taste which really appreciates really well done shocker movies.  ""the dentist"" is panned sometimes probably because people usually have strong feelings over dental matters. maybe the ada launched a campaign against it, since dentists report they have to apologize for this movie and for ""the marathon man"" (which only has one scene comparable to the many in ""the dentist"").  it's amazing to note that according to the trivia page, the movie was shot in 21 days. of course, post production can take longer than movie shooting sometimes and the editing for ""the dentist"" is picture perfect. the quick cuts heighten the tension so much that in the scene where the dentist ""takes care"" of his wife there's only two quick cuts showing what is happening. the rest is left to our very fertile imaginations! corbin bernsen was a good choice for the role since he has lots of experience playing psychologically ""off"" characters and he completely sold the obsessive compulsive aspects of the dentist.  for me the pacing of the movie was just right. the film makers reveal the wife's naughtiness in just the right way. all of the characters in the dental office look like they are actual people working in a real office. there's lots of tension while they are dealing with impatient people awaiting the dentist's arrival. meanwhile the dentist is off on the cusp of a huge psychotic breakdown! unlike so many movies of this genre, the script is very very tight. all the victims fall into the dentist's trap in very calculated ways. two law enforcement types even get involved in a little subplot that ends up creating a shocker of a showdown near the end.  definitely not for the faint of heart or the dental-phobic but a real roller coaster ride and heavily recommended for fans of intelligent gorefests.",1
"i sat through this movie expecting a thought-provoking, fact-based film. but instead was given some of the least thought out arguments against the christian faith imaginable. for instance, in an effort to prove that christianity is inherently violent, the narrator constantly quotes the bible without giving context, and thus altering the meaning of the text. jesus is quoted as commanding the execution of those who disobey him, when in fact, the quote is from a parable jesus told, involving a king who is then quoted. thus the narrator makes it appear as if jesus says one thing when he is actually telling a story where one of his characters says it. this is dishonesty in a very obvious form. is this really what atheism has to offer the world? this film also attempts to use the success of the passion of the christ over jesus christ: superstar and the last temptation of the christ as evidence that christians are bloodthirsty. he makes no mention of the fact that the passion was the most historically accurate bible-film to date. he makes no mention of the fact that it was actually the best liked by critics of the bunch. he then edits in a series of violent images from the passion as if to hammer home his point. ironically, he makes no mention of the texas chainsaw massacre which came out a few months later and plays violence for entertainment, versus dramatic effect.  one thing that really bothered me was his mockery of people who actually knew more about the subject matter than he did. all the christians he interviewed were average schmoes in the parking lot of billy graham's new york crusade. atheists he interviewed for the film were notable authors and scholars. he asked the christians how the christian movement started, and of course, they said it started with the holy spirit coming to the disciples at pentecost. which is correct (acts 2). he then gives the commentary, ""isn't it funny how so few christians seem to know the origins of their own faith?"" and proceeds to explain that the apostle paul started christianity after being stopped on the road to damascus. the poor chap seems convinced that acts 9 happens before acts 2. more deception? or is this simply ignorance? he also throws around nonsense that paul didn't believe jesus was a real person. are you kidding me? 1 corinthians 15 describes jesus death and resurrection being witnessed by people (whom paul names in the passage) for the corinthians to question if they are in doubt!  there are many many other examples of how full of crap this 'documentary' is. but because i don't have time or patience to go into them all, i'll skip straight to the end. it's obvious throughout the whole movie that the narrator has an emotional vendetta against his upbringing in the church. and the climax interview is his childhood principle! in a last-ditch attempt to disprove the christian faith, the narrator tries to make a fool out of someone who gave him a detention as a child. is this what passes as an intellectual documentary for the atheist community? surely there are intelligent atheist filmmakers out there who can make a documentary that isn't a load of made-up crap passed off as 'facts'.",0
"""the bubble"" is an effort to make a gay romeo & juliet type of story with an israeli and a palestinian, although it seems to come at it by way of ""friends"" or ""beverly hills 90210."" the characters are shallow and trite as are the dialog and plot line. the movie seems torn between fluff and depth. on the one hand there is a pointed effort at being shallow as (in one example of many) some minor characters even ask questions that invite development of insight into the conflicts at hand, and get answers like, ""hey, we're here to make a poster for a rave against the occupation. don't get political!"" beyond the obvious absurdity of such a line, it's just one of many ham-fisted signals that the movie is just as hollow and insubstantial as its title suggests. on the other hand, the movie's main pretension to depth follows the lovers to a presentation of ""bent"" a play about gays in a nazi labor camp. the scene on stage is awkwardly rushed, undermining its erotic power (understandable given the constraints of film-time, but still this could have been edited to much better effect.) and comes off as flimsily as the rest of the film. too bad. this play deserves much better.  the characters are so one-dimensionally cartoony some even have names that telegraph their entire (though the word seems inappropriate here) substance. the aggressive soldier from the crack golani brigade is named ""golan."" the militant palestinian is named ""jihad."" the striving-for-chic faghag roommate is ""lulu."" anyone familiar with the checkpoints and life in palestine, whether from real life or documentaries will find the checkpoint scenes as absurdly unreal as well, the rest of this fluffy fantasy. when a palestinian woman goes into the fastest labor on record israeli soldiers are solicitous and helpful, an ambulance shows up in minutes. (the outcome of the birth serves to show the palestinians as unappreciative of israeli beneficence and even downright paranoiac.) altogether the checkpoint is shown as a mere nuisance, not the series of bone-numbing, soul-crushing, humiliating obstructions with no regard for medical care or necessity in cases of birth, death, or severe illness. ashraf, the palestinian lover, seems to get through from nablus to tel aviv with no problems, no papers, no hassles. he just shows up whenever he likes. when the israelis want to get through it is much more of a challenge involving a scheme worthy of lucy ricardo.  against the backdrop of nice, supportive israelis and surly homophobic palestinians we move to a resolution that is utterly lacking in motivation or purpose  except as a painfully obvious dramatic device to milk sympathy for the forbidden lovers.  gay israeli-palestinian romance has been handled on stage with much more skill and depth as in saleem's ""salaam/shalom"" so this film is hardly even as groundbreaking as some people would like to think.  gloriously bad films  like the works of ed wood -- at least have some striking idiosyncrasy to distinguish them. this one doesn't even have that going for it. most of the sound track sounds like simon and garfunkel on quaaludes, and even with the weird oedipal touches to the gay sex scenes, the general incompetence that pervades this movie plays out like a mediocre tv-movie-of-the-week.",0
"flavia the heretic is an undeniable work of art and probably my number one recommendation to state that the euro-exploitation cinema is severely underrated and not to be ignored. this is an intelligent and complex film, beautifully realized and  surprise  pretty damn accurate! this is more than just meaningless sleaze or gratuitous violence and it's about time those prudish film committees who categorize flavia as forbidden trash reckon this as well. flavia is a beautiful 14th century adolescent, forced to live the life of an obedient nun in a strict convent. she refuses to accept her being inferior just because she's female and she curses her fellow sister for being so tolerant about this. after a fruitless attempt to escape, she befriends another rebellious nun and she even guides a troop of bloodthirsty muslims into the walls of the convent.  flavia is a downright mesmerizing film! almost impossible to believe that director gianfranco mingozzi managed to make it appear so realistic and so disturbing. i challenge you to come up with a title that centers on the topic of pioneer-feminism more intensely than flavia does. several sequences are quite shocking (on the verge of nightmarish, actually) as the camera zooms in on brutal rapes, torture and mutilation. yet all this raw footage isn't just used to satisfy perverted gorehounds, mind you. i'm strongly convinced that they're part of the statement 'flavia' is trying to communicate: humanity (the catholic church in particular) historically proved itself to be a hypocrite and discriminating race and there's no use in denying it any further. films like ""flavia, the heretic"" have the courage to question and openly condemn our precious ancestors and i truly admire them for it. flavia is an outstanding and fundamental exploitation film because of its substance, but it's even brought to an higher level by the wondrous cinematography, the glorious costumes & scenery and a breathtaking musical score by nicola piovani. florinda bolkin is very convincing as the ambitious and headstrong nun but it's maría casares who steals the show as sister agatha. she's a man-hating and loud-mouthed nun who likes to urinate in the open field! amen, sister!",1
"watched on hulu (far too many commercials!) so it broke the pacing but even still, it was like watching a really bad buddy movie from the early sixties. dean martin and jerry lewis where both parts are played by jerry lewis. if i were indian, i'd protest the portrayal of all males as venal and all women as shrews. they cheated for the music videos for western sales and used a lot of western models so the males could touch them i usually enjoy indian films a lot but this was a major disappointment, especially for a modern indian film. the story doesn't take place in india (the uncle keeps referring to when mac will return to india) but i can't find out where it is supposed to be happening.",0
"in his brief 40 years on earth, author jack london managed to cram as much adventure and incident as would seem possible. this 90-minute film, purportedly a biography of the man's life but patently fictionalized, doesn't even scratch the surface, and remains a story very ripe for a modern-day retelling. here, michael o'shea, in one of his first roles, portrays london, and his performance is both rugged and sympathetic. he is not the problem here. nor is a young and very beautiful susan hayward, playing his future wife, charmian, whose biography on london is the ""basis"" for this film. london's life has here been broken down into a series of episodes, which the film skips lightly through. so we have brief incidents with london as an oyster pirate, a sealer in the bering sea, a gold prospector in the yukon and a correspondent during the russo-japanese war...colorful events, for sure, but hardly given anything like in-depth treatment. and alfred santell's direction (he also directed one of susan's first films, ""our leading citizen,"" in 1939) is lackadaisical at best. making things rougher here is a very poor-quality dvd, with a crummy-looking print source and hissy sound. perhaps the best thing about this movie rental, for me, was one of the dvd's extras: a catalog of all the alpha video films, featuring hundreds and hundreds of full-color movie posters. let's just hope that these films are in better shape than ""jack london""!",0

"after losing the emmy for her performance as mama rose in the television version of gypsy, bette won an emmy the following year for bette midler: diva las vegas, a live concert special filmed for hbo from las vegas. midler, who has been performing live on stage since the 1970's, proves that she is still one of the most electrifying live performers in the business. from her opening number, her classic ""friends"", where she descends from the wings atop a beautiful prop cloud, bette commands the stage with style and charisma from a rap-styled number called ""i look good"" she then proves that she has a way with a joke like few other performers in this business as she segues her way through a variety of musical selections. the section of the show where she salutes burlesque goes on a little too long but she does manage to incorporate her old sophie tucker jokes here to good advantage (even though she actually forgets one joke in the middle of telling it, but her ad-libbing until she remembers it is hysterical). bette also treats us to ""rose's turn"" from gypsy and the title tune from her smash film the rose as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie the first wives club. she brings the house down near the end with ""stay with me, baby"" from the rose and her only #1 hit record, ""wind beneath my wings"" from beaches. it's a dazzling evening of musical comedy entertainment and for midler fans, it's a must.",1
"i wasted 5.75 to see this crappy movie so i just want to know a few things:  what was the point of the dog being split in half at the beginning of the movie, the disease had nothing to do with being split in half.  what was the point of dragging karen into the shed, she already totally infected her room, they could have just locked her in there where she would have been safer.  why would the hermit be running around the forest asking strangers to help him when he could have just asked his relative, the hog lady, to take him to the hospital?  why didn't any of the characters bother to walk into town to get help when things started getting bad, are they all really that lazy?  even if paul was threatened by the guy w/ the shotgun for peeping on his wife, paul could have just sent jeff or bert back to the house to ask for help. the girl he loves is deteriorating.  what was the point of the box?  why did jeff go back to the cabin after he left when everyone else was getting infected, if he was that big of a jerk to leave in the first place wouldn't he have just gone back home?  if the police went to all the trouble of gathering up the kids and burning them on the fire pit, why did they throw paul halfway into the river, it wasn't even necessary for the plot because the water was already contaminated.  who makes lemonade out of river water, that crap has dirt leaves and bugs in it. why couldn't the two kids have just use the tap water, it was contaminated too, so the stupid ending would still work.",0
"after watching two of his silent shorts, 'elena and her men (1956)' is my first feature-length film from french director jean renoir, and i quite enjoyed it. however, i didn't watch the film for renoir, but for star ingrid bergman, who  at age 41  still radiated unsurpassed beauty, elegance and charm. throughout the early 1950s, following her scandalous marriage to italian roberto rossellini, bergman temporarily fell out of public favour. her next five films, directed by her husband, were unsuccessful in the united states, and i suspect that renoir's latest release did little to enhance bergman's popularity with english-speaking audiences {however, she did regain her former success with an oscar in the same year's 'anastasia (1956)'}. she stars as elena sokorowska, a polish princess who sees herself as a guardian angel of sorts, bringing success and recognition to promising men everywhere, before promptly abandoning them. while working her lucky charms to aid the political aspirations of the distinguished general francois rollan (jean marais), she finds herself falling into a love that she won't be able to walk away from. this vaguely-political film works well as either a satire or a romantic comedy, as long as you don't take it too seriously; it's purely lighthearted romantic fluff.  filmed in vibrant technicolor, 'elena and her men' looks terrific as well, a flurry of bright colours, characters and costumes. bergman's polish princess is dreamy and somewhat self-absorbed, not in an unlikable way, but hardly a woman of high principles and convictions. she is persuaded by a team of bumbling government conspirators to convince general rollan to stage a coup d'état, knowingly exploiting his love for her in order to satisfy her own delusions as a ""guardian angel."" perhaps the film's only legitimately virtuous character is henri de chevincourt (mel ferrer, then audrey hepburn's husband), who ignores everybody else's selfish secondary motives and pursues elena for love, and love alone. this, renoir proudly suggests, is what the true french do best. 'elena and her men' also attempts, with moderate success, to expose the superficiality of upper-class french liaisons, through the clumsy philandering of eugène (jacques jouanneau), who can't make love to his servant mistress without his fiancè walking in on them. for these sequences, renoir was obviously trying for the madcap sort of humour that you might find in a marx brothers film, but the film itself is so relaxed and laid-back that the energy just isn't there.",1
"put quite simply, this film is terrifying.  it starts off simply, looking like a study of a rebellious young girl and goes on to become a beautifully crafted horror film.  don't expect gore, or zombies. this is psychological, and just as he would also do in candyman, bernard rose manages to convey the horror that is not being believed.  each time you watch this film, you realise more about what's happening, and about how the two worlds in this film interconnect.  drawings have never been scarier.",1

"i will begin by saying i am very pleased with this climax of the bourne trilogy. please, oh please don't ruin it by doing a sequel years from now or a prequel. just leave it alone. right..moving on.as talented and versatile as matt damon is...it seems as though he was just meant to play jason bourne.  if you are a fan of the first two bourne movies, you will not be disappointed by the third installment. it sticks to what works and adds a little more. i was very pleased to see how well all the information we obtain in 'identity' and 'supremacy' all mesh in 'ultimatum' to finally paint the full picture of jason bourne's troubled past. the action sequences are fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat. the fights between bourne and the assassins are always fun to watch. i have always been a fan of movies surrounding cia agents and how the cia gather their intel and this movie is right up that street, making it even more exciting for me.  if you choose to watch the bourne ultimatum without watching the previous 2 installments..you will still thoroughly enjoy the movie but i would still recommend you watch them first. this would allow you to fully understand the character jason bourne and become attached and be a part of his world. this allows you to appreciate and enjoy the movie even more. i'm not sure which is the better of the first 2 but i personally think 'ultimatum' might, just might, have the edge when comparing the trilogy.",1

"some of my favorite laurel and hardy films have very, very little plot. instead, they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious! films such as help mates and busy bodies are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house. here in dirty work, most of the film is akin to these other two films--stan and ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying (quite unsuccessfully) to clean a crazy professor's chimney. seeing ollie fall through the chimney, the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of stanley all work together to make a very pleasing film.  however, in an odd twist, there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie. it seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger. late in the film, you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg! given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room, is it any surprise what happens next? while this subplot was unnecessary, it worked well enough. what worked exceptionally well was the middle portion. give the boys nothing exciting to do and you'll be amazed at the hilarious results. one of the team's better films and it almost earns a 9.",1
"fantastic mr. fox is a comedy based on the classic roald dahl book. wes anderson directs, and respectably takes the short book of the same name to the big screen in a full length film. while i respect what anderson, an incredibly talented man did, the film seemed to have gotten lost in its own clever spirit. anderson seems to have left the story behind knowing that he is a talented man, and if this happened to be a bad film, it would be his first bad film. just like when you go to school and have your first bad day, this is anderson's first bad day in film making, so i am going to let him off easy. i will admit it did have a cleverness and nice spirit to it, and the animation is nice, but the film gets progressively harder to get into, leaving the story behind and having random shots of random things happening. the characters are good, also. jason schwartzman voices mr. fox (george clooney)'s smart ass son, ash, and especially engaging. the film does not quite make it up to a level of terribleness, but it certainly gets closer and closer as it goes along. i'm sure wes anderson will get back on track with another amazing film when and where he decides to make another film, but for now, i'm sorry, wes anderson, this film of yours was a big disappointment.",0
"the girl from missouri arrives in new york city knowing exactly what she wants: to amount to something solid by marrying a millionaire - without losing her virginity. with her knockout good looks she quickly catches the eye of the playboy son of a tycoon, but by staying true to her virtue will she also discover true love?  jean harlow sizzles in this excellent little comedy. with her platinum hair & gorgeous accouterments, she is a dazzler. but her beauty should not obscure the fact that she was also a very good actress. she has rightfully earned her spot at the very top of the hollywood pantheon.  an excellent cast gives harlow fine support: lionel barrymore as the wily old tycoon, wise to harlow's ways; handsome franchot tone as his son, smitten with love; raucous patsy kelly, stealing her scenes as harlow's sidekick; debonair alan mowbray, as a well-mannered english lord; elderly clara blandick as barrymore's feisty secretary; hearty hale hamilton as a rich man with an eye for the ladies; muscular nat pendleton as a lifeguard who catches kelly's flirtatious eye; and lewis stone, unforgettable in a small role as a bankrupted businessman.  it should be noted that this film was produced soon after hollywood's production code was instituted. a comparison with red-headed woman, made two years earlier, would be fascinating - in which harlow's character goes after the same ends, but uses very different means.",1
"let's see where to begin... bad acting; i'm not sure if i'd even call it that, as it more along the lines of a no-effort script read. the actors didn't even seem to be into their parts and seemed quite lifeless and listless. sure there was a scene or two with nudity, but that couldn't save this movie from it's lifeless characters.  to call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. the lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants.  budget? did this movie even have a budget? it seemed like they used less money than i've seen in a home-shot youtube video. bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that. story could have been good if the people actually seemed interested in making it so, but there was no life to this flick; i don't care who directed it.  i've seen some really bad flicks in the past year and this one is definitely at the very bottom. don't waste your time or you'll be wishing you listened to this unbiased review. check the ratings, you'll see the 1's are rapidly outpacing the fluffed 10's with hardly anything in between. wish i would have looked a little closer before wasting my time. what a suck-fest!",0
"the only reason i watched the movie till the end was the ""hope"" to see something interesting. the movie is really bad and the performance of the girl it is really, really bad, honestly, i am not a movie critic neither an expert but you just need common sense to notice that this work it is incredibly bad.  the first thing that came to my mind as soon as she started to talk was: ""she has an affair with willem dafoe and he accepted to help her with the screenplay and appear in her movie since she is the brilliant director""... surprise, surprise, next day after i watched the film i found out on internet that giada colagrande is his wife. awful story and terrible performance.",0
"i made the big mistake of actually watching this whole movie a few nights ago. god i'm still trying to recover. this movie does not even deserve a 1.4 average. imdb needs to have 0 vote ratings possible for movies that really deserve it like this one. a 1.4 is too high.  i had heard how awful this movie was, but i really did not think a movie could actually be that bad, especially in this day and era. i figured all of the cheesy god awful movies were only from the 1950s and 1960s. my god was i wrong. trust me folks, this movie really is that bad. it is beyond horrible; it is beyond pathetic; it is beyond any type of word that i can think of for it. battlefield earth looks like best picture of the year compared to this movie. snake island (which up until now was the worst movie i'd ever seen) looks like it deserves a few oscars compared to this pathetic effort.  i seriously can not believe that the makers of this movie thought this was a legitimate serious effort of producing a hollywood movie. this has no business being called a movie. in the first 25 seconds of the film, i seriously thought i was watching some high school theater class attempting to make a short movie. or better yet, i thought it was some saturday night live ripoff skit of the real thing. i mean, it looks exactly like that. the acting is horrible; the whole movie almost looks like it was shot with a 20 year old vhs video camera. the special effects.......well good lord bewitched from back in the day had better special effects than this movie. the scene where he gets shot at the door is beyond laughable and beyond cheesy. i mean seriously, my intro to acting class from 4 years ago in college, all of us could have put together a better movie than this. and the worst part of the entire movie, where arthur is naked in the bathroom. oh my god i almost thew up right there. i have a strong stomach, but wow that was horrible. some people should never be naked, and he's one of them. the plot of this movie just seems to go absolutely nowhere. they talk about legal issues that we never hear about again; ben talks about getting into music that we never hear about again; arthur says he is looking for a job and money for college and the next thing we see is he's running a porn shop. everything about the movie is just horrible.  this really doesn't have much to do with my critique, but just so everyone knows, i am not a gay man. i do however support gay rights and believe we should all be treated as equals. and i would support any gay person in my church, unlike the cruel priest in this movie, who by the way seems to cuss every other word. (where is the f*(#*ing white out?) hahaha but i didn't want anyone to think i hated this movie just because of it being about two gay guys. it has nothing to do with that: this would have been just as horrible of a movie if it was ben & jill instead of ben & arthur.  i just watched this movie to see if it really was as bad as they say. and yes it was even worse than i had read. let this be a warning to everyone: only watch this movie if you want to just sit back and laugh at how pathetic some movies in the 21st century can still be. if you watch this movie and are actually expecting a good movie or some entertainment, i have no sympathy for you whatsoever.  on a final thought: how in the world are there 7 movies ranked below this on imdb? there is no way there are 7 movies out there that are worse than this!",0
"scotty (grant cramer, who would go on to star in the great b-movie ""killer klowns from outer space"") agrees to help three middle-aged guys learn how to 'dialog' the ladies in this bad '80's comedy. not bad as in '80's lingo, which meant good. bad as in bad. with no likable characters, including, but not limited to, a kid who's the freakiest looking guy since ""friday the 13th part 2""' a girl who leads men on and then goes into hissy fits when they want to touch her, and the token fat slob, because after all what would an '80's sex comedy be without a fat slob?? well this one has two. this movie is pretty much the bottom of the barrel of '80's sex comedies. and then came the sequel thus deepening said proverbial barrel.  my grade:d-   eye candy: too numerous to count, you even see the freaky looking kid imagined with boobs at on point, think ""bachlor party"" but not as funny, and very disturbing.  where i saw it: comcast moviepass",0
"the film had some likable aspects. perhaps too many for my taste. it felt as though the writer/director was desperately trying to get us to feel the inner conflict of all of its characters. not once, a few times...but all of the time.   this is the job of television, not cinema.   the location of the train station was well chosen and i enjoyed sascha horler's performance as the pregnant friend.   i felt as though justine clarke's performance was wan. her reactions to things felt forced, as though the director were trying to vocalise the themes of the film through her protagonist's expressions. i also can't believe that a director can make the wonderful daniela farinacci into an unbelievable presence.   i cannot understand the choice of pop music slapped over entire sequences. this is a lazy device, especially where the pop music comes from no place diagetic to the film and/or where the lyrics of the song feel embarrassingly earnest.   that said, there is a breezy quality about the film that evokes the australian heat and local attitude with originality. it does create an atmosphere of heat and sunshine. especially with the usage of wonderful animation sequences that rescue the film from complete mediocrity, infusing it with passion and hand-crafted charm.   i am curious why the dialogue feels so overworked. ""who knows if there's a god? like some guy sitting there up in the sky telling us what to do"" or whatever the line was.   perhaps one of the more embarrassing moments was the friend returning home from cricket with a bunch of flowers to declare to his wife ""i'm giving up smoking.""   an anti-smoking commercial? a tac ad with some tasteful animation? i had to leave the cinema at the 50 minute mark -- it was all too much.",0
"i'm watching the series again now that it's out on dvd (yay!) it's striking me as fresh, as relevant and as intriguing as when it first aired.  the central performances are gripping, the scripts are layered.  i'll stick my neck out and put it up there with the prisoner as a show that'll be winning new fans and still be watched come 2035.  i've been asked to write some more line (it seems imdb is as user unfriendly and anally retentively coded as ever! pithy and to the point is clearly not the imdb way.)  well, unlike imdb's submissions editors, american gothic understands that simplicity is everything.  in 22 episodes, the show covers more character development than many shows do in seven seasons. on top of which it questions personal ethics and strength of character in a way which challenges the viewer at every turn to ask themselves what they would choose and what they would think in a given situation.  when the show first aired, i was still grieving for twin peaks and thought it would be a cheap knock off. personally i'm starting to rate it more highly and suspect it will stand up better over the years. reckon it don't get more controversial than that!",1
"the documentary presents an original theory about ""guns, germs and steel"". the series graphically portray several episodes strongly supporting the theory, and defend the theory against common criticism.  i was deeply puzzled to find user comments complaining about lack of new information in these series. they say documentary presents information which is taught in middle school. indeed, it does. in fact, i greatly enjoyed the original look at the information which i have known since middle school and the unexpected analysis.  so, if you like knowing why things work, if you have taken apart the telephone trying to determine how it worked, if you have gone to the farm to see how farm works and how cows are milked, you will enjoy this series. a definite recommendation.",1

"because that is the only way you won't think this film is a total waste of time and money. a remake of ""heaven can wait"", (which was at least worth watching) is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy. it is more a vehicle to give rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesn't play well on the big screen. especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old, fat, rich, dead man but are shown coming from rock himself. as he insults blacks and whites the chemistry is all wrong. the movie is not funny, poorly shot the acting is weak at best. go rent ""heaven can wait"" and a live rock video and you'll be way ahead of the game.",0

"tarzan the ape man is a remake of the 1932 film of the same time, and like that earlier film, it has little resemblance to burroughs' literary character. but while the 1932 tarzan was reduced to ""tarzan - jane"" speech, this tarzan, played by miles o'keeffe, doesn't speak or even grunt. he does do the the tarzan yell a couple of times, which sounds like it was sampled from the earlier film.  no, tarzan plays second banana to bo derek as jane. or rather, as third banana to bo derek's left breast and her right breast. this movie has no point but to show derek naked.  the two action scenes in the film are presented in slow motion, and are really bad. more evidence that no one cared.  bizarrely enough, tarzan has an orangutan side kick in this film. maybe he car pooled in from sumatra with the indian elephants that are also on display.",0
"i love seth green. his appearances on that 70s' show is always worth watching but last night, i felt the show needed to overhauled. four single young guys inherit a new york city apartment that most of us would die for. the grandmother must have been an heiress to have such space in the first place. so i felt the need for realism should have been brought out. anyway the plot about four best friends getting this apartment was not believable. i would have been thrilled if they had to move in with one of their parents which would have provided great humor and dysfunctional about the show's set up. there did not seem to be much humor in it. i am only watching it because it falls before my name is earl on a winning thursday night. i think they should go back, scrap this series, and start over. we need more family involved series. how about seth and his friends move in with his wacky parents in the suburbs after a fire burns their place down. they could have dabney coleman play the father and christine estabrook, play the mother and dysfunctional siblings. the list of possibilities with somebody like seth green are endless and the network is blowing it.",0
"i think dolph lundgren had potential at being a big action star a la schwarzenegger, stallone, and even van damme to certain degree. he had some big moments in his career but he also made some poor choices and this is definitely one of them although made later in his career. the strange thing about jill the ripper (or jill rips...or tied up) is that i honestly think they seriously thought they were making a provocative and serious thriller? it shows in the way that they describe it on imdb, on the dvd case, in the commentaries, and this film is not serious. to call it campy would be a huge understatement. the film tries to be complex and intelligent when in fact it's nothing more than shallow, confusing and gratuitous. on top of that they put lundgren, who is known for action films, in an attempt at a serious role which makes it even more campy because his range as an actor is pretty limited. the entire film revolves around the kinky sex world and yet they attempt at making it a serious thriller? just the plot and premise immediately make it a b-movie porn at very best.  dolph lundgren plays disgraced former cop and raging alcoholic matt sorenson who decides to play detective when his brother is murdered. i mean put aside the numerous plot holes that has lundgren getting free roam to investigate crime scenes, and witnesses and everything else even though he's not a cop anymore and you still have a pretty strange and rather lack luster performance from lundgren. danielle brett is lundgren's eventual love interest and his brother's widow. brett plays her role decently enough considering the script and campy story. the supporting cast is huge and no one particularly stands out in their performances unless it's on the negative side such as the absolutely horrible performance by victor pedtrchenko who seems to go by several different names in the film, boasts an awful accent and is a really awful villain.  i honestly tried to get into the mystery and film and watch closely but there wasn't any reason to because it was all a jumble of ridiculous plot and gratuitous sex games including a downright ridiculously hilarious scene where lundgren goes under cover and is strung upside down nearly naked. to explain how classy and well done this movie is (sarcasm...sarcasm) the back of the dvd i picked up (it was really cheap) has lundgren's character listed as ""murray wilson"" (not the name of his character in the film.) while somehow lundgren manages to be usually watchable the film falls flat on it's face trying to be serious. considering director anthony hickox is infamous for really b-movie horror flicks it only makes sense even though i think he was really trying to be serious. hard core cult lundgren fans will have to see it...no one else should...certainly for any sort of mystery or suspense. 3/10",0
"but this movie was a bore. the history part was fine but the musical part was not. not one song i cared about and no soundtrack to be heard.  if sweet jesus"" was suppose to be comic relief it never work. if john adams was suppose to be the obnoxious annoying one, the rest of them were trying to overthrow him in every scene.  hancock and jefferson were the only bearable characters in the whole movie.  the historical quotes and the debate about slavery in their historical context were interesting enough but not enough to overcome the lack of music in a musical.  shouldn't you be humming the songs after a musical, except for a few chirps, nothing else was worth the breath.",0

"spacecamp is my favorite movie. it is a great story and also inspires others.  the acting was excellent and my wife and i went to see lea thompson in cabaret years later due to her performance in the movie. it is unfortunate that the challenger accident delayed and hurt the movie.  the 20th anniversary of the challenger accident is coming up. i knew one of the challenger astronauts off and on since childhood on the carnegie mellon campus where my father went to school; i also know a close friend of the late pilot.  i was the technical review last year for national bsa for the boy scout astronomy merit badge and i still find spacecamp a great movie to recommend to scouts doing the space related merit badges i teach.  i ran into the late astronaut again as an adult and was following a schedule of engineering education we had put together when challenger blew up. i wound up sitting in with willard rockwell and his engineers,""invisible"", going over things after the accident at the astrotech stockholders meeting by chance as a result, so i'm much closer to the accident and any movie similarities. i made sure that i was a good student and finished the degree four years later, strangely enough, on the recommendation of the rockwell engineer who told them not to fly challenger in 1986 and who later built endeavour.",1
"a clever script from the late sebastian japrisot and smart performances from the two male leads - alain delon and charles bronson (or should it be the other way around) result in an engaging and entertaining thriller.  add to the above the competent direction from veteran jean herman and a sparse but effective score by francois de roubaix, it becomes easy why this film has an odd timeless quality.  this is a buddy buddy or bonding story with two loners, both disillusioned and world weary, returning, presumably from algiers. like the other colonial powers of this time (post ww ii leading into the 60s), france had struggled to keep up appearances overseas. losing algiers was a bitter blow.  adieu l'ami (the original title) chronicles the actions of our two (anti) heroes as they struggle to make a go of it, after their discharge.  one thing happens after another, and the viewer really has to pay attention, because japrisot is lean and economical with his script: if it is there, then there must be a reason.  suffice to say, these two men battle it out, physically and psychologically, one long weekend. their motivation is quite different, their goals are different - their survival depends entirely on each other. that alain delon and charles bronson are outwardly so different - the former, arguably a pretty boy, and the latter an ugly thug, adds to the chemistry.  that quest makes for a great story, which in turn, makes for a great film.  lest i forget there are women in this film, and true to the japrisot method, they too are memorable, though not nearly as fleshed out; to say much more would be to spoil one's delight in discovering their true nature.  farewell, friend has been released in the uk; an anamorphic image, 16.9 enhanced; in english only (not even subtitles for the hard of hearing); a running time of 110 minutes; mono soundtrack but the de roubaix music has lots of punch!   highly recommended.",1
"the movie has a distinct (albeit brutish and rough) humanity for all its borderline depravity - the zippy/lyrical score points up the comic side of their misadventures, and even when they're at their most thuggish (like terrorizing the woman on the train), a semi-pitiful vulnerability lurks never far away (dewaere sucks on her breasts like a baby). blier cuts away from the scene where depardieu may be about to rape dewaere, so we're never sure how explicitly to read the manifestly homoerotic aspect of their relationship - either way, that incident is the start of their relative humanization (so the movie could certainly be read as pro-gay, although it could likely be read as pro-anything you want). the movie has many objectionable scenes and points of sexual politics and is probably best taken as a general cartoon on the foibles of both sexes, making a mockery of the whole notion of sensitivity and honesty, and hitting numerous points of possible profundity on the basis that if you fire off enough shots, some of them are bound to hit.",1
"not the greatest film to remember paul naschy by.  gaston (guillermo bredeston) is probably the worst swordsman i have ever seen. zorro would be ashamed! his only salvation came as the competition was just as bad.  this film is described as adventure and horror. forget the horror - there is none. no nudity, no blood, no monsters; just a robin hood adventure against an evil baron (paul naschy) who wants to be king.  the main feature of the film was seeing graciela nilson, who only made four films in two years and disappeared to our regrettable loss. where did she go?",0
"in this swimming pool, this pond, there are water lilies and there are frogs. frogs sit on water lilies. the frog and water lily have a parasitic relationship. marie(pauline acquart) is a water lily, a synchronized swimming groupie with a crush on floraine(adele haenel), a frog, the captain of her team. floraine's teammates shun their leader because the preternaturally curvy and well-proportioned blonde conveys a loose persona that betrays the syncrhronized swimmer's mindset of conformity and discipline. but floraine has a secret; the bombshell has a bombshell, which ""naissance des pieuvres"" reveals to the audience, visually, before she confides in marie.  floraine has never gone, as they say, all the way, with a boy.  at a party, we see a double-image of the burgeoning sex bomb checking her make-up in a bathroom mirror. ""lolita"" is a fata morgana. marie gets to know floraine's double while her imitation breaks the water lily's heart. while the frog goes through the motions of catching flies for appearance's sake, she gets chummy with the water lily when no one's looking. in the film's most startling scene, the water lily agrees to give the frog a hand in losing her virginity through the mechanical act of oral stimulation. floraine wants boys to like her, but she doesn't like boys, seemingly, but it's more important to the frog that she's popular. when the water lily finally kisses the frog, the frog remains a frog. the frog can't transform into a water lily, or a princess, because the water lily lost the frog's respect. after their lips unlock, floraine tells marie, ""see, it's easy,"" which is the frog's way of equating their kiss with the orgasm that her friend gave her as nothing more than a rite-of-passage without any strings attached. floraine's beauty is a burden. she carries the weight of meeting boy's expectations. florence uses marie to have one final fling before her fata morgana subjugates its imitation into the closet.  the other water lily, the other frog, marie's best friend anne(louise blachere) and floraine's frustrated boy-toy francois(warren jacobs), just like any water lily and frog, have a parasitic relationship, too. while floraine uses marie for love, francois uses anne for sex. but that's life; that's the treachery of growing up, in which even a friend will turn on a good friend if the opportunity to move up the food chain presents itself. at a mcdonalds, the water lily chastises the other water lily after bathing extensively in the frog's afterglow. physical beauty is a currency. marie gets to call the shots because anne, although far from being ugly, is overweight and has an unflattering hairdo. anne tries to fight back by using her breasts as ample retaliation(the magnifying glass from her happy meal incidentally comments on marie's flat chest), but the tadpole(marie thinks she's better than anne, better than a water lily) points out that her breasts are a byproduct of fat.   teenaged girls can be brutal to each other.  later, in the final shot, ""naissance des pieuvres"" suggests that marie has a double, too, and this symbiosis among water lilies has the potential to turn parasitic in the near-future, if it not already has. teenaged girls can be brutal to each other in a way that no boy could match.",1
"oh, this is such a glorious musical. there's a bit of miscasting -- frank sinatra is sorely miscast as the jewish nathan detroit, though it only becomes evident on ""sue me"", which is a distinctly jewish song. sadly, the filmmakers decided to cut out one of the best songs from the show, ""marry the man today"", and replaced it with an inferior sinatra showpiece. with these two flaws in mind, the movie is otherwise magnificent. jean simmons shines as sarah brown. marlon brando can't sing worth beans, but pulls it off anyway. stubby kaye wonderfully reprises his broadway role (it was written for him). damon runyon's language and pacing and humor come through quite well. this is on my see-it-every-chance-i-get list.",1

"as a kid, i loved this game. i played it a zillion times during spring 1993 with my friend andrew. i used to play axel or blaze and he would be adam and no matter how often we played it we never seemed to get bored. then streets of rage 2 came out. and we quickly forgot that this one even existed.  you play as ex-cops axel stone, adam or blaze fielding, who have quit the force in order to take on the bad guys in their own way. there are 8 levels to work thru in a run-down and corrupt city led by the evil mr x. beating up all the bad guys and the end-of-level boss is much fun. level 4 (the bridge) was my fave because you could chuck baddies down the holes into the river. you even have the chance to become mr. x's right hand man at the end of the game (at a price). this leads to the 'bad ending' in which you become the the boss of the syndicate. exactly how this is possible is a mystery since you destroy the syndicate on your way to mr. x, but never mind.  streets of rage also has truly fantastic music. the composer yuzo koshiro did absolute miracles with the limited technology of the sega genesis. the main theme, level one, level 4 and final boss are standout tunes.   as a wii owner i am proud to have this forever on my console. but with streets of rage 2 also available, it does kind of render the first one somewhat obsolete.  pros:  average graphics but nice backgrounds represented in a comic-book like panel progression that fits the tone of the game.  great tunes.  easy to get into and hard to put down.  cons:  vastly inferior to the infinitely more complex streets of rage 2.  poor enemy ai. baddies often walk away from you instead of engaging in combat. this is especially infuriating with the level 5 boss.  lack of combo moves.  lack of decent weapons.  bad guy models are repeated far too often.  graphics b- sound a- gameplay b- lasting appeal b-",1
"a low point in human interaction was reached by the maysles brothers with this film. do remember, you who used words like ""masterpiece""when reviewing this film, that these maysles creeps didn't just happen to drive to the hamptons and happen to shoot film on some eccentric people. no, when they found these two poor pathetic people they then had to finance their project (and imagine what they told the money people to sell the project). then they befriended the two extremely vulnerable women. no meeting of minds here or real consensual participation. these wretched maysles smiled, kissed ass, did whatever they had to to get the beales to cooperate and then exploited them as viciously as has ever been done. one would like to think that these hustlers had occasional thoughts of remorse and guilt. but the film-making process, given the preplanning, actual shooting and then editing took a lot of time and their goal had no provisions for actually relating to the beales as human beings. an exploitation film perpetrated by the vilest of people. as time accrued their film-making reputation has been seriously stained by what they did here. their reputation as human beings is execrable. that is what people will remember them as. grotesque hustlers.",0
"i think this is a great version, i came on here before, to help me find which version i should use and i went to jane eyre 1983 and read a comment from users comment and then helped me to get this version. i do not regret picking this version and neither will you. i tried watching all the other versions and none matched up to it,there is nothing like the book,and trust me if you are reading the book you want something that is going to match up with it. when you are looking for something real and moving after you have read the book it is hard because you want something that is going to match up with that. i would say god personally led me to this version. it points to true love for a humans. i would say god's love is greater.if there is anything better, i would like to see it. but so far there is none like it!",1
"this is a good adaptation of austen's novel. good, but not brilliant.  the cinematography is inventive, crossing at times the border to gimmickry, but it certainly avoids the trap of making this look like a boring tv soap in costumes, given that the entire story is dialogue-driven.  the acting is competent. ms paltrow is aloof, as her character requires, but the required distance from the other characters is accompanied by a much less appropriate detachment from her own actions. in other words, she does not seem to care enough of the results of her match-making endeavours. some of the supporting cast is guilty of over-acting - very much in the style that is appreciated on stage but out of place in motion pictures. personally, i had problems accepting alan cumming as mr elton - to no fault of his own, except for having left such an impression as a gay trolley-dolly in ""the high life"" that it is now difficult to accept him playing any serious part. acting honours go to toni collette who manages to radiate warmth, and jeremy northam who pitches his character at just the right level.",1
"i cannot comment on this film without discussing its significance to me personally. as a child bad health prevented me from ever going to a cinema. i first encountered movies at the end of wwii through roger manvilles splendid penguin book ""film"", which brought me so much pleasure as my health began to improve that i wish i could buy another copy to re-read today. my introduction to many classics films such as the battleship potemkin, drifters (grierson's magnificent documentary), metropolis, the cabinet of dr caligari, and ecstasy; came first through this book and later at my university art-house cinema. ecstasy had incurred the wrath of the vatican, for condoning eva's desertion of emil, her subsequent divorce, and the brief swim she took in the buff, but roger manville ignored these trivial matters and discussed the film as a triumphant, outstandingly beautiful, visual paean to love - a view echoed by many imdb users. a very lonely young man, when i saw it, i willingly concurred. no further opportunity to see ecstasy arose until the introduction of home videos - by then it had become a treasured memory not to be disturbed. quite recently i finally added ecstasy to my home video collection and found this assessment very superficial. ecstasy is much more of a parable on the continuity of human existence, against which individual lives are insignificant - perhaps a tribute to what bernard shaw in his aggressively agnostic writings used to term 'the lifeforce'.   ecstasy portrays a young bride marrying a middle aged man whose sex urge is no longer strong. disappointed, she returns home and divorces him. soon after she experiences a strong mutual attraction to a young virile man she meets whilst out horse riding. she makes love for the first time and it is an overwhelming experience. her former husband cannot face rejection and gives the young man a lift in his car intending that a passing train will kill them both on a level crossing. but the train stops in time and the apparently ill driver is taken to recuperate at a nearby hotel where he later commits suicide by shooting himself. after these exciting climacteric sequences, a bland, predictable and almost inevitable ending emphasises that whilst individual human lives exhibit both joy and tragedy, collectively life continues to carry us all forward in its stream and only through contributing to this stream can we be truly happy. this story is trite, the acting is no more than adequate; and normally such a film would have disappeared into the garbage, as did most of its contemporaries, long ago. what has given ecstasy its classic status is exceptional cinematography, a continuous lyrical score and very careful loving direction, coupled with something fortuitous but in cinematographic terms very important - it appeared just after the introduction of sound and was probably planned as a silent film. it is sub-titled and its director has exploited the impact of brief verbal sequences accompanying some sub-titles, and occasionally breaking into the score which so lovingly carries the film forward. this makes it not only almost unique but extremely rewarding to watch. the parable in the tale is stressed continuously but so subtly that only when reflecting after viewing does one become fully aware of it. for example, the names - eva and adam; the obsessive behavior of emil on his wedding night which shows that triviata have become the most important thing in his life and predicate his eventual suicide since he has no adequate purpose to sustain him; the ongoing series of beautiful sequences showing erotic imagery (a bee pollinating a flower, a key entering a lock, a breaking necklace during eva's virginal lovemaking sequence with adam, etc.); and the final post-suicide sequences which could have been filmed in many different ways but serve to extol the importance to individuals of performing some type of work that contributes positively to society, as well as of creating new life to sustain this society after we ourselves pass on.   as a 1933 film i would rate this at 9 - even comparing it with contemporary works i would not reduce this below 8. for me the film will always remain a ""must see"", (although you may feel that my background remarks above indicate some bias in this judgment). unfortunately in north america contemporary assessments of this film have been distorted by the extreme 1930's reaction to hedy kiesler's very brief and relatively unimportant nude scene which she had difficulty living down in hollywood (some critics, who have clearly not seen such classic films as hypocrites, hula, back to god's country, bird of paradise or some of the early works of d.w. griffiths and c.b. demille, have even erroneously referred to this as the first appearance of a nude actress in a feature film). this scene was probably part of the original novel, and the film would have been very little different if the director had chosen to rewrite it.  two further thoughts; firstly this is a czech film, released there in 1933. its final message about hard work generating positive benefits for society must have seemed very superficial to its viewers when a few years later their country became the first victim of nazi oppression and was virtually destroyed for at least two generations (i do not remember these sequences being screened just after the war when i first saw this film - were they removed from the copy i saw then?). secondly for me its main message today is that things of real beauty are often very transitory even though their memory may stay with one for a lifetime. we should all be thankful that today some of them can be captured on camera and viewed again at our convenience.",1
"this is best comedy i ever seen! but not all can understand this you must be from georgia to understand this amazing movie! :) overall one of best film i ever seen......... vachtangi(benjamin) and all supporting actors playing very very good but acting of kote daoshvili (father germogel) is for my opinion best acting in supporting role in history of films :)) in this movie playing many georgian stars like ipolite xvichia,sergo zakariadze,sofiko chiaureli,verikoan djafaridze,sesilia takaishvili,dodo abashidze.... they all are stars in georgian cinematography :) plus in this movie is playing great russian star evgeni leonov and of course director of the film georgy danelia is one of the best...... i recommending this movie for everyone but remember you must know good russian language to watch this movie",1
"the basic premise of ""miami golem"" most definitely deserves a spot in the top, say, fifty of most demented cinematic plots ever scripted down! i know top 50 doesn't sound too impressive, but i've seen a lot of really weird films with lunatic plots. i was prepared from something convoluted, because the film was directed and co-written by alberto de martino, who was one of italy's most ambitious and creative but sadly underrated film makers. de martino steals multiple ideas from successful blockbusters, like most italian directors did around that time, but he always adds a lot of stuff to make it even more complex, confusing and overwhelming. not all of de martino's films are worthwhile, but some of them are extremely underrated, like ""a special magnum for tony saitta"", ""holocaust 2000"" and ""formula for a murder"". the concept of ""miami golem"" contains elements from numerous great sci-fi and adventure flicks (like ""alien"", ""starman"" , ""close encounters of the third kind"", ""et"", ) but i wouldn't exactly call it a rip-off. the only thing that is really shamelessly stolen from another film is the opening synthesizer theme song that sounds almost identical to harold faltermeyer's axel f. from ""beverly hills cop"". the rest of the film is an amusing hodgepodge of fantasy, sci-fi, action, horror and superhero-movie gimmicks. it certainly doesn't always make sense (most of the time it doesn't, actually) but ""miami golem"" is undeniably an imaginative and multifaceted film that kept my mate and i fascinated from start to finish.  the plot is extremely difficult to briefly summarize but i'll try anyway. sceptical journalist craig milford is reporting the story of a german scientist who allegedly discovered extraterrestrial dna inside a crashed meteorite and managed to clone it. the dna cell belongs to an evil alien force that already exterminated another interstellar race in the past and it will unquestionably destroy the whole of mankind as soon as it grows large enough in size. if this isn't problematic enough already, the rich mr. anderson ordered to steal the slowly growing evil fetus because he thinks that he can manipulate it and use it to obtain world domination. with the help of some good aliens in an earthly disguise, craig milford has the difficult task of safeguarding the planet from the evil fetus. okay, i know all this sounds grotesque and silly, but i assure that ""miami golem"" is in fact a light-headed and easy digestible flick. the first half of the film may come across as overly hectic and confusing, because alberto de martino attempts to keep the plot secret through the use of preposterous red herrings. there are subliminal ghostly appearances, supportive characters behaving exaggeratedly mysterious for no real reason and at a certain point there are even speculations about the lost continent of atlantis. this is all misleading padding material, however, and as soon as the set-up is more or less clear ""miami golem"" turns into an ordinary early 80's popcorn action movie with bloody massacres, flamboyant chase sequences (in the florida everglades!), explosions, gratuitous sleaze and nasty little fetus-monsters in jars.  now, i really don't want to raise the impression that ""miami golem"" is a lost and undeservedly obscure gem of italian exploitation cinema. make no mistake, this is a pretty bad movie! the events only become endurable if you accept the stupidity and incoherence of the plot and if you don't succeed in that, well than this is just a non-stop spitfire of negative aspects. the acting performances are painfully awful. particularly b-movie veteran john ireland, as the archetypal james bond villainous character, doesn't seem the least interested in the script. you can tell from his grimaces and by the way he delivers his lines that he also thinks the whole production is retarded and simply signed up for the paycheck. laura trotter is probably the least sexy female lust-object ever, and the person who drew the marvelously chaotic vhs cover must have felt exactly the same way, because the ravishing girl on the cover does not appear anywhere in the movie. what an embarrassment this must be for mrs. trotter. still, her completely gratuitous nudity sequences compensate for this, as she's quite hot from the neck down. and, finally, there's the unforgettable scene where david warbeck takes down a helicopter from a moving school bus with a regular pistol! i don't think even john rambo can do this, while he's a beefcake vietnam veteran and warbeck's character is a simple tv-reporter.",0
"a director and his crew head out to the isolated beal mansion, to make a low-budget horror film about the seven mysterious deaths of the beal family that have occurred there in the last century. even with warnings by the caretaker, the director pays no attention to the supposedly cursed house. one of the crew find a book titled tibetan book of the dead, and use some of the passages from it for their script. but in doing so, when red they raise a ghoul from its grave.  boring, confusing and tacky all rolled up into one, equals this penniless midnight horror production. what feels like an eternity, it just never seems to get going or demonstrate anything effective from somewhat decent ideas. even though director paul harrison's clunky, tensionless direction did construct a couple eerie, moody and atmospheric set-pieces. but laziness did set it early. the whole film within a film structure takes up most of the movie and in this time little to nothing happens of great interest. nor is it fun. think of bob clark's ""children shouldn't play with dead things (1972)"", and now we've got older actors in the part. however i found ""seven corpses"" to be inferior. the script early on has some cutting wit abound, before it ends up being drab, predictable and left with many unfulfilled possibilities. the cheap foundation involving limited sets didn't help matters either, but the mansion's dreary, dark appearance had a creepy air to it. performances from a recognizable b-cast is mainly rigid. john carradine in small part mainly lurks about. john ireland plays a hot-headed director, faith domergue's washed-up actress demands attention and charles macaulay hams it up. the slow grinding premise is crossed between ""ten little indians"" and your usual zombie set-up. however its not all that engaging, even with its occult and supernatural edge. hell they even throw in some graveyard action, with no prevail. when the rotting ghoul makes its appearance finally, but a bit late. it does get a little better, if very baffling. just like the inspired opening, the ending is deliciously downbeat. to bad in between, it constantly drags. continuity in many scenes comes across non-existent, and the death scenes are more exciting and bloodier (but indeed poorly executed) in the movie they're making, then what actually happens to them when the zombie appears. the generic music score flounders on with its shuddery, but frank gothic cues, and the camera-work is blandly staged with a lack of imagination. shoot and frame. shoot and frame. job done. that's a wrap.",0
"in the comic, modesty is strong. alexandra staden who plays modesty blaise looks more like an anorectic fashion model. she does not either have the moral or personality that modesty have in the comics. modesty would never give a woman an advice to show more skin to earn more money. i cannot see any similarities with my comic books with modesty and this movie. its like a mission impossible movie would be about ethan hunt locked in the detention room in high school talking with the janitor about when he went to junior high school and hunt would have been played by dj qualls (in road trip). soo if you are an modesty fan do not see the movie you will just get angry. if do not know much about the modesty comics rent an other movie do not wast your time with this one.i cannot understand how quentin tarantino can put his name on it. i will ask for a refund at my dvd rent store tomorrow.",0

"remember a film you seemed to enjoy in the past that doesn't quite meet those same feelings as an adult? that occurred to me when i went back to school..the national lampoon's class reunion. the film has a perfect opportunity for laughs, but surprisingly wanders aimlessly as we see a bizarre collection of characters such a woman who sold her soul to the devil and can shoot out flames of fire from her mouth, a man who appears to be a vampire, and a lunatic killer dressed as a woman and wears sacks over his head. you have the class president who believes he's the best thing since sliced bread(but as we see in the film, he's a coward and joke), a couple of pot smokers who don't even know they are at their own class reunion, and a man named gary for whom know one even knew existed(and no one can seem to remember his name..this is the one running joke i enjoyed). there is a plump pervert who likes to grab women in inappropriate places, a deaf and blind woman who has a screeching holler when calling for her dog, and the cook(you know her from ""goonies"" and ""throw mama from the train"")who loves to place food on people's plates with her hands! the film is essentially about a nutcase who is(or at least attempting to)taking revenge on his classmates for a gag they pulled on him(they arranged for him to sleep with his own twin sister!). the film follows the characters as they search for the killer canvasing darkened, trashed hallways of the old high school. they were told of the killer by his psychologist who seems a bit odd himself. the film has a few good gags that work(pretty much early on), but the film slowly gets worse each passing minute. the film's true problem is that it really doesn't know where to go. the film is pretty much a one-joke premise for it has unassured direction..if it really has any direction at all. the cast is enthusiastic enough, but the material they are to make funny just doesn't have the quality to hold any interest. it's a curio for fans of early 80's comedy relics that are forgotten(this one rightfully so).",0
my brother brought this movie home from the rental store and i remember expecting it to be such a bore. i think the title especially put me off. i can't ever remember starting a movie with such low expectations and being so completely won over. i watched the movie twice before i let my brother take it back to the store. it is very infrequent that a movie speaks to me the way this one did. i was completely caught up in ruby's situation as she tries to make her way through her life. the bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. i could have kept watching for hours. another downside is that i have been unsatisfied with everything ashley judd has done since. she is so perfect in this movie. this film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.,1
"===minor spoilers===   i am, like many others, a huge jerry bruckheimer fan. so when i saw all the beautiful posters hanging out front, and the trailer coming by before mi:2, expectations were rising. a jerry bruckheimer production. big cars. nic cage and fresh from an oscar- angelina jolie. what can possibly go wrong? a lot.   the script is neither funny (which it tries really hard to be) nor exciting. you put in a black person who is constantly making racist jokes about himself and wooh-haa!! you've got comedy? i don't think so. excitement is totally out of the picture. first of all (and this is probably said many times) there are no sympathetic characters so who cares who gets killed? if you can stomach the premise that a psycho is gonna kill nic's brother unless he steals 50 cars in 4 days, next thing you know is that kip (the brother) is walking with nic in the streets again. is this excitement? think not. then comes the best bit- the romance between nic and angelina. she actually looks bored having to utter all these stupid lines to nic. 'do you have a girlfriend?' 'are you seeing anybody?' 'what went wrong?' etc.  then there's only one sparkle of hope left: the car chases. they're disappointing to say the least, because the trailer made it look like it was full of them, and there's only one. a very long one, caught in irritatingly hectic camera movement. i really had trouble following the action.  so is it an action movie? a thriller? a romantic comedy? - there's no need to decide, just avoid this horrible mess. i'll give 3 out of 10 stars, and i feel like i'm being generous.",0
"if you have seen friends, the writing will feel very familiar. especially the last 3 or 4 seasons of friends often share the same comedy setups.  the show is about a group of people whose connection is that they shared the same class when they were still rather young (about 10 years old i think). now, they're in their mid-twenties, and they meet again on a class reunion. this is where the series starts.  a typical episode deals with multiple story lines at once. they're usually not connected in any way. each story line is cut up into multiple sections, which are then shown in a mixed order.  the sketches is where my problems lie with this series. as in the later seasons of friends, it's often a rather silly setting with hard to believe situations. one of the main characters does something really stupid that's hard to believe. the situation is then heavily exaggerated, as if it wasn't silly enough. if you're into this kind of in-your-face humor, then maybe you'll like this series. for me it is a great turn-off.  the reason i started watching friends is because of the first few seasons. there are interesting and especially credible story lines, with some romance in it that makes you root for the characters. the class has none of this. the characters are simply too forced and stereotypes are pushed too far. it's therefore not possible to relate to them and like them.  at least with friends, it took several seasons before it ran out of steam and the character traits were all milked out. but in the class, it seems it has run out of steam before it even started.",0
"i've almost forever been against the inclusion of songs in a movie. my belief was that the quality of the film would automatically be improved if only those extremely annoying songs would be axed. however, things have quickly changed after watching that horrible black (no songs) & this movie, page 3 (plenty of songs). while black was weak to an extreme, page 3 delivers a gripping story with some strong acting & good direction. the songs were almost incidental & blended in almost seamlessly with the film. there certainly weren't any women getting sprayed with water for no apparent reason from mysterious water sources while gyrating wildly on the streets at night.  i was pleasantly surprised with the bold and unabashed approach used by the director. there was no glossing over of anything and almost every scene was completely believable.  i'd recommend this films for hindi-speaking people with at least a slight understanding of mumbai life. the former because the english subtitling was below par and contained many errors which, at times, completely reversed the meaning of the actual statement. the latter because you'll definitely appreciate the accuracy of the depiction once you've lived it yourself.  i'd definitely rank this as a work worthy of international recognition. the scenes with the gossiping drivers was a nice touch and it served simultaneously as a source of genuine humour as well as another perspective on the whole mishmash. the movie does fall short in a few places though, where the characters sometimes say the most inexplicable things which detract from the overall direction of the film.  i also thought that a couple of the sadder scenes were not done very well. it was a touch amusing to watch, rather than arouse any feelings of sadness & the whole scene tended to come across as a bit foolish. these are minor issues though, because the film, on the whole, is truly a rare treat to watch.  overall, it's a cynical, pessimistic outlook and a refreshing one at that! actors, not 'heroes' - that's the key. a chance to glimpse believable human beings in an extraordinary setting - everyday life. a behind-the-scenes look at the extent of the depravity and a rare ray of hope for indian cinema.  8/10.",0

"it's a genuine shame that this spin-off tv series inspired by the superior made-for-tv pictures ""the night stalker"" and ""the night strangler"" only lasted a single season and twenty episodes, because at its best this program offered an often winning and highly entertaining blend of sharp cynical humor (carl kolchak's spirited verbal sparring matches with perpetually irascible and long-suffering editor tony vincenzo were always a treat to watch and hear), clever writing, nifty supernatural menaces (gotta love the offbeat and original creatures in ""the spanish moss murders,"" ""the sentry,"" and ""horror in the heights,"" plus you can't go wrong with such tried'n'true fright favorites as zombies, vampires, werewolves, and witches), colorful characters, lively acting from a raft of cool guest stars (legendary biker flick icon william smith got a rare chance to tackle a heroic lead in ""the energy eater"" while other episodes featured great veteran character actors like keenan wynn, john fiedler, john dehner, severn darden, and william daniels in juicy roles), effective moments of genuine suspense (the sewer-set climax of ""the spanish moss murders"" in particular was truly harrowing), and, best of all, the one and only darren mcgavin in peak zesty form as the brash, aggressive, and excitable, but basically decent, brave, and honest small-time chicago, illinois newspaper reporter carl kolchak.  kolchak was the quintessential 70's everyman protagonist, a wily and quick-witted fellow with a strong nose for a tasty scoop and an unfortunate knack for getting into all kinds of trouble. moreover, the occasionally bumbling kolchak was anything but superhuman; he usually either tripped or stumbled while running away from a deadly threat, yet possessed a certain inner strength and courage that enabled him to save the human race time and time again from all kinds of lethal otherworldly foes. kolchak was surrounded by a handful of enjoyable secondary characters: simon oakland was perfect as carl's chronically ill-tempered boss tony vincenzo, jack grinnage as the prissy ron updyke made for an ideal comic foil, ruth mcdevitt was simply delightful as the sweet miss emily cowles, and carol ann susi was likewise a lot of fun as eager beaver rookie monique marmelstein (who alas disappeared after popping up in only three episodes). granted, the show did suffer from lackluster make-up and special effects (the titular lycanthrope in ""the werewolf"" unfortunately resembles a yorkshire terrier!) and the latter episodes boasted a few laughably silly monsters (the headless motorcyclist in ""chopper,"" cathy lee crosby as helen of troy in ""the youth killer'), but even the second-rate shows are redeemed by the program's trademark wickedly sly sardonic wit and mcgavin's boundless vitality and engagingly scrappy presence.",1
"beforehand notification: i'm sure someone is going to accuse me of playing the race card here, but when i saw the preview for this movie, i was thinking ""finally!"" i have yet to see one movie about popular african-influenced dance (be it popular hip hop moves, breaking, or stepping) where the main character was a black woman. i've seen an excessive amount of movies where a non-black woman who knew nothing about hip hop comes fresh to the hood and does a mediocre job of it (breakin, breakin 2, save the last dance, step up), but the black women in the film are almost nonexistent. that always bothered me considering so much of hip hop, african-influenced dance, and breaking was with blacks and latinos in massive amounts in these particular sets and it wasn't always men who performed it, so i felt this movie has been a long time coming. however, the race does not make the film, so i also wanted it to carry a believable plot; the dancing be entertaining; and interesting to watch.  pros: i really enjoyed this film bringing jamaican culture. i can't recall ever seeing a popular, mainstream film where all the main characters were jamaican; had believable accents; and weren't stereotypical with the beanies. the steppers, family, friends, and even the ""thugs"" were all really intelligent, realistic people who were trying to love, live, and survive in the neighborhood they lived in by doing something positive. even when the audience was made aware that the main character's sister chose an alternate lifestyle, it still didn't make the plot stereotypical. i was satisfied with the way it was portrayed. i loved the stepping; the romantic flirty relationship going on between two steppers; the trials that the main character's parents were going through; and how she dealt with coming back to her old neighborhood and dealing with crabs in a barrel. i respected that she was so intelligent and active at the same time, and so many other sistas in the film were handling themselves in the step world. they were all just as excellent as the fellas. i don't see that in too many movies nowadays, at least not those that would be considered black films.  cons: i'm not quite sure why the directors or whoever put the movie together did this, but i question whether they've been to real step shows. whenever the steppers got ready to perform, some hip hop song would play in place of the steppers' hand/feet beats. at a real step show, there is zero need for music, other than to maybe entertain the crowds in between groups. and then when hip hop songs were played, sometimes the beat to the song was off to the beat of the steppers' hands and feet. it was awkward. i was more impressed with the stepping in this movie versus ""stomp the yard"" (another great stepping movie) because the women got to represent as fierce as the guys (in ""stomp the yard,"" meagan good got all of a few seconds of some prissy twirl and hair flip and the (deltas?) let out a chant and a few steps and were cut immediately). even when there were very small scenes, the ladies tore it up, especially in the auto shop, and it was without all that music to drown out their physical music. i know soundtracks have to be sold, but the movie folks could've played the music in other parts of the film.  i'm not a keyshia cole fan, so every time i saw her, all i kept thinking was ""is it written in the script for her to constantly put her hand on her hip when she talks?"" she looked uncomfortable on screen to me. i thought they should've used a host like free or rocsi instead. deray davis was funny as usual though. also, i groaned when i found out that the movie was supposed to be in the ghetto, like stepping couldn't possibly happen anywhere else. hollywood, as usual. however, only a couple of people were portrayed as excessively ignorant due to their neighborhood and losers, which mainstream movies tend to do.  i would've given this movie five stars, but the music playing killed it for me. i definitely plan to buy it when it comes out and hopefully the bonus scenes will include the actual step shows without all the songs.",1

"indian summer! it was very nostalgic for me. i found it funny, heartwarming, and absolutely loved it! anyone who went to camp as a kid and wishes at times they could go back to the ""good ole' days"" for a brief time really needs to see this one! it starts out as 20 years later, a group of old campers returns for a ""reunion"". i won't comment on the plot anymore cause you have to see it for yourself. the actors were great, and it contains an all star cast. everyone in it played a terrific role. you actually felt like you were a part of the movie watching it. alan arkin was especially good in his role as uncle lou. he plays the kind of guy that everyone wishes they had in their lives. this is also a good family movie for the most part. i would suggest this one to anybody in a heartbeat! highly recommended!",1
"despite disney's best efforts, this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams. i was surprised that it didn't strike me as over-sentimental; this movie played fair. dennis quaid was very, very good in the role, which is saying something for a sports movie. i can't recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me; here, everybody looks the part. this movie is surprisingly good, and i predict that it will do surprising business as it is a g-rated movie that doesn't require the viewer to stop thinking. ebert to the contrary, this movie is a success.",1
"investigative reporter darren mcgavin (as carl kolchak) is back; this time, he's after ""the night strangler"". once again, police officials and fellow journalists either disbelieve, or want to cover-up, the supernatural angle. producer-director dan curtis presents the same basic story as his preceding ""night"", with understandably less success.  mr. curtis assembles a fun supporting cast, included are ""dark shadows"" alumni george dicenzo and ivor francis. jo ann pflug (as louise harper) heads up a sexy collection of belly-dancers. and, although i've never seen it mentioned anywhere, that must be roger davis as mr. mcgavin's dining companion in an early scene, feigning disbelief in the existence of vampires!   **** the night strangler (1/16/73) dan curtis ~ darren mcgavin, jo ann pflug, simon oakland, wally cox",0
"bonjour tristesse covers similar ground as 'the member of the wedding.' to wit, a possessive daughter tries to prevent a relationship from forming between a beloved family member and an interloper. while critics love 'member of the wedding,' i find julie harris to be a jumbo-drag and an adenoidal, scenery-chomping thespian in everything she's been in. this portrays irritating, rich idiots as in last year at marienbad, but this time it's a travelogue.  in this preminger movie sequences develop, but characters do not. for the first 30 minutes he's content to blur the father-daughter relationship between seberg and niven, making uncomfortable sexual readings possible. once the conflict is introduced, seberg can't deliver the depth the part requires. kerr pulls rank and turns the film into 'endless love.' seberg's vacuous narration, is like something out of strange interlude - it is not good. i really wish someone other than niven was in his role. he spends so much time normalizing orthodox british behavior in all his movies, he never gets around to the character.  in the most memorable sequence, an evening out dancing becomes a free-for-all in a harbor. bertolucci steals the entire scene for his empty exercise, 'the conformist.' kerr is on board to clasp her hands and portray another major pain (as in black narcissus, night of the iguana, king and i, heaven knows mr. allyson, tea and sympathy, etc. etc.). really, kerr was a horrible actress. i wish every movie with her could end with a fatal car crash, or even better, start with one.  people uncomfortable with ambiguity should avoid this.",0
"i purchased this film for $5 in a bargain bin at my local video store for one reason only, chase masterson, but i should have crumbled up the five, thrown it in a toilet and flushed. the film is about a bunch of twenty somethings that peaked in high school and reunite on the anniversary of their idiot friends death, who got drunk and wandered into the woods and died. there problem is a reptilian monster is hunting them down one by one. the acting is abysmal, these worthless people were apparently cast offs on shows like 90210 and dawsons creek. the directing was on par with a twelve year old and the script was probably done by a thirteen year old. the entire set looks like someone's backyard in malibu. the people on here that have praised this film are obviously friends of the director and/or actors. avoid this pile of garbage at all costs.",0
"i have read the short story by norman maclean, and the movie did justice to norman maclean's writing. my husband tends to reread it occasionally, and i myself have read it over and scenes of the movie keeps coming to mind. we have videos of many of redford s movies and we have watched ""a river runs through it"" many times. redford is part of the ""famdamily"" as he is always around. we never get tired of redford's perception of norman maclean writings, and the beauty of montana. the script reminds me very much of my own upbringing as my father had the same calling as mr. maclean's father. according to ""a river runs through it,"" ""methodists are baptists who can read,"" a line which by the way is not in the short story, but i think that is a funny line! my husband and i are well-read baptists!  i have heard a movie critic state that the pace of this movie is too slow. i disagree. as one search for inner peace, this is the type of movie that will make you contemplate the beauty of nature in three/four rhythm of the metronome. the photography is outstanding! the acting is great. i love the scene where norman and paul as boys talked and wondered whether one could be a fly fisher or a boxer! then as adult paul played by brad pitt (se7ven) is the ""perfect guy"" who needs help with his alcoholism but will not accept it. the same applies to neal burns, who uses worms as bait, he also needed help but would not accept the fact that he needed help. the scene where paul refuses to eat oatmeal and the entire family has to wait an eternity to say grace! finally after hours, they all kneel around the table to say: ""grace!"" and they all leave. but the oatmeal stayed on the plate! that scene where the two love birds and their tattoos on their posteriors! that is funny! the sunburn! the drive back home where jessie burns (emily lloyd) decides to go via the train line! beautiful dialogue when norman proposes to jessie because he wants her to come to chicago with him!  redford himself does a superb job as a narrator. i could not stop myself from comparing brad to the young redford (barefoot in the park). the nominated director, producer, actor, is a visionary who deserves to be praised for his advancement not only in the cinema in the us but around the world. i am glad to live in nineteen hundred because i have seen the beginning of the black and white television, the movies and all the technology and special effects, to be able to watch videos at home and to live in the same century as redford because i have had the chance to see his works. redford needs no special effects to show us the beauty of montana in this masterpiece. the river to me means that line that separates life from death, memories and realities. redford shows the hands of the creator so magnificently and a river runs through it.",1
"going into a movie like i this, i was expecting absolutely nothing entertaining except for a whorde of kills.....what i got was even less.  christmas eve 1947 a kid witnesses his parents doing it while daddy is in a santa suit. horrified, he runs up the stairs and cuts himself. the story begins 33 years later and harry stalling is your normal everyday joe.....cept for the fact he's obsessed with santa. after his boss makes fun of him he goes insane, dressing up like santa and starts killing non-santa believing patrons and his boss. an unruly neighborhood catches up to him and just as they're about to torch him, he drives his van off a cliff.....into the moon. not the best ending i've seen but it was original.  it was a slow paced, boring movie that really had no redeeming quality except when harry went apeshyt on the church goers. there was hardly any gore and even the ""sex"" scenes were toned down.  too boring......4 out of 10",0

the film is exceptional in it's gay iconography and extends this beyond the asthetics to the music and cast. throughout the whole film exists a childlike wonder as seen through the eyes of the main character. her lighthearted take on the world around us is comical and beautiful. in a way it's a slacker movie for girls. watch this is you fancy a relaxing entertaining mid-night movie. buy this if you like diferent takes on the world of media and love combined (?).,1
"i'm not entirely sure rob schmidt qualifies as a ""master"" in the genre of horror, since he previously just directed one horror film called ""wrong turn"" and that one was actually just was slightly above mediocre, but fact is that he made with ""right to die"" one of the best and creepiest episodes of the entire second season of the ""masters of horror"" franchise. there was a similar underdog story in season one, when william malone made on of the best episodes with ""the fair haired child"" even though his other long feature films ""fear dot com"" and ""house on haunted hill"" sucked pretty badly.  the story of ""right to die"" cleverly picks in on the nowadays piping hot social debate of euthanasia, but thankfully also features multiple old-fashioned horror themes like ghostly vengeance, murderous conspiracies, pitch black humor and comic book styled violence. whilst driving home late one night and discussing the husband's continuous adultery, the addison couple are involved in a terrible car accident. cliff walks away from the wreck unharmed but his wife abby is fully burned and needs to be kept alive artificially. whilst cliff and his sleazy attorney (corbin bernsen of ""the dentist"") want to plug the plug on her and sue the car constructor, abbey's mum sets up a giant media campaign to keep her daughter alive as a vegetable and blame everything on cliff. meanwhile abbey's hateful spirit comes back for revenge and kills someone in cliff's surrounding whenever she has a near fatal experience with the medical devices. after a few victims, cliff realizes it might be safer for him to keep his wife alive if he wants to remain alive as well. ""right to die"" is a stupendous episode and exactly the type of stuff i always hoped to see from a tv-series concept like ""masters of horror"". it's violent and gory with a sick & twisted sense of humor and loads of sleaze sequences. the euthanasia theme and the whole obligatory media circus that surrounds it is processed into the script very well, yet without unnecessarily reverting to political standpoints or morality lessons. the atmosphere is suspenseful and the killing sequences are suitably nasty and unsettling. actresses julia anderson and robin sydney both have pretty face and impressively voluptuous racks, which is always a welcome plus, and corbin bernsen is finally offered the chance again to depict a mean-spirited and egocentric bastard. great ""moh"" episode; definitely one of the highlights of both seasons.",1
"with films like ""wallace & gromit"" and ""chicken run"" under their belt, the good people from the other side of the pond, aardman animation, are now introducing us to a bit of their twisted humor in the form of ""creature comforts"".  derived from a short done early in their careers, ""creature comforts"" is a slice-of-life show where snippets of conversation are removed from their context and given to an animal of some sort.  aardman animation went across the country interviewing people with innocuous questions such as, ""are you a liar?"" and then speed things up a bit asking about their sex lives.  the answers, while seeming to be boring and mundane, are actually quite funny, when you understand the dialogs come first and the animals are added later.  how many of these animals look like the person making the statements? one of the characters discussing what he looks for in a woman, ""i like them kind of thin."" is an insect, the walking stick.  there are two dogs discussing odors and smells, while sniffing the behind of a poodle, as they talk about the different smells of a woman.  there are two birds in a cage. as the ""wife"" tells the litany that is her health, her long suffering husband stands by her, saying nothing.  while it might take some time for ""creature comforts"" to find it's ""legs"", it should find a place on television for those who are tired of the ordinary. while there are more reality shows than carter has liver pills, ""creature comforts"" is one of a kind and definitely worth watching.  some of the humor might seem a little racy, it's the claymation that catches the attention of the children (like the old batman series of the 60's, the jokes are subtle enough the kids won't get them) and it's the jokes that are there for the adults.",1
"this movie was like a bad train wreck, as horrible as it was, you still had to continue to watch. my boyfriend and i rented it and wasted two hours of our day. now don't get me wrong, the acting is good. just the movie as a whole just enraged both of us. there wasn't anything positive or good about this scenario. after this movie, i had to go rent something else that was a little lighter. jennifer tilly is as usual a very dramatic actress. her character seems manic and not all there. darryl hannah, though over played, she does a wonderful job playing out the situation she is in. more than once i found myself yelling at the tv telling her to fight back or to get violent. all in all, very violent movie...not for the faint of heart.",0
"i'm certainly glad that a film was made about carl brashear's amazing life story. coming as it did during the civil rights era, brashear became an inspiration for people of all minority groups not willing to settle for a status expected.  brashear as played by cuba gooding, jr. leads by example in the conduct of the life he has chosen. very similar to jackie robinson who integrated baseball and made it stick by his character and conduct. as brashear, gooding knows that he does not want the sharecropper life that his father carl lumbly has and lumbly makes it real clear to get more out of life than he's gotten.  but while harry truman integrated the armed services after world war ii, the navy still has its restrictions. a black man can only be a cook or an officer's valet, the real fighting parts are denied him. that's not good enough for gooding who applies to become a navy deep sea diver.  once at the diving school at bayonne, new jersey, gooding gets it all thrown at him, mostly by the master chief petty officer in charge, robert deniro. deniro may have some leftover prejudices, but he's nevertheless a hero and one who can inspire if one can get passed racial divide.  the best thing about men of honor is the chemistry between deniro and gooding. they certainly come from different places, but as they get to know each other, both turn out to be men of honor.  other good performances to note are charlize theron as deniro's wife and hal holbrook as the head of the diving school, a guy the navy just wish would retire for reasons you'll see.  men of honor is an inspiring story about people with courage to spare and the ability to change.",1
"some people don't like the animation. personally, i think the animation was quite remarkable given when this movie was done. there are lots of older cartoons that i just love. my problems with this movie are not the animation, but basically the way it was constructed. the characters are all just... well, goofy. and for this movie, they shouldn't be. apparently, everyone in lotr has a limping problem (for starters.) just the way they acted in general annoyed me. my two sisters and i were laughing through most of this movie. i think that if many people had seen this before seeing the newer ones, they wouldn't have gone. i'm glad i rented this and didn't buy it. there are few movies that give me a headache. this was one of them. however, this isn't the worst movie i've ever seen, although it ranks up there. or down there, depending on your view.",0

not a bad martial arts film. fight scenes were good. michel qissi did a good job directing his first film without van damme. story worked without foul language and too much blood. screenwriter jeanette francessca has a good line to the story that works. it would be great to see something else from her in the same genre. she likes the art and having strong women promenant. it was definitely worth watching. i recommend the film to all drama and martial arts lovers.,1
"god, i was bored out of my head as i watched this pilot. i had been expecting a lot from it, as i'm a huge fan of james cameron (and not just since ""titanic"", i might add), and his name in the credits i thought would be a guarantee of quality (then again, he also wrote the leaden strange days..). but the thing failed miserably at grabbing my attention at any point of its almost two hours of duration. in all that time, it barely went beyond its two line synopsis, and i would be very hard pressed to try to figure out any kind of coherent plot out of all the mess of strands that went nowhere. on top of that, i don't think the acrobatics outdid even those of any regular ""a-team"" episode. as for alba, yes, she is gorgeous, of course, but the fact that she only displays one single facial expression the entire movie (pouty and surly), makes me also get bored of her ""gal wit an attitude"" schtick pretty soon. you can count me out of this one, mr. cameron!",0
"personally, i find the movie to be quite a good watch. it outlines the actual situation of triads in hong kong and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organized.  not only that, it also shows the viewer how the hong kong police control the triad situation and why the police don't just go all out and wipe out triads.  overall, the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings & torture. nevertheless, the movie stays true to the real world, thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happens.  i'd recommend this movie to any triad/mafia movie fan. another good watch would be dragon squad. that movie has more guns than this, as in this movie there's more knives than guns (in fact i don't remember seeing a single gun).",1

"this film is one of the best of all time, certainly in the horror genre. the claustrophobic atmosphere is outstanding, the music is just as good as the film and the killer is as creepy as can be! actors are fantastic, rip donald pleasance you were fantastic as dr loomis, he made the film even better. without him the film would be missing a vital ingredient. jamie lee curtis is also superb as our beloved scream queen! her innocence makes her unaware of the real evil that is after her until she finds her friends grossly murdered in the house, which of course is one of the films best scenes. she gives a tremendous performance. i loved this film since it scared me like hell back when i seen it in the very early 80's and i still watch it to this day as it is a marvellous movie that just brings you in to this world were you could be gutted like a fish at every turn! the fact that it is a simple format of a mad man in a mask whom has escaped from a mental asylum and ready to kill everyone in sight without them having any idea that he is there, is just shockingly terrifying and indulges you even more into the movie as the events though fiction could easily be come true. we all know that unfortunately evil does exist in this world and a mad man with a knife is certainly not uncommon, a very disturbing an deep fear for all of this. death at any turn. halloween of course shows this in it's most terrifying way. horror should be believable, and that is what makes the film enjoyable. it's just a simple story that is made into an excellent and terrifying atmosphere. as well as psycho's superb storyline, both of which i adore, i believe there formats are the best horror has to offer. to me halloween and psycho are the best films i have ever seen and i will watch them all my life and never grow tired of them. halloween is undoubtedly one of the best movies of all time.",1
"nicolas roeg's projects are variable to say the least, but are never less than interesting. ""insignificance"" is obviously, first and foremost, an adapted stageplay: it's wordy and pretty-much 'room-bound'. but, it pays to view this film more than once: the underlying themes are not overtly presented and, what's more, it takes a while to adjust to the juxtaposition and role-reversals of the four protagonists: einstein, mccarthy, munroe, and dimaggio.   einstein is wracked by guilt over hiroshima yet fancies the simplicity of a sexual liaison with munro; munro is sick of being seen as a bimbo and craves intellectual credence; senator mccarthy is at the height of his witch-hunting powers but is an impotent sleazebag; dimaggio is insecure about his celebrity, self-obsessed, and prone to violence. each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. each character has a troubled, abused/abusive past and a questionable future. gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. america's obsession with its postwar cultural icons and mores; the obsessions of the protagonists for something none can have: peace-of-mind and/or happiness.  compared with the theory of relativity, a proposed unified-field theory and, indeed, the cosmos itself, all the aspirations and interactions of roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. yet these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, trust me!) affect us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron-bomb (without naming it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary audience. indeed, all the references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable viewer: one au fait with '50s occurrences/personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century.  this film and its screenplay are either very, very clever, or extremely opaque and pretentious. ultimately, however, probably insignificant.  live long and prosper :)   ",1
"this is not really a zombie film, if we're defining zombies as the dead walking around. here the protagonist, armand louque (played by an unbelievably young dean jagger), gains control of a method to create zombies, though in fact, his 'method' is to mentally project his thoughts and control other living people's minds turning them into hypnotized slaves. this is an interesting concept for a movie, and was done much more effectively by fritz lang in his series of 'dr. mabuse' films, including 'dr. mabuse the gambler' (1922) and 'the testament of dr. mabuse' (1933). here it is unfortunately subordinated to his quest to regain the love of his former fiancée, claire duvall (played by the anne heche look alike with a bad hairdo, dorothy stone) which is really the major theme.  the movie has an intriguing beginning, as louque is sent on a military archaeological expedition to cambodia to end the cult of zombies that came from there. at some type of compound (where we get great 30s sets and clothes) he announces his engagement to claire, and then barely five minutes later, she gives him back his ring declaring her love for his pal, clifford greyson (robert noland). it's unintentionally funny the way they talk to each other without making eye contact. this would have been a great movie for 'mystery science theater 3000', if they hadn't already roasted it.  it's never shown how louque actually learns the 'zombification' secret, but he then uses it to kill his enemies, create a giant army of rifle carrying soldiers and body guards. we won't see such sheer force of will until john agar in 'the brain from planet arous' (1957).  finally claire consents to marry him if he will let greyson live and return to america. louque agrees, but actually turns him into one of his hypnotized slaves. on their wedding night he realizes that claire will only begin to love him if he gives up his 'powers.' to gain her love, he does so, causing the 'revolt' of the title, in which all his slaves awaken and attack his compound and kill him. greyson embraces claire, and we seem to be at the end of a parable: ""whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad.""   so really then, it's not that bad of a film, despite the low imdb rating it currently has. on repeated viewings (?) one can see the artistry in the well formed script! dean jagger had yet to develop into a good actor, and is almost unrecognizable in his youngness -- is that really his own hair? we remember him more for his bald, old man roles in 'white christmas' (1954), 'x the unknown' (1956) and 'king creole' (1958). the story borrows a lot of its basic themes from the halperin brothers better, earlier film 'white zombie' (1932) in which hapless robert frazier (as charles beaumont) uses 'zombification' to win the love of madge bellamy (as madeline parker).  if you want real zombie movies (of which there are hundreds!) i'd start with 'white zombie' (1932), 'king of the zombies' (1941), 'i walked with a zombie' (1943), 'night of the living dead' (1968), 'the last man on earth' (1964) and its two remakes. in the modern era of classy films, there are 'horror express' (1972), 'the serpent and the rainbow' (1988), '28 days later' (2002) and its sequel, as well as many, many, others too numerous to mention.  this one is not really a zombie film. judging this movie on its own terms, it's more of a semi-gothic romance. as such it ranks a little below some of universal's bottom billed b horror movies of the late 30s and early 40s. so i'll give it a 5.",0
will smith is one of the best actors of all time. i don't know how he does it. i read books constantly but if there is a movie with will smith i will watch it. he has a rare gift of pulling you into the movie and holding you there. this movie is one of the best movies i have seen yet. i watched it on saturday and i still cannot get it out of my head. amazing and sad all at the same time. thanks again will. you must watch this movie from beginning to end to understand every part of the movie. you cannot miss a thing. make sure you have plenty of kleenex and your man/woman sitting next to you so you can cuddle. well worth the money that you will pay to watch it.. don't wait for it to come on tv.,1

"i really do fail to see the actual surplus value of this movie. it's not bad enough to be hilarious. there's no sleaze or gratuitous nudity (although there was plenty of opportunity). there's no gore. there's no suspense in the first hour of the movie 'cause there's way to much scenes of tourist having a party and natives playing funky tribal music. that last part was actually funny on many occasions: you see these natives hitting congas and 'jembés' and that's indeed what you hear (badly synchronized) on the soundtrack. but they also added this funky bass-line on the soundtrack. so, where was the bass-player? at one point the natives get angry and start killing the tourists. why all of the sudden? it's supposed to be because the evil white men build this tourist complex, which according to their myth awakened the wrath of the river-alligator-god (i actually missed the explanation for that one). but the natives did help for several months to build the tourist complex, so why the sudden angriness? and how in the hell did they manage to push the helicopter in the water??? it's all silly and pointless. this movie also features the skinniest afro-american model i've ever seen.  at one point our heroic leading couple visits this cave where a weird, crazy old man lives. the only point to that scene is that they make the ""shocking"" discovery that the killer-crocodile is actually an alligator. crocodile or alligator, what's the difference? it's big, it's made out of plastic and it eats people. all the same to me. the alligator is a rather silly creation. it's very stiff & motionless and doesn't even flap its feet when it swims. the eyes don't even move when they're shot in close-up. i guess they didn't know 'animatronics' back then in italy during 1979. there's also a lot of pointless inter-cut shots of the local wildlife. i suspect it's stock footage.  like, i said, the first hour was pretty lame and the only reason i didn't switch off the movie was because my cat was asleep on my lap and i didn't want to wake the sweet thing. but the last half hour of the movie did get better. we finally get to see some action when the alligator swims through a horde of panicking people snapping its teeth and munching on them. the most entertaining (and at the same time funny) scene is when alice and daniel drive a van over a bridge and it collapses. we're looking at a matchbox-version of the van falling in the river here. funny. but nicely shot. in fact there are several other nice traveling camera-moves. surprisingly for this type of flick. i was gonna point out some stupid details concerning the end of the movie, but i don't wanna spoil it completely, in case you do decide to watch this movie. my advice is to stay away from it. if you wanna see a decent alligator movie, then see lewis teague's alligator. i admit, that one isn't italian and isn't a jaws rip-off, but it certainly is more fun. and if you're interested in other movies made by director sergio martino, then i strongly recommend the highly entertaining 2019: after the fall of new york. that one's an over-the-top rip-off of every possible existing post-apocalyptic-future-of-doom-movie. ""italians"" and ""rip-offs"", two words that go together very well.",0
"i read several mixed reviews and several of them downright trashed the movie. i originally became interested in this project because it was being directed by tony scott and i have become very interested in his work after man on fire had such a profound impact on me. before i start my review, let me first say this...it's wonderful to see that this movie could have been told in a boring and ordinary manner, yet the writers and scott chose a different approach.  plot:  simply stated, it's not boring. most hollywood movies give 'tried and true' plots that they know will connect with people, often ensuring the audiences acceptance of the film and creating a higher probability of profit. this plot was one of the more interesting ones i had seen in a while. just for reference, i recently watched 'the weather man' and 'lord of war' and while i will say that these movies are excellent, and i enjoyed them both tremendously, both the plots in these movies are boring and they are told exactly how you would expect them to be told. they don't take any chances whatsoever, and they are extremely predictable after you've watched a fair amount of american films. domino's plot is both interesting and told in a manner that keeps you thinking, ""oh man, they're screwed now"". and i feel that has been lacking in a lot of recent films. it has a lot of depth to it, in my opinion, and gives you plenty of things to question while watching it. overall, this is what kept me so interested in the movie.  characters:  i felt that the characters were accurate. knightley did a wonderful job of portraying a beautiful woman, who was anything but on the inside and wanted to be viewed as what she was. it was obvious that she wanted to prove herself and she took whatever means she had to accomplish that.  choco was also very believable, his use of spanish in inappropriate situations, his reactions to domino's lack of affection, as well as his jealousy issues within the team...they all rang true to me, which made me feel that his character was that much more realistic.  rourke's character was the least interesting to me, but it still rang true to me. he seemed like an ordinary guy, trying to make ends meet. i hope that's what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with him because that's what i got out of it. he did a very good job of showing ed in an average joe kind of way that has made his mistakes, yet is still trying to live.  claremont/ladies: i believe that they provided much needed 'heart' to the story. they weren't just people who are out getting money to buy a bentley, these were real people who had a real problem and they sought others mean to accomplish that goal. you could empathize with them because, to them, this child's illness was a problem with no other solution. these characters were supposed to show real people who are less fortunate who got into this mess because they needed help.  the mobsters: they made the story seem sinister in a way that only the mob can. and i really liked that part. they also padded the story with small intricacies that made the plot that much more interesting.  christopher walken/90210 guys:  they provided the comic relief in an otherwise very serious movie. from walken's awkward statements to the ceaseless references to the 90210 guys being has-beens. their involvement in the movie only made it that much more enjoyable.  cinematography....yes....the cinematography. this is where this movie seems to have lost a lot of potential fans. but in my opinion i thought it was genius, the use of the camera to translate the mood of the current situation was extremely effective in my opinion. i considered it a method that was properly realized but could always use improvement, just like anything else. i both applaud and congratulate scott, the editor, the cinematographer and the director of photography on taking some real chances with this movie. not only did they go far and above with its presentation, they went that much further. the use of colors, both extremely light and extremely dark provided the 'look' of the film with a sinister and grungy look that accurately depicts the life of the mob, bounty hunters and the less fortunate in a manner that show that their life isn't as peachy or 'clean' as everyone else. if you notice, in times of less stress or conflict, there were very few camera tricks if any at all. this shows that scott and his crew were trying to achieve something with this look and weren't just doing it for the heck of it. i realize that most people who watched this movie weren't expecting it and it cause many of them to be turned off to this film but i think it was great that scott took this approach. hollywood films have grown predictable and bland. most of them are shot in the same manner with the same twists and turns. and i'm glad that scott tried to make something different.  granted, this movie isn't for everyone, but to say it's trash and has nothing to offer is completely missing the point. i thoroughly enjoyed this film and i'm glad that i spent the money for it. i would recommend this to all, but i'm sure it will only hit a chord with few. i must agree with an earlier poster when he said that many of those who refuse to see outside the 'sphere of mtv' won't appreciate this movie, but i think many people will. we should all try to enjoy it for the fact that scott and co. took some chances and tried to deliver something that was different and unique. and with that in mind, i think he succeeded tremendously.",1
"i expected to enjoy a romantic comedy featuring hip hop, but was disappointed on many levels. first of all, the story is so badly recycled as to make it almost unbearable. second, the setting, acting and story are not very authentic or believable. third, there are a lot more good black actors to choose from than these standard picks. how about some originality? third, there were very few hip hop songs played in entirity - if any. none seemd really central. overall, film was a great disappointment, but the editing style was very interesting and almost made the film worthwhile.",0
"misty ayers had a smoking body, and that's all this movie was about. pure exploitation flick. i started playing a game with myself, counting the number of times they looped the stock orchestral music. and of course the music is completely unrelated to the scenes. case in point: casually walking into a room and saying ""hello"" was scored with chase music from a roman epic. i'd like to know why this film sat on the shelf for 11 years before being released. what i learned from this movie: that women's low-rise panties existed in 1954. i'm talking sigourney weaver in the original alien movie panties. at least 20 of the first 30 minutes is misty leisurely taking off and putting on her clothing (except for bra and panties, sadly). also includes horrendous dubbing, leading to a ""look out! godzirra!"" effect.",0
"i'm sorry to say that there isn't really any way, in my opinion, that an enzo would really be able to keep up with a saleen s7 twin turbo. the power to weight advantage possessed by the s7 would just be too great. the s7 has a power:weight ratio of 3.93 lbs/hp while the enzo has 4.61 lbs/hp. the s7s low end is much better too. sorry ferrari fans but the saleen just gets it done so much better.  as for other parts of this film, i just have to say it's so substandard as to be pathetic. the story is way too weak. the acting in this lemon is worse than daytime soaps.  i can say that as far as it being a treatise on negative psychology its kind of a gem. this film is nothing if not a glaring definition as to what narcissism and sociopathy are all about. its all about these rich punks getting their rocks off while showing only traces of feigned remorse for all the innocent road users they cause injury or death too.  i can't give the film a ""1 star"" rating because it didn't compel me to actually walk out of the theater. i also think that having an amazingly beautiful brunette with killer blue eyes as the leading female saves it from being completely abysmal....although there is no way her singing would put her on the cover of 'variety'.  ps: the guy who plays jason is sooooo the skid row version of james vanderbeek.",0
"after reading through many of the reviews, i don't know what movie some people were watching, but clearly it wasn't the same one i saw.  this movie is horrible. the acting, primarily moore's, is just terrible. the woman cannot act. nice tits, but she just can't act. at no point did she come across as the actual character. instead, it was spoiled hollywood actress goes to the beach to play make-believe with the boys.  and that's what this movie ultimately is -- hollywood make-believe. the training sequences are over the top. the politics -- over the top. the political correctness -- over the top. the combat scenes -- you guessed it, over the top. your mission is to get in and get out without being detected. so what do you do? why shoot off as many rounds and make as much noise as possible, of course. oh g.i. jane, you can be my wing man anytime.  the premise is good, but as soon as hollywood gets a hold of it, we end up with top gun with tits.  what more is to be expected from commercial us films anymore? not much i guess.",0

"i rented this flick for one reason tom savini, i respect his work but this was a real let down, i had horrible clichés, half of the film was naked women so called ""fallen angels"" running around trying to act scary, oh and then there was the occasional ""blair witch"" black and white motion sicken camera scenes. tom's character was really awful, horrible script. and you got to love these lines they use. ""is anyone there, who is out there, this isn't funny"" no but your acting was. i wish i could give this flick a 0! oh the names of the characters. judd, molly, ally, emilio, but they did leave out anthony, the breakfast club reunite in the forest of unforgivable acting.",0
"this movie is a waste of time and money. throughout the entire hour and a half, i continued to wait for it to get better and it never did. it was slow moving, the plot jumped around, it wasn't scary or interesting, and really never amounted to anything. the credits during the introduction were long and drawn out, which was basically like the rest of the movie (long and drawn out). numerous parts of the plot made no sense. several times during the movie i had thought that maybe i had ""zoned out"" because the incongruity of the plot, however, my companion had the same issue and assured me i did not ""zone out"" from boredom, but it was indeed the movie. i've actually never posted on here about a movie before and have been actively looking up movies on imdb for numerous years. so the fact that i'm actually taking the time to write something should speak volumes of how bad this movie is and that you should not waste your time or money on it.",0
"many of the lead characters in hideo gosha's 1969 film ""hitokiri"" (manslayer; aka ""tenchu"" -- heaven's punishment) were actual historical figures (in ""western"" name-order format): ryoma sakamoto, hampeita takechi, shimbei tanaka, izo okada, ____ anenokoji. the name ""hitokiri,"" a historical term, refers to a group of four super-swordsmen who carried out numerous assassinations of key figures in the ruling tokugawa shogunate in the mid-1800s under the orders of takechi, the leader of the ""loyalist"" (i.e. ultra-nationalist, pro-emperor) faction of the tosa clan. what was this struggle about? sad to say, you won't find out in this film. ""brilliant history lesson"" indeed!  no, gosha is much more interested in showing you the usual bloody slicing and dicing and (at absurd length) the inner torment of the not-very-bright killer izo okada than in revealing actual history. sakamoto, for example, was someone of historical significance, considered to be the father of the imperial japanese navy. the closest gosha comes to providing a history lesson is the scene in which sakamoto, whom takechi considers a traitor to the loyalist cause, comes to takechi's mansion to try to sway him ideologically. he begins by talking about the international political situation, with foreign warships in japan's ports and a japan that is too weak militarily to defend against them. want to know more? sorry. gosha cuts off this potentially fascinating lecture in mid sentence(!). so much for informing his audience about a turning point in japanese history.  the film left me in utter confusion about the aims of the two sides in this struggle. for the two and a half centuries that the shogunate held central power in japan, it was an institution dedicated to preventing social change, to preserving the feudal relations of society. it was fearful of outside contamination, both ideological and technological. in keeping with this spirit, it outlawed firearms, those instruments of ""leveling"" in europe and the americas, with which a peasant could have stood up to a samurai. throughout this period, the emperor was nothing more than a spiritual figurehead.  but, in the towns, which stood in neutral zones between the feudal fiefdoms, a new class of merchants, landlords and craftsmen was developing -- the class known in europe by its french name, the bourgeoisie. inevitably, as this new class gained strength, it chafed against the many confines of feudal society. as in europe, the king (emperor) became the central figure in the bourgeoisie's struggle for power against the feudal aristocracy. but a political leadership does not always fully understand the interests of the class it serves. when the outside world arrived with a bang in 1853, in the form of u.s. admiral perry's ""black ships,"" the ruling elite of japan was thrown into a crisis. their military was no match for these foreigners. also, they had heard about the havoc the british and french imperialists were wreaking in china. what should japan do to save itself from the fate of its weak neighbor? surprisingly, some elements within the usually isolationist shogunate were inclined to open trade with the foreigners in order to obtain some of their advanced technology. this is the point of view represented (just barely) in the film by sakamoto. on the other hand, the emperor-loyal ultra-nationalists, represented by takechi, believed they could keep out the foreigners by force, if only they could prevent the other faction from ""selling out the country."" (sound familiar?) thus, the assassination of key shogunate figures is in order -- and away we go.  takechi's motivations were, for me, the film's biggest puzzle. gosha suggests that he is fighting mainly for his personal advancement rather than for the loyalist cause. can we take this to represent the tenor of the loyalists as a whole? (do you care?)  several reviewers have compared this film favorably with ""goyokin,"" which gosha made in the same year. but, where ""goyokin"" is a crackling, suspenseful, adventure yarn, with a hero worthy of sympathy, ""hitokiri"" is plodding, nowhere near as compelling and lacks such a hero. sakamoto could have been this film's hero but we are not allowed to know him -- nor what he stands for -- well enough for him to achieve that status.  in view of his wonderful scores for five previous kurosawa films, masaru sato's score here was very disappointing, sounding like something rejected from a ""bonanza"" episode.  barry freed",0

"i've watched almost all of the gundam/mech anime that have showed in the us and this by far has the best story. the way its plot twists and turns has u riveted. gundam wing is a series that mainly focuses on politics and war. the series follows a group of five 15 year old boys who have been trained to pilot state of the art mobile suits known as gundams. the gundam pilots were trained to battle a powerful insurgency known as oz. as things begin to heat up between oz and the gundam pilots, new political groups will form and old ones will dissipate. old conflicts will end and new ones will arise. to obtain peace the gundam pilots must come to grips with the events taking place in their world and put an end to all the fighting. but, how far are people willing to go to obtain their goal. i recommend this anime to anyone who is looking for a show that has a deep plot.",1
"it's rare that i come across a film this awful, this annoying and this irritating. it is without doubt one of the worst films i've ever seen.  the plot, when it's not a blur of confusing and pointlessly over flashy editing, is ludicrous. why did domino become such a bad-ass tough bitch? because her gold fish died when she was a kid and this ""traumatic"" event left her emotionally stunted, and hating everyone. when the dialogue is not clichéd or banal, it's littered with laughable lines such as: ""there are three kinds of people in this world: the rich... the poor... and everyone else"". at one point the bounty hunters have some guy tied up in the back of their bus who has a combination number tattooed on his arm. because of a confusing mobile phone call, instead of rolling his sleeve up and just reading the number, they blow off his arm with a shotgun. at another point, the bounty hunters take a bomb to a meeting arranged with the mafia and threaten to set the bomb off unless the mafia let them go!? clearly not going to the meeting would have been just too easy.  keira knightley is unconvincing and dreadfully miscast. mickey rourke does manage to salvage some credibility from this mess.  i have enjoyed some of tony scott's previous films, true romance being one, but all i could think while suffering this drivel was that it must have been made by a complete idiot.",0
"i own this movie and have watched it several times throughout the years since it was released. prince doesn't stun us with his phenomenal acting style or anything, he's a musician and i feel like that is what he displayed here, he's just the best one to tell this story through influence. most of this movie is straightforward and teenish but that is the directors/writers fault, still it is a great movie with even better music. the principals and moral convictions in purple rain are quite strong and if more movies would rely on the basics we are taught as young children we would have a better all around environment seeing that art reflects life which reflects art.",1
"although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere, and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days, the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere.  the film is about erroll babbage (gere) who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire. his office thrusts upon him his replacement, allison lowry (claire danes, stardust), who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job. and that job ain't very fun. he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction. allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his ""flock"" of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement. but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren't. he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them. erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants' pasts. it is this ""good justification"" that challenges the audience on some level, letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out-of-touch he's become (by being too close to his job).  when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll's ""area"", he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock. but how could he know? is erroll that good at his job? allison challenges him and erroll pushes back. their battles become as fierce as erroll's need to find this missing girl.  although the set-up for the story was okay, it didn't have any umpf! i will give credit to richard gere, however, who plays the erroll character very well. battling retirement. worried about everyone who's near his flock. disgusted with those he's responsible for overseeing. disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does. quite a change in character portrayal for gere. but beyond him there's not much else. some of the sets are okay (dark and dangerous) but there are so many other problems as to be laughable.  i'll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films. but that suspension has limits. the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes. someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge no-no. or trampling through a crime scene. or moving evidence. it went beyond and hurt the film to no end.  the other damaging part of this film is that we never get into clair danes' character, allison. she's almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we're never privy to what her intension might be: will she stay or leave? will she end up like erroll if she does stay? this isn't a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground, but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up.",0
"ok so a 10 for a 2 1/2 star movie you ask?...well see this one and maybe it will make more sense.. hitchcock never blended scenes together better....the film weaves scenes together flawlessly from the start and yet you don't get that scattered feeling you sometimes get when a movie runs you through the many characters it attempts to develop. you sense that the characters will show you something unusual about themselves and then they don't disappoint you when they do. screenwriter/producer phil hay's surreal tale of life, blended with an absolutely superb soundtrack makes you think more about the 6 degrees of separation in life than the movie by the same title...i will be looking for more good things from this producer in the future.",1
"i remember the original series vividly mostly due to it's unique blend of wry humor and macabre subject matter. kolchak was hard-bitten newsman from the ben hecht school of big-city reporting, and his gritty determination and wise-ass demeanor made even the most mundane episode eminently watchable. my personal fave was ""the spanish moss murders"" due to it's totally original storyline. a poor,troubled cajun youth from louisiana bayou country, takes part in a sleep research experiment, for the purpose of dream analysis. something goes inexplicably wrong, and he literally dreams to life a swamp creature inhabiting the dark folk tales of his youth. this malevolent manifestation seeks out all persons who have wronged the dreamer in his conscious state, and brutally suffocates them to death. kolchak investigates and uncovers this horrible truth, much to the chagrin of police captain joe ""mad dog"" siska(wonderfully essayed by a grumpy keenan wynn)and the head sleep researcher played by second city improv founder, severn darden, to droll, understated perfection. the wickedly funny, harrowing finale takes place in the chicago sewer system, and is a series highlight. kolchak never got any better. timeless.",1

"i am generally more willing to be open minded about rom coms than many, but this was simply not a very good attempt. its got nothing to do with comparisons with the british original -- have not seen, and doubt i will. it has a whole lot to do with a meandering plot, lack of chemistry between the leads and a godawful performance/character from its supposed male lead (jimmy fallon).  fallon walks onto the screen wearing the clothes and hairdo of a 15 year old and acting a decade younger than that. he's supposed to be a teacher you see, and of course its well known that school districts the world over love to hire individuals less mature than the children they purport to teach. the character is so extremely disturbed and irrational that i have my doubts whether any actor could have made him likable, but old reliables like john cusack or adam sandler might have been able to give it a shot. not fallon, who is neither funny, nor an actor, but appears to think he is both. not once in the entire course of the movie do you either believe fallon in his role, or believe that there is any way these two people should, or would be together. near the end of the movie there is a scene where barrymore (who was cute as usual but could not carry this one alone -- its hard to have a one person romance) tells fallon that its over, too much has happened, and she's moving on. and rather than feeling bad about the scene, or sorry for fallon, you are actively cheering her on -- finally she does what she should have done months ago. but of course the plot mechanics won't allow that to be the end of it (an end which actually might have made a statement out of this mess), and instead we get to see the rational career girl throwing it all away to chase after this childish idiot and encourage his delusions. its of course meant to be gooey and satisfying, but it actually made me more disgusted than anything else.",0

"""xizao"", is the tale about the clash of modern life and ancient traditions, and its effects on a family in china. da ming (quanxiu pu), is a businessman who returns home when a letter sent by his brother er ming (wu jiang) makes him believe that his father liu (xu zhu), has died. he founds that his father is still alive, as well as his old neighborhood and his father old business, the public bathroom.  the movie centers around da ming's family, and how he has to learn the importance of his father's job, something he always had considered an old tradition that had to die soon. also, the movie explores his relationship with er ming, who is mentally challenged, and the problems of the small community and how the bathroom is a place that purifies not only their bodies, but also their souls.  the two main themes of the movie, the family and the problems of progress, are incredibly well handled, and the movie never loses the point it is trying to make, both themes are very good developed and we get a glimpse of chinese society and customs.  the director, yang zhang, tells his tale in a simple way, letting the characters characters do the job. it is a very simple approach, but it fits the movie perfectly, and i highly doubt that another style would fit the movie this good. zhang has enormous potential, as he can tell a story without the aid of visual flare or camera tricks.  the acting is outstanding in its naturalistic approach, everyone acts in a very natural way and it almost looks as if they were real persons being filmed. the three lead characters give remarkable performances, and wu jiang as er ming surely steals the show.  even when the movie could had sticked to a patronizing ""old days were much better"" message, instead it takes an attitude of equilibrium, like saying that progress is good, and we must move on, but we must not forget where we came from, and keep an equilibrium between modern life and the traditions of old.  an awesome, and touching film. 8/10",1
"what was an exciting and fairly original series by fox has degraded down to meandering tripe. during the first season, dark angel was on my weekly ""must see"" list, and not just because of jessica alba.  unfortunately, the powers-that-be over at fox decided that they needed to ""fine-tune"" the plotline. within 3 episodes of the season opener, they had totally lost me as a viewer (not even to see jessica alba!). i found the new characters that were added in the second season to be too ridiculous and amateurish. the new plotlines were stretching the continuity and credibility of the show too thin. on one of the second season episodes, they even had max sleeping and dreaming - where the first season stated she biologically couldn't sleep.  the moral of the story (the one that hollywood never gets): if it works, don't screw with it!  azjazz",0
"**warning: possible spoiler**  if you can get by the extremely unpleasant subject matter, this film does offer a heaping helping of outrageously campy melodrama. surprisingly enough, this movie has been copied and ripped-off several times over the years, although it's hard to fathom any filmmaker being inspired by this trashy drama. neither one of the hemingway women can act here (although mariel has improved over the years), anne bancroft offers the only touch of class as a prosecuting attorney, and chris sarandon is by turns pathetic and unintentionally hilarious as the smirking, smarmy bad guy of the piece.  veteran director lamont johnson can't make a silk purse out of this sow's ear of a script, which is stuffed to bursting with howlingly bad dialogue and outlandish situations. for example, the final sequence, where margaux grabs her shotgun and chases sarandon down after his latest shocking act is meant to be exciting but elicits hearty chuckles instead. add a notoriously shrill and spacy musical score by michel polnareff and you have a true guilty pleasure, even though you're likely to feel grubby and needing a hot shower after viewing it. don't say you weren't warned.",0
"in spite of the great future-design touches, the clever asimov premise, and will smith's dependable cool performance, this movie doesn't live up to expectations. the clichés come thick and fast; (waking from a recurring nightmare, maverick cop has his badge revoked by hardass lieutenant, to list more would be spoiling it - you can see the end a mile off). this movie is also stagebound - you never feel that you have travelled anywhere; what's supposed to be a global disaster never leaves an obviously cgi chicago. the robots themselves are good in closeup, but the 'crowd' scenes look more like bad disney -the cgi is overdone again and again. and if you can destroy the robots by smashing them, why do they need to inject 'nanites'? you know it's a duff movie when stupid questions like that start to bother you before the climax. it could have been great, but it's less than the sum of its parts, mainly due to the utterly predictable plot that could have come from any action film of the last forty years.",0

"""night of the living homeless"" was a fairly strong finish to the first half of season 11. obviously a parody of various zombie movies, most notably dawn of the dead, this episode parallels the homeless with the living dead, as creatures who feed and thrive off of spare change rather than brains.  kyle is blamed for the sudden mass outbreak of homeless people when he, out of the goodness of his heart, gives a $20 to a homeless man in front of his house. more homeless people begin to infiltrate south park, until the town is completely overrun with them. this is a very strong randy marsh episode, as he assumes the role of the shotgun-wielding leader of the adults who take refuge on the roof of the park county community center. but before randy makes it to the community center, he is accosted by hundreds of homeless people while hilariously screaming ""i don't have any change!!"" unfortunately, the refugees end up losing gerald broflofski to the homeless, when he tries to escape by catching a bus out of town, and unwittingly tosses away all his change for the bus to distract the homeless people. then he becomes one of them, asking everyone for change.  the boys attempt to find out why there are so many homeless people in south park, and find a man who is a director of homeless studies. they find out that the nearby city of evergreen used to have a similar problem with the homeless, so they escape to evergreen to find out what they did to solve the problem. unfortunately, homeless people break into the man's house, and he attempts to take the easy way out by shooting himself. however, he fails several times, as he shoots himself in the jaw, in the eye, in the chest, in the neck, in the shoulder, screaming horribly until he finally dies. this scene may have been funnier had a similar scene not happened in ""fantastic easter special"" two weeks ago.  meanwhile, a member of the refugees discovers that due to the homeless problem, the property values have nosedived, thus the bank has foreclosed on his house, making him homeless. randy immediately turns on him, holding the gun to the man's head. when the man finally begs the others for a few bucks to help him out, randy pulls the trigger.  in evergreen, the boys find out that the citizens of the town sent the homeless to south park, and that the passing of homeless from town to town happens all over the country. the boys modify a bus that leads the homeless out of south park and takes them all the way to santa monica, california.  the zombie movie parallels and the great randy marsh lines make this one definitely re-watchable. 8/10",1

"this very funny british comedy shows what might happen if a section of london, in this case pimlico, were to declare itself independent from the rest of the uk and its laws, taxes & post-war restrictions. merry mayhem is what would happen.  the explosion of a wartime bomb leads to the discovery of ancient documents which show that pimlico was ceded to the duchy of burgundy centuries ago, a small historical footnote long since forgotten. to the new burgundians, however, this is an unexpected opportunity to live as they please, free from any interference from whitehall.  stanley holloway is excellent as the minor city politician who suddenly finds himself leading one of the world's tiniest nations. dame margaret rutherford is a delight as the history professor who sides with pimlico. others in the stand-out cast include hermione baddeley, paul duplis, naughton wayne, basil radford & sir michael hordern.  welcome to burgundy!",1
"this movie is worth seeing for the visual beauty and moving acting alone, but there also is an interesting cultural subtext of alienation. women and performers (both brought together in a supporting role of a transvestite opera star) are both doomed to be relegated to subserviant roles in china. this makes the unlikely bonding between an aged street performer and a young girl even stronger as a triumph over the native culture.  the only problem i had with this movie was the tendency of the soundtrack to swell up with emotion rendered unnecessary by the actors' performance.  a welcome alternative to unsatisfying summer action movies.",1
"this movie has problems in its presentation, may even be offensive to people who are looking for temporal and cultural faithfulness, but it challenges the watcher to reflect on a variety of issues. one of these is the nature and character of the relationship between jesus and judas. another is that of the historical nature of the bible and faith. and third, is the humanity of jesus. the tension of the christ-betrayer relationship is developed and held through the movie. judas' passion is presented as a darker parallel to that of christ. when judas takes his own life, the viewer can sense the angst. peter's denial and guilt, however moving, are not as powerfully portrayed as the judas drama. chris sarandon offers a novel and provocative christ, whether believable or not. i would like to find this movie on dvd or even vhs, to use in study or discussion groups.",1
"i've seen a lot of movies and rarely would i ever rate a movie ""1"" but this movie was beyond terrible.  the acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous, the effects were unrealistic and the characters were annoying. usually when i watch scary movies i think it's dumb when the characters hears a noise in house/forest/school/etc and then yells out ""hello is anyone there?"" - but at least they're believable when they do it.. this movie couldn't even get that right.  this is a movie that'll make other b-horror movies like venom and the fog look like academy award winning masterpieces.  i always have an open mind while watching movies and i can only say that this movie was a complete waste of time and i write this comment so that anyone else who's thinking of watching this movie will think again. it's awful!",0
"the movie was terrible!!! easily the worst movie i have seen in the past few years. one of those movies i will be able to tell people for the next three years that it was the worst movie i can think of. thank you for giving me an answer to that burning question ""what is the worst movie you have seen?"" answer: celestine prophecy. trust me...i read the book, enjoyed the message and was excited to see the movie, but then, they treated the audience like we are r*tarded. there is no story and the story that is there is crippled by too much magic and coincidence. it is too bad they have to spell out the nine prophecies and can't simply weave them into a story that is entertaining to follow. they didn't spend any time on character development and it was easy to not care if any character died. it was embarrassing to be one of the few people who stuck around until the end of this incredibly boring movie. the book is pretty boring too but i enjoyed the parallels that could be seen in everyday life while you read the book. the film does not offer the same opportunity and i would suggest not seeing it if you want to continue to hold the words of the book close to your heart. don't see this movie. trust me.",0
"my boyfriend and i both enjoyed this film very much. the viewer is swept away from modern life into old japan, while at the same time exposed to very current themes. the characters are realistic and detailed; it has an unpredictable ending and story, which is very refreshing. the story is made up of mini-plots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district. i highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old japan.

"i saw this documentary at the cannes film festival, in a small 200-seat cinema at the top of the main building at the cannes film festival.  i absolutely was into it. i love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes. it is amazing set-design. the scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930ies.  and the music is so nice.  i rate this experience 9/10.  * spoilers ahead *  the documentary tells about awesome blues-men, with black-and-white old-looking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing. it is really amazing. but this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing i might dislike in this documentary. it is the too abundant use of links to modern rock-bands playing those blues songs in a modern way. i didn't really appreciate their trashed way of playing such awesome blues songs. this is the same kind of un-perfect musical taste i found when watching wim wenders buena vista social club.  the documentary was such a standing-ovation at this first screening in the little cinema, that the next day this documentary was shown for everyone and normal tourists on the beach of the croisette at the open-air cinema. though the sand, the quality of the projection and the bad quality of the sound probably made it a difficult experience to enjoy for the thousands of people who were sitting in the sand that night.",1
"first off i'd like to say that if i had to honestly rate this movie from a 1 to a 10, then i'd give it a -4. it's not that i'm a tough critic, it's just that this movie is that bad. everything from the story, to the directing, to the editing is awful. the story is not even halfway decent to begin with (you can't expect much since it is based on a video game, something i was not aware of going into the movie) but the directing and editing made it even worse. the movie cuts at awkward points and goes to scenes that are completely unrelated to the previous ones; some, like a quick sex scene in the middle, don't even make sense being put into the story seeing as how the characters don't show any feelings toward each other. you could go into this movie expecting to see a pile of crap on the screen for an hour and a half and you'd still be disappointed. honestly, if you pay to watch this movie then you are wasting your money, and if you don't pay anything then you are still wasting an hour and a half of your life. so do yourself a favor and don't watch it.",0
"this is a dramatic film in the whole sense of the word. it tells a tail that here in greece we live as a routine in everyday life without realizing how sad it is. sure it has some extremes.. but every now and then real life sorrow surpasses art.it is deeply critical of the goals we pursue and the whole social structure build around them. the film has a deeper understanding of greek ways of life, stereotypes, and social structure. unlike most greek films that have a certain fast-food-mainstream audience, this one does not target anyone in particular but while you watch it you feel that someone put the best possible words and pictures to describe your feelings. i am not a big fan of traditional music either but i wouldn't like to hear anything else when it was played during the film.  if someone told me to say something against this film i'd define the following, sometimes the transition between scenes seemed sudden or somewhat cut. i guess the editing had to cut it up to fit the 2hours and a bit for the theatres..  anyway i could write more and more to express my thought over this but i guess u have to see it and discuss it with a friend. a must see",1

"since this is black history month and i'm reviewing the achievements of many african-americans on film in chronological order, i got this movie on vhs from the library because duke ellington and his orchestra were in it. their jazz version of franz liszt's ""rhapsody"" was the highlight of this mostly overlong murder mystery-musical comedy mixture. many other numbers i liked were kitty carlisle's especially ""sweet marijuana"", carl brisson's ""cocktails for two"" as well as his duet with carlisle on that earlier, and the ones by gertrude michael who's great as the woman you love to hate. jack oakie and victor mclaglen probably go a little too long with their love/hate banter as the producer and detective but they grow on you. and toby wing is a sexy dumb tease as nancy who keeps trying to say something to oakie but gets a ""not now"" from him every time. while many of the characters have a motive for the murders that happen, i wasn't surprised by the revelation of who done it. and get a load of how naked the women here are (though of course their breasts are covered, either by their hands or some flimsy top). this was very obviously pre-code. worth a look for any film buff interested in this sort of thing. p.s. as a long-time louisiana resident, i like noting when someone was born here as carlisle was a new orleans native.",1

"tarantino once remarked on a melodrama from the 1930s called backstreet that ""tragedy is like another character"" in the film. the same could be said- and not withstanding bringing up tarantino- for sidney lumet's best work in years, a melodrama where character is of the utmost concern not simply because of what's at stake with the cast involved. kelly masterson doesn't have a masterpiece of a script here (it basically breaks into crazy killer mode by the end in a series of climactic events that only work by the very end, and even there suspension of disbelief is paramount), but her script does convey character before plot, and in a story where the actions surround a heist it's crucial to know who these people are beat by beat. it's bleak as hell, unforgiving as satan, but also absolutely riveting 90% of the time.  chalk it up not just because lumet knows how to handle a non-linear script where we see the day-to-day actions of character to character before during, and mostly after the botched 'mom-&-pop' jewelry store robbery occurs, but because of the formidable cast assembled (which, i might add, is lumet's specialty). philip seymour hoffman and ethan hawke are brothers with their own respective financial f***-ups, and the former approaches the latter on what looks like a fool-proof heist: looting their own mother and father's jewelry store in westchester. hawke's hank involves another shady character though, murders occur, and suddenly it's tragedy on a greek scale affecting the brothers and their father, played by a perfect albert finney. it's the kind of material that most actors love- characters who, like in dog day afternoon, are painfully human, flawed to the bone but only wanting love &/or things to be set right, and have the complete inability to fulfill their wants and needs.  in this case though hoffman and hawke are matched splendidly; hoffman has, until the aforementioned last ten minutes, a super-calm and occasionally joking demeanor that reveals him as the brains of the operation, but then smaller scenes where he breaks down emotionally (i.e. with finney or the car scene with tomei) push his talents to the limit; hawke, meanwhile, is called a loser by his ex-wife and daughter, can't pay any debts at all, and is called a baby by his own father, and he fills the bill of the part in all the ways that matter- he's not quite as flawed as his older brother, but who wants to pick a straw for that title? and finney, as mentioned, is spot-on all the way through, making his turn in big fish look like child's play (the final scenes with him are terrifyingly tragic, his face recoiling in a horror that has built up all through the second half).  also featuring supporting turns from a finely ditsy and perversely two-timing marisa tomei, bug's michael shannon as bad-ass white trash, and amy ryan, brian f. o'byrne and rosemary harris making brief, exact impressions, this is a film with a tremendous lot of skill and heart- but not a forgiving heart- with a story that doubles back on details not for showy plot devices but to make clear every step of a family's perpetual downward spiral. if it's not as mind-blowing as serpico or network or the pawnbroker or 12 angry men it comes as close as anything lumet's done since.",1
"first off, i hadn't seen ""the blob"" since i was 7 or 8 and viewing it as an adult was an incredible experience. pages could be written on its influence on horror films even today. and even more could be written on its social subtext with the 50s ""fear of teenagers"". but this simple little tale of interplanetary horror is still a damn fine scary movie if you let it be.  sure, it looks cheesy as all get out in our modern world. but ""the blob"" packs in some genuinely frightening moments as a band of kids track the unstoppable creature when then adults don't believe them. in fact, there are even some pretty bleak moments in its candy-colored world. and steve mcqueen gives so much more than the story deserved on paper that we the viewers really get caught in the moment and believe in him.  to sum up, if you can take off your postmodern irony filter, there's a lot more to love here than meets the eye.",1
"i felt obliged to watch this movie all the way through, since i had found it in a bargain bin and bought it for my own, but i came close many times to turning it off and just writing off the money i had paid for it. if you are a fan of gore and sadism, this movie is ok. if there is one thing that the makers of this film know, it is the creative use of fake blood and body parts for a sickening effect. if that doesn't thrill you, then stay away.  this movie is shot on a home video camera, with grade school props and terrible actors. it's dubbed from german, but even allowing for that, the sound is awful. this film is about as budget as budget gets, except for the aforementioned special effects. if they had spent a little more money on actors and a real script instead of blood and guts, the film might have been a little more enjoyable.  the story is about three men that land on an island inhabited by an army of tin-masked sadists. they are captured, and the rest of the movie is about their attempt to escape. i call this a story in the loosest sense, since it is really a series of scenes of torture and combat strung together by inane obscenity-filled dialog.  there is nothing whatsoever redeeming about this movie, unless you like mindless gore. consider yourself warned.",0
"i'm glad the folks at imdb were able to decipher what genre this film falls into. i had a suspicion it was trying to be a comedy, but since it also seems to want to be a dark and solemn melodrama i wasn't sure. for a comedy it is amazingly bereft of even the slightest venture into the realms of humour - right up until the ridiculous ""twist"" ending, which confirms what an utter waste of time the whole movie actually is. it is hard to describe just how amateurish the hazing really is. did anyone involved in this film have any idea at all what they were supposed to be doing? actually worth watching so that you can stare at the screen in slack-jawed disbelief at how terrible it is.",0

"at the time, ""my left foot"" was the little movie that could. it was hugely popular, and everyone applauded the fact that such a small, independent film could make it all the way to the oscars.  since then, movies like ""my left foot"" are a dime a dozen, so it might be hard in retrospect to understand what all the fuss was about. it's certainly a well made and competent film, but it's clear that the bulk of its success rests on the shoulders of daniel day-lewis, who immerses himself in the role of cristy brown, a man living with cerebral palsy. day-lewis pulls off the same bit of stunt acting that had won dustin hoffman an oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in ""rain man,"" and the academy followed suit by giving day-lewis the same honor.  the only thing really separating this film from a big budget hollywood production is just that -- its budget. in every other way it's just as formulaic as any standard product. that's not to say it isn't a good movie, but it's not a masterpiece.  grade: a-",1
"it's the nature of businesses to try to capitalize on others' success. here we have a movie taking elements from the earlier 'dracula' (1931) and 'frankenstein' (1931) -- in a germanic town the village leaders believe that vampires (in the shape of bats) have been the cause of recent deaths of bloodless victims. even though shot at universal (and at the bronson caves!) it's a poverty row feature; it's not fair to compare it with those earlier, more expensively made and superior films.  from the familiar and exciting, chilling music of the main titles (which must have been by mischa bakalienikoff), through the talky but well done opening sequence, we anticipate the arrival of lionel atwill, fay wray and dwight frye to give us a good 30s mystery film. unfortunately, it doesn't happen. that's the disappointment.  we get little more than the formulaic elements of such films but with slow pacing, low budget, not enough of dwight frye, the overdone presence of maude eburne (aunt gussie), and the premise for lionel atwill (dr. von niemann) to require human blood or how he exhibits mind control over his servant emil (robert frazier) never made very clear.  do not watch the technicolor 'dr. x' (1932) -- which also stars lionel atwill and fay wray but as father and daughter -- before watching this the way i did; it's an oscar winner by comparison. so watch this one first. structurally, 'the vampire bat' still isn't that good. it plods along with too much talking or unnecessary comic relief, without focusing strongly on the vampiric villainy.  besides 'dr. x' and 'mystery of the wax museum' (both 1932 and co starring fay wray), lionel atwill's most famous appearances are as the one armed gendarme in 'son of frankenstein' (1939) and as moriarity in 'sherlock holmes and the secret weapon' (1943). dwight frye steals all his manic scenes in 'dracula' (1931). as the 'young lovers,' melvin douglas and fay wray have a nice kissing scene, but that's about it. he can be seen in 'the old dark house' (1932), and fay gets dragged around by joel mccrea in 'the most dangerous game' (1930). then there's her 1933 classic 'screamer.' too bad more time, money and rewrites weren't available for this film to better showcase the talents and chemistry of lionel atwill, fay wray and dwight frye. sadly, then, this drearily disappointing film only gets a 4.",0
"i really enjoyed ""doctor mordrid"". this is a low-budget film, which may be off-putting to some, but i have no problem with it. i admire it even more for that, considering it's way more entertaining than the drivel that hollywood churns out every year. too bad this didn't get a theatrical release; i don't know about anyone else, but i would have went to see it in theatres. `doctor mordrid' is a very entertaining science fiction film that just about anyone can enjoy, especially if they're into sci-fi like i am. i don't see why this is a r-rated film; only one f-word is said, and there are no gruesome death scenes, nor is there any blood at all. the timeless rivalry between sorcerers anton and kabal (anton wanted the use his powers to save the human race, while kabal wanted to enslave them), gave the story a sense of enchantment, while the mythical plotline added charm to the story itself. basically, this a film that's just plain fun to watch. there is one unintentionally funny thing in this movie, though: seeing jeffrey combs keeping a straight face while wearing that silly blue cape and suit. that makes me laugh every time i see it. but i digress... anyway, the acting is great; the main protagonists (anton, and his lady friend, samantha), are very likable; anton is sympathetic, and hospitable, and samantha is friendly. plus, the settings were wonderful. the floating island in the other dimension was very cool setting; we're only given a glimpse of it twice, though; it would have been great to see more scenes take place here. the main setting was also very neat; anton's apartment is very roomy, and he has some cool devices, especially the monitoring system he uses to keep track of the world's occurrences. he even has a pet raven that he keeps in his apartment named edgar. overall, this a great film; it was fun to watch, and the main actors put a lot of feeling into their roles. if you can find anywhere that rents `doctor mordrid', you should rent it (or, in my case, buy it. it was definitely money well-spent)!  my rating: 8 stars out of ten.

"not only was this the most expensive canadian film ever shot in bc, but easily the worst, never seeing the light of day. the director is not even canadian, but british, and boy does it show. we are all made out to be a bunch of over-sexed dope fiends and morons. the spirit of what it means to be canadian is absent, and this is supposed to be the reason we fund this bunk. of course the british character is normal. the rest are a crop of sitcom stereotype - can you say ""norm!!""? the cinematography ranges from pretty postcard images to murky indoor silhouettes. the actors always seem to be fidgetting. are they as bored as the viewer, or is this the directors idea of cinema? avoid this mess and check out some of bruce mcdonalds films. a true canadian boy with something original to say cinematically. you won't be compelled to walk out on his films after 10 minutes.",0
"butch the peacemaker? evidently. after the violent beginning with spike, tom and jerry all swinging away at each other, butch calls a halt and wants to know why. it's a good question.  ""cats can get along with dogs, can't they?"" he asks tom, who nods his head in agreement. ""mice can get along with cats, right?"" jerry nods ""no,"" and then sees that isn't the right answer.  they go inside and butch draws up a ""peace treaty"" (complete with professional artwork!). most of the rest, and the bulk of the cartoon, is the three of them being extremely nice to one another what a refreshing change-of-pace. i found it fun to watch. i can a million of these cartoons in which every beats each other over the head.  anyway, you knew the peace wasn't going to last. a big piece of steak spells the death of the ""peace treaty"" but en route it was nice change and still had some of usual tom & jerry clever humor.",1
"not everything is said in this excellent first feature from céline sciamma. the friendship, the ""wanting to fit in"", the first sexual feelings... all this and much more is sublimated through the underwater synchro swimming scenes.  all three girls in the movie try to find and express their personality in a very different way. it is a much less violent approach to the understanding of the teenage years compared to, say, ""thirteen"", but a very worthwhile trip nonetheless.  a must see, and please leave all american cinematographic preconceptions at he door. the soundtrack is a+ by the way.  bon cinéma !",1
"unbelievable!  this film gets a 7 out 0f 10. this has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years. not only was the acting incredibly bad, the storyline (if you can call it that) was just as bad. offcourse everyone knows what's going to happen within the first 5 minutes. which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment. that however, is not the case. there is no action, no suspense, not even a spark between the 2 leading actors. it was unfortunately a waste of my time, and certainly a waste of my money.   and the 2 of merely for trying",0
"watching this last night it amazed me that fox spent so much money on it and got so little back on their investment. it's the kind of disaster that has to be seen to be believed.  i'm sure that the first morning of filming raquel welch dusted off the shelf over her fireplace to prepare a spot for the academy award she would surely win for this daringly original movie. oops. that's not what happened.  the infighting on the set was detailed in print by rex reed and this helped the movie attain a reputation before it was even released. when it was finally released there wasn't the usual three ring circus of publicity. if i remember correctly, in houston it opened at drive-ins and neighborhood theatres and never played any of the big venues.  i lay most of the blame on director michael sarne, who was hot after having directed (the not all that good) joanna, a film with music about young people in swinging mod london.  if i recall correctly, fox wound up firing him and piecing the film together the best they could. that's why scenes play out in no particular sequence and characters appear and then vanish. an impressive supporting cast (kathleen freeman, jim backus, john carradine, andy devine and others) is wasted with nothing to do.  to expand it to feature length there are numerous clips from fox movies featuring stars like carmen miranda (in amazing footage from the gang's all here) andlaurel and hardy, who never dreamed they'd be playing in an x rated movie.  the x rating is due to occasional language numerous sexual perversions; however, none of the characters seem to be having any fun. maybe somebody involved with the film had a warped puritan sensibility and figured that if they could make these things unappealing it wasn't bad to exploit them.  this was one of the ""youth"" pictures that nearly bankrupted hollywood in the 1970's. one writer joked that easy rider (which was made for pocket change) was the most expensive movie ever made because so many films followed which tried and failed in the worst way to duplicate its success. sixtyish, once honored directors like stanley kramer and otto preminger made movies like rpm and skidoo in an effort to attract a young audience. white directors and writers attempted to make films to attract a black audience. those movies are locked somewhere in a vault and the two named and many others from that genre have never, as best i know, been out on home video or cable. they're the studios' deep dark secret.  raquel welch's performance in this is, all things considered, very good. with the right direction and script she could played the type of sassy liberated women rosiland russel and barbara stanwyck specialized in. she looks great and has awesome costumes. mae west is the liveliest seventy-something actress i've ever seen. on the one hand it's kind of heartbreaking to watch her attempt to capture her glory from years gone by, but i'm sure she needed the money.  if you want to see a big budget x-rated movie from this era check out beyond the valley of the dolls (also from fox) because it doesn't take itself seriously. it's crazy kids playing with the equipment at a major studio. myra breckinridge tries to say something. there just wasn't anyone who wanted to listen.",0
"as you may know, the subject here was to ask eleven directors from all over the world to make each a short movie of 11 minutes, 9 seconds and one frame. we have here : - samira makhmalbaf (iran) : what afghan refugee kids can understand to the towers collapsing ? well, nothing. a great lesson. - claude lelouch (france) : a weak plot with a great cinematography... just imagine a deaf woman living by the wtc who sees without understanding it that her dog barks... well just see it. - youssef chahine (egypt) : the greatest oriental movie maker has compassion... for everyone : for an us soldier who died ten years ago, for the people in the wtc but also for a palestinian suicide-terrorist. maybe the less tender movie towards the us. - danis tanovic (bosnia hrzgovia) : good images, makes us travel, for sure... not a very good plot. idrissa oudraogo (burkina faso) : from one of the poorest country in the world, a tender and funny story about five boys who want to capture osama bin laden... and they could have done it but nobody believes them when they tell they know where he is. ken loach (uk) : september 11, 1973, the chile entered in a twenty-years long bloody dictature. thousands of death, tortures : all that was offered to chile by henry kissinger and the cia, and knowing this changes very much your point of view ! i guess that is because of that particular short that no american movie distribution company accepted to release the movie in us theaters ! loach forgot to point that 1973 is also the year when the wtc was built ! - alejandro gonzalez inarritu (mexico) : impressing images that we all know too well, and a lot of black screens. i didn't get this one very much, it is more an artist video (to show in an exhibition) than a movie. - amos gitaï (israël) : an absurd ballet of policemen, journalists, etc., around a burning car in jerusalem. very well done. - mira nair (india) : about the anti-islamic feeling that followed september the 11th. very good actualy. - sean penn (us) : a funny little story that reminds us a fact usualy forgotten, the wtc did have a huge shadow, and some places now have a daylight they never had. - shohei imamura (japan) : a different one. here there is not even one word about the wtc, and the action takes place at the end of wwii. it has only one message : no war is holy. this short movie gives very deep feelings, but the director aparently would have done better with more than 11 minutes. --- so --- a great movie, a great attempt to take the world's temperature. i love it.",1
"i had an uncle who committed suicide after serving in vietnam because of mental problems he experienced after coming back. so when i saw part of this movie one night on a pay-for-view channel i was intrigued. i wanted to know what my uncle went through and felt as he got ready for vietnam. i went out and rented this movie and i have to say it is the most heart-wrenching film i have ever seen. i bought the dvd immediately after renting it. the way it pulls you in so many different directions emotionally is something i've never experienced with any other film. as far as vietnam subject films go, i think it is the best one, although platoon runs a close second. besides all of that, i think it is also colin farrell's best performance as an actor. i like him in most of his movies but in this one he was incredible. i gave this a 10 rating because it is one of my top five favorite movies.",1
"cute and playful, but lame and cheap. 'munchies' is another gremlins clone to come out from the 80s. i'm not much of a fan of the imitations.  first it was the excellent 'gremlins'.  then came the very average 'critters'.  lets not forget the lousy 'ghoulies'.  but the complete pits would have to go to 'hobgoblins'.  is there more??   now 'munchies' for me would have to fall somewhere between 'ghoulies' and 'hobgoblins'. actually i probably found it more entertaining than 'ghoulies', but i preferred thst one's darker tone.   from the get-go it plays up its goofy nature (which it's better for it), but due to that nature the hammy acting (alix elias and charlie phillips), can get rather overbearing that you rather just see the munchies running amok. that's where the fun occurs. mostly light-hearted fluff though, as the story mainly centres on the munchies (who are either hungry, horny and destructive) in a whole bunch of supposed comical encounters (some moments do work) in the small desert town as a couple of people are on the chase. it's silly, but strangely engaging thanks to the zippy pacing. the creatures themselves look rather bland and poorly detailed, as they're basic dolls being chucked about. where their personalities arrived from is that they can actually speak... and with attitude.  charlie stratton and a feisty nadine van der velde (who was in 'critters') were fair leads. harvey korman was acceptable in two roles. robert picardo also pops up.  amusingly low-cut entertainment for the undemanding.",0
"probably the first portuguese film i have seen in my life, and i enjoyed it. the plot is related of how the young army officers took the power in portugal in 1974, to finally defeat the fascist government of caetano and to also finalize the wars in the colonies, i.e. mozambique, angola, and guinea (bissau)- cape vert. most of the events shown in the film reflect with exactitude the behavior of the army officers and soldiers to conduct the coup, of the oppressed people, who were very happy with this new development and the liberty, the resistance of caetano's men, and also in a subtle way of most conservative officials, including spinola, who took over as the new president. the portuguese revolution can be remembered because of the action of several young officers, but for me the most interesting part of the film was when the young captain expressed that portugal should develop itself democratically, and this is what the country achieved some years after this coup or revolution. the film also shows that the army officers and soldiers never wanted to kill anyone; even the most serious enemies were respected at the end.",1
"audiences back in 1936 must have been stunned at what they were watching: a full-fledged, beautiful full-length technicolor film. i can't say for sure, but this might have been the first one (3-strip). at any rate, it still looks beautiful over 70 years later on dvd. in fact, just how good it looks is amazing.  kudos for that have to go out to director richard boleslowski, director of photography virgil miller, selznick international pictures and, for the dvd - mgm home entertainment. all of them combined to give us one of the best-looking films of the classic-era age.  i thought the story was so-so: excellent in the first half, stagnant in the second. it gave a nice message in the end, even though a lot of people might not have been happy with it. i can't say more without spoiling things.  marlene dietrich never looked better, i don't believe, and certainly never played such a soft-hearted character (""domini enfilden""). heart-throb charles boyer was the male star and domini's object of affection, but some of the minor characters were the most interesting to me. people like joseph schildkraut as ""batouch;"" john carradine as ""the sand diviner;"" the most memorable, to me at least, was the dancer ""irena,"" played by tilly losch. wow, there is a face and a dance you won't soon forget! i've never seen anything like it in the thousands of films i've viewed. just seeing her do her thing was worth the price of the dvd. looking at her imdb resume, she was only in four movies, but they were all well-known films.  basil rathbone, the actor who really became famous for playing ""sherlock holmes,"" also is in here as is c. aubrey smith, another famous british actor of his day. schildkraut, by the way, will be recognized by classic film buffs as the man who played the arrogant sales clerk in the big hit, ""the shop around the corner,"" with jimmy stewart and margaret sullivan.  the beautiful direction, photography and color, and tilly's dance, are the things i'll remember best about this movie which is a lot of good and not-so-good things all rolled into one. had the last half hour been better - although i admire the ending - i would have rated it even higher. it's definitely one film collectors want to add to their collection.",1
"let's see, here are the ""highlights"" of the brain machine: 15 establishing shots of a pool and a house; 15 establishing shots of a nondescript office building; 5 countdowns by a bland technician; 7 close-ups of a menacing guard; and a myriad of technical babble to show us this is a high-tech experiment.  various posters have commented on the discrepancy between the copyright date of 1972 and the release date given on the dvd box of 1977. that's an easy one to explain. this dog simply sat on the shelf unreleased for five years, until someone dusted it off, thinking it fit in perfectly with the post-watergate mood of distrust in government. after seeing the brain machine now, my only wonder is that it ever got released at all!",0
"loved the movie. i even liked most of the actors in it. but, for me ms. davis' very poor attempt at an accent, and her stiff acting really makes an otherwise compelling movie very hard to watch. seriously if any other modern actor played the same role with the same style as ms. davis they would be laughed off the screen.  i really think she 'phoned this one in'. now if it had myrna loy or ingrid bergman playing the part of the wife i would have enjoyed it much more.  i guess i just don't 'get' bette davis. i've always thought of her as an actor that 'plays herself' no matter what role she's in. the possible exception is now voyager.  i'm sure many of the other reviewers will explain in careful (and i hope civil) detail how i am totally wrong on this. but, i'll continue to watch the movies she's in because i like the stories/writing/supporting casts, but, i'll always be thinking, of different actresses that could have done a better job.",1

"noll's comfortable way of rolling out blunt comments, often with expletives, to describe things that he is more knowledgeable about than most is quite refreshing. there is one other character in the film that constantly tries to verbalize complicated issues, using more language than necessary. this guy should never have been given a thesaurus. cut to noll and you know you're in for a treat!  the way the pioneers of big wave surfing are portrayed is very evocative of a ""lost era"". nevermind the fact that no one knows how these guys made a living, much less took care of issues like medical care. the use of old film clips throughout was masterfully done.",1
"bamboo house of dolls (1973, 1974 or 1977, various years are given for this title) is a hong kong veteran chin hung kuei's (killer snakes, boxer's omen, payment in blood etc.) women in prison flick produced by the legendary shaw brothers. yes, even they got their hands into low exploitation sickies like this, and bamboo is definitely among the worse attempts of the whole genre, even when compared to the western attempts that usually pale in comparison with the eastern films!  the story is about a japanese war camp in which the chinese women are brutalized, abused and raped by the bad japanese (what else?) during the world war ii. the girls also know a secret place in which a box full of gold is hidden and also learn that a chinese military officer raised in japan (shaw veteran lo lieh) is actually now an undercover agent among the other japanese and naturally helps the girls escape the hell. what follows is sequences full of gratuitous nudity, female kung fu, some nasty torture, gore, sleaze and extremely offensive anti japan attitude that make this film pure and honest garbage that doesn't even try to be more than it is.  there are hardly any interesting elements in bamboo house of dolls. the occasional photography especially at the end looks nice with its sunbeams and beautiful nature but that's about it in the merits department. the fight scenes are plenty and always include half naked females hitting and kicking each other. the violence overall is quite nasty at times with several bullet wounds, misogynistic torture scenes (for example, one poor girl is brutalized on the floor filled with broken glass etc.) and extremely repulsive ending and moral behind it. of course it is stupid to talk about ""moral"" when writing about this kind of film, but still there are elements i won't accept to be found from any film.  the film has also some enjoyable turkey elements for sure! for example, the gold box, filled with heavy gold, seems suspiciouly light as the weak and suffered girls don't seem to have any problems lifting and moving it, not to speak of throwing it! also those numerous ""skin fight scenes"" make this quite smile inducing for fans of trash cinema. i have seen the same director's killer snakes (1973) which is ten times more noteworthy as a piece and even though it has many alive snakes killed for real, it is also visually more interesting and shows us some nasty sides of the other side of the big city and society. also, it is a must for those who fear snakes.  bamboo house of dolls has suffered some censorship, too, which isn't a surprise considered the subject matter. the uncut version, (dubbed into a non-english language) released in europe at least in france, italy and switzerland, runs 104 pal minutes while the cut, english dubbed print released in holland, belgium and greece runs only 84 minutes in pal. from what i've heard, the cut scenes are not only violence or other graphic stuff but also dialogue and ""plot development"" and the like.  bamboo house of dolls is garbage cinema in its most trashy form and definitely something i wouldn't have liked to see from the shaw brothers or hong kong in general. some of the italian exploitation films of the same subject matter are much more interesting and noteworthy than this quite ridiculous, calculated and worthless piece of cinema exploitation. 2/10",0
"""hak hap"", or ""black mask"" (in english) was a disappointment. i was told that it was a sort of ""japanese version of the matrix"". imagine my disappointment. the film was either badly dubbed or the soundtrack didn't time well with the film. another thing is that the dialogue was pretty much bad. there was very little thought put into the english version of this film and it appeals only to the ""senseless action"" genre. not a film i would want to see again.",0
"at least i was able to enjoy mocking the movie which is surprising since i was barely able to sit through it. in all honesty, my guess is the cover to the dvd case cost more than the entire movie. and saying that it is the same director as the boogeyman, when a new version of that just came out...nice touch guys, it was misleading enough to rope me in. the only thing that frustrated me more than the insufferable acting of the copycat was his haircut. usually you only see that kind of hair on a ten year old boy and the character acted like it. the film looks like it was shot by a d+ grad student of some film school excited to use every film technique he ever learned while attending classes....sometimes, less is more buddy. through out i would get lost by random plot twists that led nowhere or were unexplained. all this makes a bad movie but when the ending doesn't even come close to pulling it together, well, that makes it an exceptionally bad movie. without a doubt this is the worst movie i have ever seen, and that includes my friends' french final video for senior year of high school, but hey maybe i'm a bit biased, i mean i did get to play an extra. p.s. i don't even think this deserves a star...not even a half. none for you!!",0
"i think that this film is brilliant.there are many reasons why but these are some of them 1)the good acting by tom and tyler 2) brilliant machine gun scene that was a piece of brilliance 3) i thought that the ending was a good twist because i never expected that at the end all credit to sam mendes.as well as a these 3 points the film form of the film is good as well. i am a film student at college and we studied this film in great detail and it was one of the best films i have seen in many years. i'd just like to say a big thank you to all of the people involved in making this film. lastly i would like to say the best scene in the film is the machine gun scene where john rooney gets kill it is just pure brilliance in shooting the scene in silence until john rooney says "" i'm glad it's you"" it is a lot better like that i think because the viewer creates there own sound and that sound is totally different for every viewer just brilliant.  thank you for reading this comment written by ross kirk aged 16",1

"when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following. the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside. it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated . on a per capita basis europe, britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per-capta basis the actual size of neo-nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america. it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra-right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society. by doing so greenstreet, deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie. this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology. this film was made for profit not for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition. greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies, the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy. movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash. sensationalism at its worst anti -usa garbage shameful.",0
"new york, i love you finally makes it to our shores, but its 10 short stories on love somehow didn't find reason enough to be released over valentine's, probably due to the fact that this year's festival also falls on lunar new year, and with that comes the usual lny blockbuster films from the likes of jackie chan (no, not the spy next door) and local filmmaker jack neo who has traditionally released his latest film over that period to resounding success. so why fix a formula that hasn't been broken?  continuing in concept where paris, je t'aime had begun in spawning the city of love franchise (shanghai will be next, so says the end of the closing credits here), the buzz here is definitely about the intertwining stories set in one of the cities of the world to allow for various interpretations from filmmakers all over to come up with stories based on love as a theme, although someone probably forgot to tell scarlett johansson some of the finer points in the sandbox ground rules, and her short was unceremoniously dropped from the theatrical edition for being unable to fit into everything else (well, it was shot in black and white), but here's hoping that it would make it to the dvd at least.  structurally, this series is less compartmentalized compared to its predecessor, which if memory serves me right had individual stories set within its own confines and never really breaking out of its artificial borders created. here a little more leeway is given, where characters from various stories interact in short filler segments used to bridge scenes together, and not just solely reliant on pick up shots made up of buildings and landscapes, in hopes of making things look a little bit more serendipitous with the idea of chance encounters amongst strangers, though one story craftily adopted this mindset for its own narrative to deliver a surprise, though already seen in paris.  one of the top draws for sitting through a film like this one, is definitely the creative forces behind the stories, from writers, directors and cinematographers from various geographies and backgrounds mirroring the makeup of the cosmopolitan city, coming together for a concept film. and what more the star-studded cast too, with big names amongst the lesser known ones all upping the ante through picture perfect performances, be it for the entire length of the short, or as a support to build upon. you can't deny the initial star-gazing in recognizing the notables, from irrfan khan to natalie portman (who also had writing and directing duties), rachel bilson (looking quite like bardot) to spielberg's blue eye boy shia labeouf, who surprisingly can act, and shows off more in his few minutes here than his entire filmography to date.  story wise, like any anthology, you'll find some which will automatically appeal to you, and with others that don't. some are straightforward in nature, while others have to come up with gimmicky twists that thankfully worked. but these 10 stories plus 1 (because randall balsmeyer was given duties to integrate everything together for a more organic feel instead of just plain pick up shots of lesser known areas and established landmarks) somehow lacked the more ""anything goes"" spirit from its predecessor, with stories more rooted in reality, compared to some fantastical elements in the previous film (elijah wood's dalliance with a vampire anyone?), or even less adventurous with its narrative style (christopher doyle's, and tom tykwer's starring natalie portman). here it seemed that the filmmakers opted very much for safe, with none venturing into that spirit of adventure and experiment.  minor quibbles aside, i still enjoyed almost all the shorts here, contrary to what many others have felt about it. the short film format is still very much alive, and having them strung together into a feature under the city of love banner works fine, and left me wondering which other cities are or have been included in its lineup. i am hoping that perhaps the franchise will catch on and spread its influence here. we surely have enough prolific filmmakers to be stringing together a singapore, i love you, so here's crossing my fingers that maybe something will materialize down the road. otherwise there's always the sawasdee bangkok route of just making it without any attachments to franchise house rules.",1
"camp blood iii is a vast improvement on camp blood ii as it has sound mostly in the right places and a rudimentary plot. this time they've ventured slightly further away from the car park the other two movies were filmed in which is a good move as you can no longer hear cars driving past what is supposed to be a remote wilderness.  this time around there's a reality tv show and a fake clown to scare off the contestants. this is hardly a new idea, i've seen at least three other horror movies with exactly the same premise where the real killer turns up but at least this one has a plot instead of people just randomly being stabbed with a knife.  unlike the other two in the series this one is at least good for a few laughs. i liked how there's a gunshot sound effect when someone gets stabbed early on and the way the boom mike hovers behind people like a phantom.  i don't know why anyone would want to make a third camp blood film, i would have thought it would be better to start from scratch but they have at least tried with this one. the half naked deformed woman was a bit much for me, it looks like they tried to keep continuity by hiring some freak who would get her clothes off for $5 just like they did in the second movie. they still haven't worked out that a machete is used for cutting not stabbing but oh well, it's a camp blood movie what do you expect? if you like crap films you'll get some fun out of this one.",0
"""diary of sex addict"" is a pathetic attempt at a serious drama about sexual compulsiveness. probably a movie marketing scam, this flick is a stylish shoot with a good cast and little else going for it. bottom line, ""diary..."" would have us believe that our sex addict character has the dumbest wife in the world, a stable of babes on the side who have nothing better to do than drop their panties for him at his whim, and no job in spite of being a restaurateur. at the best, this flick could have been good drama. at the worst, cheap softcore.

"chillers starts on a cold, dark stormy night as a bus drops off three passenger's outside a bus station, a young boy named mason (jesse emery), a college professor dr. howard conrow (david wohl) & a woman named sharon phillips (laurie pennington). inside they discover that they have missed their connecting bus & are stranded for the night. in the waiting area they find two other people, ronnie (jim wolf) & a sleeping woman named lindsay (marjorie fitzsimmons) who is currently having a terrifying nightmare...  while swimming in an indoor pool lindsay encounters & befriends guy named billy waters (jesse johnson), the next time lindsay sees billy he dives into the pool & then seemingly disappears into thin air before he surfaces. shortly after lindsay discovers that billy water died in a diving accident 5 years ago...  lindsay wakes up & tells the others about her nightmare, everyone else responds by saying that they too have suffered disturbing dreams recently & decide to share them to pass the time...  next up is mason who tells a story of how he & two friends, scott (david r. hamm) & jimmy (will tuckwiller), are terrorised during a camping trip...  then it's sharon whose story revolves around a newsman named tom williams (thom delventhal) who she phones up, in no time at all tom is at her front door but he actually turns out to be a vampire...  it's ronnie's turn next & he describes how he discovers that he can bring the dead back to life, unfortunately he brings executed mass murderer nelson caulder (bradford boll) back to homicidal life...  finally dr. conrow tells a tale of how two of his students brought an ancient aztec war-god named ixpe (kimberly harbour) back to life...  then it's back to the bus station for one last (predictable) twist...  written, produced & directed by daniel boyd chillers is one of the worst horror anthologies i've ever seen & i usually really like this sub-genre. the script by boyd lacks what is needed for films such as chillers to work, you can see the final twist coming a mile off & each story is really lame. the first one is totally pointless & didn't seem to have an ending & the best thing about these anthologies are the short snappy stories that are rounded off with a neat twist. the second story is predictable &, again, just ends without any payoff. so it continues throughout chillers that each story is deeply unsatisfying to watch & have no reward for doing so. the character's & dialogue are poorly written, the stories seem to have no original ideas of their own & as a whole the film totally sucks. at least each story doesn't last long & i liked the idea behind the linking segments.  director boyd was obviously working with a very low budget & it shows. all i can say is if you want to watch a 15 odd minute short story set entirely within a swimming pool then chillers is for you. the stories are neither clever, scary or have any sort of tension or build up to anything. having said that it does have a few nice scenes & some surprising competence shines through on occasion. violence & gore wise there isn't much happening in chillers, a ripped out heart, a decapitated head & a bitten off hand is as gory as it gets.  technically chillers is poor stuff that won't impress anyone. basic cinematography, bad music, cheap special effects & below average production values. chillers also features one of the worst closing theme songs ever, period. the acting is also of a very low standard.  i am sure a lot of effort was put into chillers as a low budget film & at least the filmmakers tried so i will give credit for that at least, but that still doesn't stop me from thinking it's crap. similar anthology films like tales from the crypt (1972), asylum (1972), the vault of horror (1973), dr. terror's house of horrors (1965), creepshow (1982) & tales from the darkside: the movie (1990) are far superior to chillers so watch one of those instead.",0
"slashers.....well if you like horrors its definitely one to see, otherwise don't even bother.it is completely obvious that this film has an extremely low budget, for instance it looks as if the entire film has been shot in a warehouse somewhere, and on numerous occasions you will see the mike boom shadow and the camera mans shadow, trust me you wont need to look for them.also try to ignore the cheesy actors, if thats what you call them!!the basic outline is a few people decide to go on a game show where they have to survive a night in a big maze due to their being 3 killers on the loose and whoever live's at the end gets rich. now there is something about this film that keeps you watching and rarely do you find that with a cheap budget horror these days,for example when i watched it i thought to my self i would'nt mind having a go at this game! especially for $12.000.000. so anyway i would recommend you watch it and make up your own mind.",0
"although time has revealed how some of the effects were done this story of love and adventure still is special.  if you've never seen this film before you'll be shocked at how much has been stolen by later film makers. i was watching this with a friend who was amazed at how much disney's aladdin cribbed from the film. they loved the movie and enjoyed that it was such a touchstone for so many other films and film makers.  i've given the film an 8 out of 10 instead of a 10 out of ten, which is where a good portion of this film dwells, because in the final 15 minutes the film falls apart in the pacing. everything is rushed as if they has to suddenly get to the end. from the point from the departure of the djinn to the end it appears to be more sketch then finished painting. it doesn't kill the film, but it does weaken it.  still its required viewing for anyone who loves a good fairy tale, or even a great movie.",1
"allow me to just get to the bottom line here: i've got 3 kids, ages 5 to 10. i consider a trip to the theater a success when there are no talking animals. i've seen most of the children's videos in our collection at least 72 times. i can tell you when the film gets reversed in the wizard of oz, the over-18 sexual joke in el dorado and the tragic flaw with the ending of rudolph the red-nosed reindeer. i could probably storyboard nemo from memory alone.  what makes me support the one child of mine (it varies) who suggests this title for the family movie of an evening? in a word: showerman.  moment of silence...  *sigh*",1

"with a title like that, it's above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did not appeal to me. granted, there's a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore, but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse ""shock"" tactics... the inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road. he and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods. he ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement. the heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her, a ""grabby"" neighbor, and her sexually abrasive boss. he explains to her that he is going to kill them all. she winds up killing him and then turning her focus towards the men (or pigs) whom she tortures and kills, herself... most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sh!t eating and genitalia destroying - all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild. the best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful man-rape... surely, ""i spit on your corpse, i p!ss on your grave"" was intended as an unofficial sequel to ""i spit on your grave"" - based on, mainly the title, and a reference the main character gives - suggesting her mother was camille keaton. i personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion! this movie is a boring, amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably...",0
"i am partly a fan of miyazaki's work. i say ""partly"" because most of his films fall into two categories: brilliant, and boring. sadly this film falls into the later category.  this film suffers from the same fundamental problems as miyazaki's recent film ""howl's moving castle"". an intriguing premise is set up, but then immediately reduced to little more than a backdrop for some unfathomable events that only serve to confuse the plot rather than explain it.  the first third of the film reveals the post-apocalyptic world the story is set in, and actually looks like an very interesting story is about to unfold. from then on things go down hill. the middle part of the film is mostly made up of thinly-veiled eco-propaganda, and the ending is heavily marred by the reliance on the kind of impenetrable spiritualism which ruins a large number of japanese animated films.  overall the film feels as though someone ripped out every other page from the script before passing it on the the animators. what is left is something which is visually stunning (although sadly the version i saw was an nth-generation copy, with poor colour - which gives rise to the common myth that nausicaa shows her bare bottom when flying), but which makes little sense and ultimately left me confused.",0

"wow, how bad can it get. this was seriously bad. not in terms of the gore - which was mainly laughable cgi - but in acting, atmosphere and direction.  the story was dreadful - the character arc of the main lead was a total joke. within a few nights of stalking vinnie jones, he starts to become 'haunted' to the point of crying when photographing his girlfriend. um... are all new york photographers this childish, suggestible and weak? his character development had absolutely no justification or point whatsoever - and by the very end you'll be laughing out loud at the utterly predictable, and totally absurd twist his character takes.  the gory moments were clearly just a weak, low-self-esteemed effort to jump onto the modern mtv style gore wagon - all cgi, blood yet no real emotion whatsoever. these parts were unintentionally funny - and distracting by their self-consciousness - wacky camera angles etc.  overall this film commits the crime of blowing another potential idea. what could have had atmosphere (until the stupid monsters at the end) is ruined in favour of 'look at me'style self-conscious directing. this film wasn't made for and audience - it was made for a cv - a deeply selfish motive.",0

"by dane youssef   ""coonskin"" is film, by the one and only ralph bakshi, is reportedly a satirical indictment of blaxploitation films and negative black stereotypes, as well as a look at life black in modern america (modern for the day, i mean--1975). paramount dropped it like a hot potato that just burst into flame.  but this is a bakshi film, controversial, thrilling, and a must-see almost by definition alone. not just another random ""shock-jock"" of a movie which tries to shock for the sake of shock. it's by ralph bakshi. anyone who knows the name knows that if he made a movie, he has something big to say...  although it's roots are based in cheap blaxploitation, ""coonskin"" isn't just another campy knock-off of mainstream white film or any kind of throwaway flick. ""coonskin"" wants to be more. it aims it's sights higher and fries some much bigger fish.  the movie doesn't just poke fun at the genre. nor does it just indict black people, but actually seems to show love, beauty and heart in the strangest places.  ""coonskin"" tells a story out of some convicts awaiting a jail-break. the fact that it's even possible to break out of a prison in the ""coonskin"" world alone makes it old-fashioned.  one of the inmates tells a story about a trio of black brothers in harlem named brother bear, brother rabbit, preacher fox who want respect and a piece of the action and are willing to get it by any means necessary. the itallian mob is running all the real action.  big name black musicians star: barry white and scatman crothers, as well as charles gordone, the first black playwright to take home the pulitzer. something big is happening here obviously.  the movie plays out like a descent into this world, this side of the racial divide. from an angry, hip, deep, soulful black man with a hate in his heart and a gun in his hand.  bakshi's films never know the meaning of the word ""sublety."" this one looks like it's never even heard of the word. but maybe a subject like this needs extremism. real sledgehammer satire. some subjects can't be tackled gently.  bakshi is god-dammed merciless. here, no member or minority of the harlem scene appears unscathed.  the characters here are ""animated"" to ""real"" all depending on what the mood and situation are. the animated characters and the human ones all share the same reality and are meant to be taken just as literally.  bakshi never just shows ugly caricatures just for shock value. he always has something to say. nor is black-face is gratuitously. here, unlike in spike lee's ""bamboozled,"" he seems to be using it to try and really say something.  like 99.9% of all of bakshi's films, this one incorporates animation and live-action. usually at the same time. bakshki isn't just being gimmicky here. all of this technique is all intertwined, meshing together while saying something.  somehow, this one feels inevitably dated. many of these types of films (bakshi's included) are very topical, very spur of the moment. they reflect the certain trend for the day, but looking back of them years later, there's just an unmistakable feeling of nostalgia (as well as timeless truth).  even though the music, clothes, slang and the city clearly looks like photos that belong in a time capsule, the attitude, the spirit and the heart remain the same no matter what f--king ear it is. anyone who's really seen the movies, the state of things and has been in company of the people know what i'm talking about.  even some of the of the black characters are a bunny (junglebunny), a big ol' bear and a fox. one of the most sour and unsavory racist characters is a dirty harlem cop who's hot on the trail of these ""dirty n-----s"" after the death of a cop. but for him, it's not just business. nor is it for the rest of the brothers who wear the shield. it's just pure sadistic racist pleasure of hurting blacks.  the sequence involving the godfather and his lady is one of the most moving pieces in the whole film, of which there are many. it plays out like an opera or a ballet.  the promo line: warning: ""this film offends everybody!"" this is not just hype. proceed with extreme caution.  you have been warned...  by dane youssef",1

"stoic and laconic soldier sergeant todd (a fine and credible performance by the ever reliable kurt russell) gets dumped on a desolate remote planet after he's deemed obsolete by ruthless and arrogant colonel mekum (deliciously played to the slimy hilt by jason isaacs), who has todd and his fellow soldiers replaced with a new advanced breed of genetically engineered combatants. todd joins a peaceful ragtag community of self-reliant outcasts and has to defend this community when the new soldiers arrive for a field exercise. director paul w.s. anderson, working from a smart and provocative script by david webb peoples, depicts a chilling vision of a bleak, cold and harsh possible near future while maintaining a snappy pace and a tough, gritty tone throughout. moreover, anderson handles moving moments of humanity well (todd's struggle to get in touch with his previously repressed feelings is genuinely poignant) and stages the stirring action scenes with rip-roaring gusto. russell gives a strong and impressive almost pantomime portrayal of todd; he conveys a lot of emotion without saying much and instead does the majority of his acting through his body movements and facial expressions. bang-up supporting turns by jason scott lee as brutish rival soldier caine 607, connie nielson as the compassionate sandra, sean pertwee as the kindly mace, jared and taylor thorne as mute little boy nathan, gary busey as crusty seasoned veteran captain church, michael chiklis as the jolly johnny pig, and brenda wehle as the sensible mayor hawkins. better still, this film makes a profound and significant statement about the spiritual cost of being a merciless soldier and the importance of intellectual strength over physical might. david tattersall's polished cinematography, joel mcneely's rousing full-bore orchestral score, and the first-rate rate special effects all further enhance the overall sterling quality of this superior science fiction/action hybrid outing.",1
"in the year 2006, ""in cold blood""-a riveting thriller from 1967-has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have. first, and most chillingly, is the fact that it's star, robert blake, was recently on trial for murdering his wife. second, the recent oscar winning biopic, ""capote"" showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tale's author, truman capote. these two new twists make the film timely for a modern audience.  as a stand alone film from it's era, ""in cold blood"" is top notch in every way. most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from conrad hall (later of ""american beauty"" and ""road to perdition"" fame). many of the stills from this film of the kansas farm house at night or the tree-lined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography. combined with the cracker-jack direction from brooks and superb editing in the early scenes (where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers), a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense (even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events). it's also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screen.  the film is also anchored nicely by robert blake's eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo. the flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done. then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last ""confession"" so to speak. it's one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting, superb writing, flawless direction, and haunting photography. i dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rain's reflection from the window flowing down robert blake's pallid face in lieu of actual tears.  the only thing hampering ""in cold blood"" is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end. the tacked-on political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey.",1

(warning: the following maybe a spoiler!!!!) the open ending in cabin by the lake was acceptable, but the open ending on the sequel is ridiculous. i can only foresee return of return to the cabin by the lake being watch able is if the movie was shown up against nothing, but infomercials at 4 o'clock in the morning.",0
the story and the characters were some of the best i've ever seen. the graphics were good for the ps and the cut scenes and voice overs were amazing. i beat the game at least 3 times and loved every second of it. i felt the problems the protagonist faced were believable and realistic and i believe it deserves a sequel. or at least a remake. if they remade it for the ps3 i would buy the system for just that game and maybe mgs4 its amazing also the idea and execution of the dragoon system is enough to warrant a rental and on top of that ad the inventive although sometimes cheating(stupid buster wand) combat addition system and the plot makes this game a definite buy.,1
"wow! stacy peralta has followed up dogtown and z-boys with an equally stunning documentary about the history of the big-wave surfing culture in america. piecing together insider archival footage along with interviews from surfing legends, we are transported into the daring and free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose sheer passion for the sport spawned an industry that today touches the lives of millions.  it's getting to know these icons and their stories that gives the film its warmth. you can feel the respect peralta has for this group as we hear accounts of greg noll striding from a pack of awestruck fellow surfers on the beach to singularly challenge 50-foot swells off hawaii's north coast. or jeff clark, surfing the outrageously dangerous maverick off the northern california coast all alone for 15 years before it was discovered and became the surfing destination in california. and the storybook history of laird hamilton, today's surfing icon. hearing greg noll reverently refer to hamilton as the best surfer ever sent chills up my spine.  (as an aside, noll, clark and others were at the sundance screenings. noll humbly described himself as an old, over-the-hill surfer. he was deeply moved by the audience reception of him and film. both he and clark were as likable in person as they were in the film.)  riding giants pays homage to these extraordinary athletes while at the same time rewarding us with an insight into the magnitude and terrifying power of the waves they seek to conquer, the gut-wrenching vertical drops required to get into them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear that the surfers experience each time they take on a monster swell.  all this, and the movie has more. for those of us that didn't live in california in the 60's, we get an insight into the impact of surfing on american pop culture. (and, to my surprise, the impact of the movie gidget on surfing!) peralta also weaves in a primer on some of the technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. i'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the sundance audience, i was absolutely captivated by this film. peralta is staking his claim as the big kahuna of american documentaries.",1
"this movie is a true masterpiece, it really is. it's rare you come across such a heartwarming flick, full of fun, laughter, heartbreak, and with a little drama to keep you on your toes.   a true family film, homeward bound tells the story of three brave pets, who set out to cross the rocky mountains in an attempt to find their owners, following the changes they go through and the obstacles they encounter along the way. one of the truly stunning things about this movie is its ability to give animals human personalities - the voice acting is that good. shadow is a wonderful character, old, wise and brave, and watching him trying to save sassy in the river was a very powerfully moving moment. chance - who wouldn't love a dog like chance? he's got to be the most mischievous and lovable pup ever shown on the big screen. and sassy is very witty for a cat - she had me in stitches when she was mocking the keeper; 'here kitty kitty kitty... not on your life, chubby.'   there were also lots of well made emotional scenes, such as sassy going over the waterfall (i was truly scared for her), shadow falling in the ditch (almost in tears) and then the fantastic ending, when all three pets return home... including good old shadow!   a favourite for all time - anyone who doesn't like this film must just not like animals. rent it or buy it now, and it'll leave you with happy memories that'll last a lifetime.",1
"fascinating i approached i am curious (yellow) and it's companion piece with great trepidation. i'd read numerous reports on its widely touted controversy and explicit sex. what i got wasn't this, but a thoroughly thought provoking and engaging cinema experience unlike any other. i sincerely believe that the majority of the commenter who felt the film was `lame' or `boring' approached the film as if it were pornography. perhaps this is pornography, assuming pornography is something intended to titillate the senses, but it is intentionally un-erotic. lena, the protagonist, throws her all into her performance giving it a realistic and humanity that is simply convincing and enduring. her breasts may be saggy, her nipples unusually large, her thighs fat, and her face, chubby. but by the end of the film, the audience comes to identify with her, and accept her faults as human. this touch gives her even more believability out necessity. had the director cast a briget bardot bombshell the effect would have been nullified. i cannot more highly recommend this thought provoking piece. be prepared to invest much thought in this deliberately paced film. the patient and unassuming viewer will be thoroughly rewarded in ways most other films could dream.",1
"to all the miserable people who have done everything from complain about the dialogue, the budget, the this and the that....who wants to hear it? if you missed the point of this beyond-beautiful movie, that's your loss. the rest of us who deeply love this movie do not care what you think. i am a thirthysomething guy who has seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one stands in its own entity, in my book. it was not supposed to be a documentary, or a completely factual account of what happened that night. it is the most amazing love story ever attempted. i know that it is the cynical 90's and the millennium has everyone in a tizzy, but come on. someone on this comments board complained that it made too much money! how lame is that? it made bundles of money in every civilized country on the planet, and is the top grossing film in the planet. i will gladly side with the majority this time around. okay, cynics, time to crawl back under your rock, i am done.",1
"the only reason ""the norliss tapes"" deserves any stars is the presence of angie dickinson in the cast. other than getting to see angie baby in a pre-""police woman"" performance, there's nothing else worth seeing here.  the synopsis:  *** minor spoilers ***  david norliss is tapped to write a book on the supernatural. one day he mysteriously disappears after phoning his publisher and suggesting he has stumbled across something that has placed him in mortal danger. the entire series for which this miserable pilot was written was apparently intended to be a series of flashbacks via the ""norliss tapes"" -- a set of audio tapes the writer recorded while investigating cases of the supernatural.  in the pilot episode, a wealthy sculptor dies -- but not before purchasing an ancient egyptian scarab ring from a local occultist who assures him the bauble will give him immortality after death. we soon discover the ring itself doesn't grant immortality. instead, it only reanimates the sculptor's corpse, allowing him to escape his crypt so he can run around town draining pretty girls of all their blood.  blue-faced, yellow-eyed and growling out arrrghhhhhhs you haven't heard since you last watched ""scooby doo"" cartoons, the sculptor attacks his wife (dickinson) one dark night. she escapes and, via a mutual acquaintance, contacts norliss to get his assistance in solving the mystery behind her late husband's uncanny reappearance on her estate.  so is this guy a vampire? no. there's no vampire in this story despite what you may have read or heard. the sculptor doesn't drink his victims' blood -- he collects it. how? don't know. we only see him attacking, never collecting. why? to fulfill the second part of his bid for immortality. it turns out the reanimated sculptor will only be allowed to live forever if he builds a life-size statue of a demon named sargoth out of a mixture of clay and human blood. once it's finished, sargoth plans to inhabit the statue, using it as his gateway into our world.  the final analysis:  ""the norliss tapes"" wasn't picked up as a series for a very good reason... it was garbage. as you can see from my synopsis, the story is a paltry, ill-conceived mess. the acting and dialogue offer no better. this isn't even a contender for a ""so bad it's good"" award. sometimes bad is just bad.  after years of hearing underground rumblings about the great merits of ""the norliss tapes,"" i was very excited to find it airing on fox movie channel on 10/15/03. i wish i hadn't set myself up for the fall.  having screened this groaner for the first time two days ago, i can only assume any applause you've heard so far from other imdb reviewers is coming from those who are reviewing the show based on dim memories and the nostalgia of youth. or perhaps they are simply loyal fans of dan curtis. either way, they've offered you misleading reviews of ""the norliss tapes.""  pauly orchid -- october 17, 2003",0
"and forget this. completely. if you really need to see madonna act, rent ""body of evidence"", at least willem defoe is in that one.  in this film, while the sets are beautiful, you may want to mute the dialog. you won't miss anything. bruce greenwood is wasted, jeanne tripplehorn is a prop, and madonna is so awful, it becomes amusing. why they had to butcher the original film into this mess, i will never know; guess they thought it was ""bankable"". madonna, as an actress, certainly is not.  if you rent the original film from 1979, though, you will enjoy it, and the actors in it can actually act. 1/10.",0
"i really enjoyed the first half hour of this movie but, wow, did it turn corny, or should i say, ""just plain stupid."" this is just another example of outdated humor. it might have been funny in 1940, but not now....not even close.  dick powell is always interesting to watch. i especially liked him once he started switching from his boyish looks and high voice of the busby berkeley musicals to where he's mature and sounds it, too.  he was fine as ""jimmy macdonald,"" but the rest of the cast just played stupid characters, the worst being the boss (raymond walburn) of the maxford house coffee company, who did nothing but shout all the time. he was brutal to hear and was a big detriment to the movie.",0
"i am ashamed to have this movie in my collection. the most redeeming factor to owning the dvd is the short film in the bonus features. my vote for this movie is a big fat zero. don't misunderstand, i'm a horror girl. but i want some meat behind the story, not to mention i prefer the evil to happen to humans, not to be tricked in to watching, what seemed like forever, clips of animal snuff. acts of brutality interrupt achingly long silence and poor acting. if i was forced to make a comparison to another film, the only one that comes to mind is cannibal holocaust. bad, boring, pointless and a wholly uncomfortable watch.",0
"end game started well, the least said about the end the better. it seemed like things we're happening just to keep the plot going, for example the reporter who at first is a very inquisitive, intelligent person, half way through does something really stupid and totally out of character, we are given no reason for this apart from, the next scene wouldn't make sense without it. the whole story could have been told in about 30 minutes, it would have made an average tv political drama the brilliant cuba gooding jr. is very watchable however and james woods does an admirable job considering.  the end game was honestly one of the worst films i've ever seen......and that's saying something, i've seen gigli.",0
"i just saw this film in santa barbara. my friend knew someone who worked on it, so i thought i'd check it out. i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again. the actors were really good and i loved all the music! there was not a lot of talking in the film, which at first felt a little strange- but once i got into it, i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination. i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things, but know that i left the theater thinking about the film. it was shot beautifully and the whole thing was really unique.",1
"why aren't more films (especially american) more like meatball machine?   this is my first official on-line review and i am charged with ""electrical ecstasy"" after having chosen ""meatball machine"" as my first endeavor. this is a review, so i'll try to stick to mere reflection and gut emotion.  i mean, this is one creative piece of work even though it is clearly inspired by the now classic tetsuo! so what if it's not all original? i own both of these films and though tetsuo is one strange son of a bitch, meatball machine is far superior and can be sat through without the strong desire to indulge in a dose of mind altering drugs to clarify film significance. meatball machine is as elaborate in it's story as it is in its high influx of blood and gore. thank you jesus for japanese cinema!  simply put, the last time my dreams were overrun by visions of horror happened after watching nightmare on elm street when i was 7 or so. i could picture in my dreams a tongue coming out of a telephone for weeks on end. this time (at 31) my dreams were pleasantly awe inspiring.  in this film human bodies are host to aliens whose sole purpose is to try and fulfill their never ending quench for human flesh and blood. humans become flesh eating cyborgs!!! there's more!!! fight scenes!! great music!! great point-of-view shots! decent acting by the woman cyborg (at least better than her male counterpart). the fight seen in the end is worth watching ten or twenty times.  oh, and did i forget to mention it's a love story! wow, i hate love stories but this takes the cake!  i can't wait to have friends over to watch this film once more just to see the reaction on their faces. sadly, i took time to write this review because i'm afraid most friends and family wont understand meatball machine. the truth is america as a whole is not prepared for meatball machine.  lastly, my wife walked in while i was watching the climactic fight scene at the end and she was speechless. normally she says something like ""why are you watching that junk?"" this time she had nothing to say. i was glad!   this is not junk. this isn't just splatter (splatter for the sake of splatter is also great). this is art my friends. art.  chacho",1
"really enjoyed this little movie. it's a moving film about struggle, sacrifice and especially the bonds of friendship between different peoples (the child actor who plays miki is especially good). there's so many large scale impersonal films set around ww2, that this convincingly told little story is a real break from the norm, and an original one at that. i'll also add that this film is far from boring, very far!! of course the horses are wonderful and the scenery breathtaking. to anyone who really treats their animal as part of the family (i do), you'll find this film especially rewarding. recommended to movie fans who look for something a little different.",1
"this is just horrible, really horrible trash. yes, we've got beautiful naked women dancing and having sex. but while this may work in the mechanism of a porn movie  may have even been a hit as a porn movie  this tries to mask itself as a ""film"" with actual things to say, with real emotion and struggle. it isn't. it's an excuse to get some girls naked and have a fun time. i'm sure all of these women (and men) in this particular movie could have faired decently in the porn movie business of the 1970s . . . but not in the actual movie business.  the acting was hackneyed, so bad, i mean real terrible. the writing was even worse. i can't lay all blame on these actors  they had nothing to work with. the very broad structure or plot of the movie could possibly be done and done well with good writers and competent actors. the very broad structure or plot is that of a psychotic man who spends his time shooting people from afar, as a sniper. these shootings were motivated from men not respecting their women enough. if there was more writing - better writing, much better writing - and less gratuitous sexual imagery we might have something to work with.  this movie should have been shot, made and marketed a hardcore porn movie all along; it would have made more money. it practically is a hardcore porn film already, and it remains the only non-porn movie i've seen that shows a male erect penis.",0
"while i loved this movie, the trailers that circulated the internet the year before it hit theaters set my expectations a bit high.  i own the dvd, so don't get me wrong, i am not saying don't watch it or even buy it! it's just that i still think the first scene was the best, and nothing throughout the entire movie ever topped it.",1

"i just finished reading a book about dillinger. this movie was horribly inaccurate. it's like they got a list of names and just made everything up. his robberies and getaways were well planned, down to the second - when the time was up, they left whether they had all of the money or not. they had notes of every road, where to turn, etc. purvis never saw him at the restaurant, he was told that dillinger paid for his meal after dillinger left. purvis never even saw dillinger before the night dillinger was killed, only photos of him. the way his gang members died were fictitious. dillinger never robbed a bank by himself, like he did in this movie. if i had never read the book, maybe i could have enjoyed the movie. the acting was a bit over the top in places. the action was overdone as well. on second thought, i doubt if i would have enjoyed it much even if i hadn't read the book.",0
"this series could very well be the best britcom ever, and that is saying a great deal, considering the competitors (fawlty towers, good neighbours, to name just two).  what made butterflies so superior, even to the best of the best, is that it did not just exemplify great, classic, classy and intelligent comedy, but it also expanded horizons, reflecting - flawlessly, gently, and at every detail - the great social change that was occurring in britain at the time.  i remember watching this show as a teenager and being in awe of everything about it. the lifestyle depicted was remarkable in itself. this was the first time i saw real people using cordless phones. and the wardrobe of all the characters was far removed from the goofy seventies attire still seen in north america at the time. then there were the decors, shop fronts, cars. these people - even the layabout sons, with their philosophical approach to life and epigrammatic humor - were sophisticated. they were examples of the ""new europeans"" that would come to have an impact on life and style throughout the world in the coming decade (1980s).  of course, the premise was strange and fantastic. the idea that someone who was living the suburban dream could be so discontent and restless was revolutionary, particularly to north americans for whom happiness was always defined as money and things (sure the situation was depicted in american movies and tv, but not with the intensity of butterflies or the movie montenegro). and, if the premise was not surprising enough, the means by which it was expressed took it to the extreme. a potential affair that was not really about sex, or even romance? butterflies dazzled many, but it must have left some people smacking their foreheads in disbelief... at the time anyway.  butterflies turned out to be - in so many ways - prophetic. it documented, ahead of its time - post-modern ennui, all-pervasive lifestyle, the notion of emotional infidelity, and generational disconnect and male discontent (portrayed perfectly by the strained father-son relationships). it is too bad this series has not been rediscovered in a big way, and all those involved given credit for creating a meaningful snapshot of a certain time and place, and foreseeing all the slickness and angst that was to come.",1
"this, the direct-to-video death rattle of the tremors series, features sixty inspired seconds (sawblade: you'll know it when you see it) and more tedium and filler than you can shake a stick at. tremors 4 was obviously shot on a cripplingly low budget. that means they only had enough special effects mojo for three or four minutes of precious worm-on-human violence, tops. the lackluster, cliche-spouting cast and hackneyed writing ensure that the remaining hour and a half of the tremors 4 experience feels at least fifteen thousand years long. only hardcore tremors fans will be able to sit through, much less enjoy this film. if you aren't among them- don't bother.",0
"i had never read gary paulsen's novel, hatchet, for which 'a cry in the wild' is the adaptation of, so i can't make any comparisons to the book. i will, however, say that as a film on its own, adaptation or no adaptation, it was an underdeveloped adventure that provides no major explanation of its few characters.  think of 'a cry in the wild' as a less luxurious, teenage mountaineer (was quincy, california the only place this was filmed?) version of 'cast away.' jared rushton is 13-year-old brian roebson, a kid headed on a small plane to visit his father, until the craft crashes over some deserted mountain terrain, leaving the kid stranded for quite a while and having to defend himself.  there are basically three parts to the film. the obvious being the ten or fifteen minute introduction of the characters, namely brian and his mom.   the next third of the movie (which really consumes nearly all of the film) is that of brian ""roughing it."" these scenes contain no particularly amazing action, nothing spectacular other than lots of beautiful cinematography of a beautiful yukon landscape. nothing to put you on edge, no real encounters (except a brisk confrontation with a cub), and no major dilemmas to initiate some sort of enjoyment or connection with the character on the screen. you might even feel briefly bored with the passage of time as we witness brian dealing with his situation through first, primitive means, and then more improved ones (using tools, etc) for his survival. it is more like the ordinary time that passes if you were actually stuck in the situation, and that is pretty much about it. in other words, they put no meat on the paulsen's words when they translated them into a visual media.  and, of course, the third part of the movie is his rescue.  there is a subplot that continuously seeks to make itself known during this time, however. some conflict between brian and his parents that created a rocky, awkward relationship between them. however, for the most part, it is only explained in brief, intermittent, minimal dialog flashbacks that look more like a back story for a music video. any minute, the singer from jefferson starship, should chime in an start singing 'sara.' other than what the viewer can draw from the implications, or guess for his own need to fill the gaps in the narrative, we get a very underdeveloped back story which was probably necessary to enjoy at least part of this film and create a connection to the characters, whether or not it really had anything to do with brian's survival adventure in the third part of the movie. these are the flaws in the narrative that through the viewer into a stupor as he struggles to find out what the heck those people there on the screen are doing and, for me, almost done to the point of screaming at the television to say something and tell me more!   it certainly was not, for me, a good adventure tale. but, for fans of jared rushton, it was one of the last few movies he made. so, watch it purely for nostalgia, if nothing else.",0
"i read that this did not well, that the story is not solid, that volckman feels he has failed in some way.  i disagree. first, it is well executed. volckman is doing well to not only to try a new technique, but to have a focus that is worth thinking about: would immortality reduce the value of life? big question ...  i can see he trying hard to build a feeling, and he is not compromising. this is to be applauded. i am sure it was an interesting exercise to build characters in such a form. i have seen artists reduce a form to bare minimum to build the intensity of a moment. i identify this film with this.  further, it is much more interesting than richard linklater's roto-scoping, and volckman's story has more meaning than linklater's later stories of a wasted life on drugs. old news. everyone knows it, but no one does anything about it. renaissance has more to offer, something new to think about. and there are many more stories out there with loads of holes in them that do far better.  well done, volckman. really nice work.",1

"perfect for families with small children who are looking for lighthearted films that contain no violence and are enthralling for the child and amusing, albeit, completely corny, to adults. not a bad film for a low-budget job. children will be amazed with santa's workshop and the ""magic"" that enables him to enter homes through chimneys that appear too small, or homes that have no chimneys at all!  kids will thrill over the santa's success at thwarting the nasty devil named pitch (complete in classic red outfit with horns and tail!). they will sympathize with the poor little girl who's greatest wish is to have a little doll to love. and the poor little rich boy who only wishes to spend time with his forever absent parents. and what child does not know someone at school who are just like the nasty boys that are enlisted by pitch to help capture santa and ruin christmas? in the end, everyone, including the nasty boys, get just what they deserve for christmas!  the film will endear children to both santa and the message of love he delivers to people throughout the world.

"i just watched this movie last night, and i had to put a warning out for anybody else considering to see this film. in a word - don't. i seriously feel like this is something that a screenwriting student would have written in a quentin tarantino/eddie murphy phase, i.e. every other word was a curse word. i don't have a problem with profuse cursing, as in ""good will hunting"", provided it helps to delve more into the characters. in this case it was just hollow banter with the attempt to draw an occassional *gasp* or laughter from the audience. the three lead characters are all their own unique stereotype, the wall street jerk, the coffee house jerk, and the ""i'm-not-gay-just-in-touch-with-my-feminine-side"" slightly-less-of-a-jerk. you just don't give a damn about any of them! they are all shallow, unredemable losers who you want to see lose. for those who dare, this film does have a couple funny moments, the very beginning, and the very end. the toilet/vibrator scene is funny in a sick kinda ""uh, yeah"" way. really though, i would only recommend this film to my worst of enemies.",0
"i am not so much like love sick as i image. finally the film express sexual relationship of alex, kik, sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.ending up was sad.  the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate.  on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. the love proceeding of alex and kiki, and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.  the two main reasons i don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. it doesn't make sense at all. how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. secondly, the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what i was waiting for. however, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. the ""ear piercing "" part was kind of interesting. alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.",0
"you should not take what i am about to say lightly. i've seen many, many films and have reviewed a great deal of them, in print. so when i tell you that this film has the single funniest scene i have ever seen in a movie, you might want to listen to me. there's a lot of diversity of opinion as to what makes this incredibly stupid movie as funny as it is. and to those who just didn't get, well, i can't blame them, too much. the scene i speak of, comes at about the 30 minute mark and involves a dead convict shackled to john candy. up until that point, i had found the film dumb, confusing and it was beginning to lose me. when this scene came up, i laughed so hard, i peed my pants. no movie has ever done that to me before. when the project began, ""going berserk"" was supposed to be the sctv movie. i remember it being announced. as time went on, the cast was whittled down to john candy, joe flaherty & eugene levy. there also must have been a regime change at universal, while it was being shot, because upon being released, it was shown in nearly zero theaters. when watching this a second time, i listened to the theme song (which actually flaunts how incomprehensible the plot is, in the lyrics), relaxed my logic nerve and figured out what was going on. aside from the aforementioned routine, ""going berserk"" has many other hilarious scenes to recommend it. this is almost a 3 stooges flick, except it's much funnier. director david steinberg has razor sharp timing, and he must have been laughing all through this. as for candy, who's basically in charge here, he has never been funnier. with all the plot devices and explanatory scenes thrown out the window, he absolutely runs wild. flaherty and levy follow him effortlessly. there is a plot, but it's a plot like ""animal house"" had a plot, and yeah, the script is uneven, and a little slow to start. once you know this, however, you can well appreciate the full sctv style craziness that transpires. it is stupid, but it's stupid on purpose, and you need to remember that when you see it. do see it, and discover for yourself, if it has the funniest scene of all time in it.",1
"every time this film is on the bbc somebody in the radio times says how it is a satire against the post war world of rationing and the welfare state. i do not think this is the point of the film at all. the film parodies the spivs(small time criminals who ran the blackmarket) and the housewives league who campaigned against government restrictions but were really a tory front organisation.  yes of course the film sends up the political/social situation but in the end the people realise that they need all the controls to ensure a fair society,they want to be british and muddle through rather than foreign.  but i don't think they go back to being exactly like they were before.",1
"ah, true memories. i lived in holland at the time and looked eagerly forward to it every sunday evening and later tuesdays. i saw it during my 14-16s. very good for my (at the time school-)english, as dutch tv provides subtitles for other languages, except for kiddies shows nowadays. so you would hear the original voices and language. - the best series were the first three ones and then after the third series, the great character, nazi von gelb, who was such a formidable enemy, disappeared from the series (i don't think they ever really caught him, he always escaped, leaving room to have him appear again in a next story) because evidently the series also was distributed to germany, and a nazi enemy wouldn't go over very well! too bad, because geoffrey toone did such a wonderful convincing job of portraying the intelligent nazi aristocrat, who had this ongoing obsession to take revenge on england. it was a true delight to see this kind of high quality performance in a youth series, but ronald leigh-hunt was a good counterpart and the youngsters were so normal. they were very believable to me at the time and as a kid i could just imagine to be part of these youngsters, who at the time were about four years older than me. it was a very exciting series to me, standing out in my memory of those times as a special show with ""the prisoner"" as well. i hope they will publish a good quality dvd of the series, that would be wonderful. even the bad copies around are still enjoyable to watch. the later series were not as good, watered down and just not as much fun as the first three. hopefully they also find the other series with von gelb to be put on dvd. greetings from canada.",1
"mercifully, there's no video of this wannabe western that a stay-afloat vehicle for big frank at a time when his career was floundering. the story of a weasel who lives on the reputation of his big gun brother and who gets run out of town by bad guys only to return to rally his townfolks with a new found courage must have been written by a back-room writer. all in all, this show stinks. the story is basically boring, ill-conceived and so naive that it can offend your intelligence. i must depart complete from the other reviewer who found it ""...underrated..."" the critics slammed it at the time and deservedly so. you'll have to catch it on the last show, if you up late and having a bout of insomnia. but, if you can sit through it, you've more fortitude than most of my movie buff friends.",0
"it was a good story, but not very well told. i liked the themes and the main story line, which wasn't as clear as it could have been. maybe there was too much going on and a lack of ability to reign it all in. the acting was okay to cheesy, some were stronger than others and even the stronger actors had their moments of lesser quality acting. it took me a couple of months to get through the entire movie because it didn't keep my attention and the flow was just bad. i only just finished watching it and i'm glad i did as the movie finally gets moving and has some continuity toward the end. again, a good story, but the delivery was sub par. would recommend it for the story line and maybe a little eye candy, and i do mean, a little.",0
"whilst reading through the comments left for this show, i couldn't help but notice that a large percentage of the reviewers had either not actually watched any episodes of the show either all the way through or of their own free will. the thing about kerching! is that it's a children's show, for children so obviously if your older it is going to seem cheesy, forced, and probably stupid. i even found one person saying the sets were stupid, but i remember as an eight year old wondering why taj had ikea icecube moulds on his wall, and also wondering if my parents would let me stick some on mine (they didn't). yeah, it can be annoying, the acting could be better and some of the characters do really weird things with their hair, but as a kids show, i rate it 10/10. compared to the stuff they air in its place today, well, lets just say i wish it'd be re-aired. dvd release, anyone?",1
"i went to see fever pitch with my mom, and i can say that we both loved it. it wasn't the typical romantic comedy where someone is pining for the other, and blah blah blah... you weren't waiting for the climatic first kiss or for them to finally get together. it was more real, because you saw them through the relationship, rather than the whole movie be about them getting together. people could actually relate to the film, because it didn't seem like extraordinary circumstances, or impossible situations. it was really funny, and i think it was jimmy fallon's best performance. all in all... i would definitely recommend it!",1
"perhaps i missed the meeting when the meaning of ""b-movie"" was explained, but what i just saw was ridiculous. you want a good synopsis of this movie? take aliens, replace the xenomorphs with vampires, then remove everything that was good about it, and that's pretty much it.  5 minutes into the movie, the ""v-san squad"" (that's the dumbest acronym i've ever heard) checks out a ""base"" thats been massacred by vampires and then they climb down (down? what?) a ladder obviously attached to a billboard with an obvious present day train in the background. when is this supposed to take place? 2210. okay...(hold on, i'll get back to that)  yeah. the characters. wow, well there's the token lesbian asian chick, the redneck cowboy wannabe, the weathered captain, the goth vampire/hot topic part-time cashier, and the wussy noob second in command. all of them are played by their respective actors with the same lack of ambition. it almost pained me to see micheal ironside in this flick. isn't he getting enough money being the voice of sam fisher in splinter cell? pretty much the only thing original about vampire wars is about how bad it is.  watching this afterbirth of a film, the only amusement i got was from the feeble attempts at set-making. since when does taping pci computer cards on a wall count as a ready room on a starship? the money required to do this film could have been put to much more better use.",0
"i love this movie, but can't get what is in this movie tht is not to like. people who don't like this movie must be richard roeper and roger ebert. but i can't believe that is mr. carrey behind all that makeup. and i am sure that most of the actors and actresses in the movie has made film before this. and there is a new face in the movie. taylor momsen who plays cindy lou who. as the opens, the grinch (jim carrey) comes out of hiding. and causes some mean fun to the whos in whoville. sicne we know that the whos love christmas. while the grinch does not like christmas. and even makes fun of little cindy lou who (taylor momsen) who is the daughter of the town's postmaster (bill irwin). the movie was directed by ron howard. and the narrtor's voice is done by anthony hopkins. and jeffrey tambor (muppets from space) is cast as the mayor of whoville. who doesn't like talking about the grinch close to christmas time.",1
"the first (and only) time i saw ""shades"" was during a sneakpreview. it hadn't even been in premiere. i remember there was someone of the directors staff there, don't even remember who. it was a belgian movie, we never heard of it, so we were quite neutral, not knowing what to expect. mickey rourke is a brilliant actor and he's stands miles ahead all the rest. he plays an actor who's star has long stopped rising. he's helping to realise a movie in belgium entitled ""shades"".  as soon as the movie started, we noticed how much swearing there is. nothing against the occasional swear word. however this was way beyond annoying. whenever rourke uses the f*** word to express something, it comes naturally. however, when someone from the cast, a non-english speaker uses the f**** or s*** word, it becomes arrogant and aggressive.  we quickly lost count of how many times they used the f and s words. everybody was just glad to be out of the theatre. and we had to give a vote, but it was hard for us because it was only from 0 to 10, and we were looking for the -10.",0
"this movie was such a blast! it has that feel-good, yet totally in your face attitude that draws me to a movie. it has a good message (party girl decides she needs a real job) yet she doesn't completely lose all sense of fun. i recommend this movie for anyone who needs some humor, but is also a thinker! :)",1
"if you want to see a movie that terribly mixes up one latin country with any other latin country, ""the celestine prophecy"" is a good example: 1. perú, not even in its most violent times, has not shown polices or soldiers as much as in this film. this showed a country like el salvador when civil war. since i'm a peruvian who lives in lima (the capital of perú), it was too funny to me seeing the police guards here, there and everywhere. 2. if you have a car in perú, and you want (or need) to be a taxi driver, just post a sticker with the word ""taxi"" on the front glass of your car and you can drive freely in peruvian streets (there are taxi companies, but their rates are quite expensive). no need of yellow or a black/white squared band on the doors of your car. well, taxis in this film have that band, somethin that you will never see in perú. 3. peruvian people are not caribbean styled clothing. for example, when a taxi driver comes out, he was wearing a ""guayabera"" (cuban shirt), a white hat, and 40's mustaches, like clark gable. not one peruvian man looks like that, please! perú is not the caribbeans! 4. a scene shows a woman on a street with a quite long skirt, like the typical folklore dresses in latin america. take a walk anywhere in perú, and you'll never find a woman wearing like that, unless you are watching a typical dance. 5. cast could've been better: i can not deny héctor elizondo is a great actor, but he's not a latin actor (his father was basque and his mother from puerto rico, but he was born in new york) and his spanish is not fluent. it's notorious spanish is not his first language. there are dozens of very good latin actors who could've performed as cardinal sebastián. petrus antonius (general rodríguez) was also a bad choice for a ""latin police officer"". it was so funny seeing elizondo and petronius in general rodríguez's office. they looked like two english or american students in a spanish class, making their best effort in order to pronounce spanish. unsuccessfully, of course. castulo guerra was better in his spanish. a ""peruvian"" officer, who announced cardinal sebastián, spoke a quite funny spanish too. there are very good peruvian actors, like augusto alvarez-calderón and christian meier (just to mention two out of many peruvian actors), who could've performed with excellence. 6. i admit that a fictional movie can let itself a license inventing cities or, even, countries. but, please, when creating a name, be careful when using a foreign language: the town portrayed in this movie should've been called ""vicente"" and not ""viciente"". vicente is a male name, and viciente has never been used. 7. i disagree one user, who says that this movie was filmed on locations in perú. not one location is peruvian, although the production has used in excess posters showing ""inca kola"", the peruvian soda. as not few american films, this one must have used any latin country. after all, for american producers or directors, a latin place is identical to any other latin place. 8. in the first scenes, when john (matthew settle) flies to perú, he's supposed to arrive to the only one international airport in perú: jorge chávez airport (in lima, the capital). actually, believe me, it must be any airport in the world, but peruvian airport. and, of course, in peruvian airports there are no military or police guards. 9. when this john takes a room in a peruvian hotel, this one has a fan and, obviously has no air conditioner. please, this doesn't happen in no hotel in perú(and other latin countries), unless you get a 1 star hotel! 10. the rebels who fight against the government are... ¡colombians! their accent was, with no doubt, from colombia. for casting them, the producers should've hired peruvian actors. in few words, it would've been cheaper filming in perú.  i could go on with more examples out of this film, that led me to give it a ""1"" (awful) vote, but i fell asleep after about 20 minutes from its beginning. but dear producers: it's not a tragedy: there are many worse movies with not few mistakes. just let's remember ""indiana jones and the kingdom of the crystal skull"" and indescribable disney's ""the emperor's new groove"". the list of bad films could be endless...",0
"i thought the film was good in parts.the start was exciting .the first 30 minutes of the film were good.the camera angles in the first 30 minutes were strange and i did not like it coz the were they not covering the actors entirely.  i think the last 25 minutes of the film were really not that great from which we expect a lot in case of such films.  the dialoques did not make sense and i don't think they were very witty.  i felt as if they were trying to copy films like phonebooth in terms of dialogues,but failed miserably.it seemed as if they many of the scenes between the actors were put for sake of it and did not make any sense to the story.  the entire film features only law and caine.  i don't think it was a waste of time,its an ok film,but not gr8",0
"titanic has to be one of my all-time favorite movies. it has its problems (what movies don't) but still, it's enjoyable.  when i stumble across someone who asks me why i like titanic, i suppose my first reaction is ""wait a minute, you don't?"" i know so many people who don't like this movie, and i'm not saying i don't see why. ""the love story is too cheesy"" well, yes but isn't it enjoyable and moving? all right, the love story between jack and rose is very unrealistic, everyone knows that love like this doesn't actually exist. but this is a movie, doesn't everyone enjoy watching a beautiful story that lets us slip slightly into fantasy for a while? the next complaint, dicaprio and winslet are terrible actors. well, ok, in this movie, i agree that they do not perform to their full potentials. however i think it's unfair to say that they are terrible actors. i personally think they are both very talented actors who unfortunately are very famous for a movie that they are not amazing in. but the roles they are given are simple, and the characters seem real enough that you can care about them quite a bit, but i agree with many people that they did not do as well as could have been expected.  and finally, if one is going to complain that they don't like this movie because they hate romance, or because they hate history, or tragic movies, then i'm sorry but why on earth did they go and see a movie that is so clearly all of these things. it's like people who complain the dark knight is a bad movie because they hate action movies. simply for being a movie, not because you dislike the genre, this is a good movie.  well deserving of its oscars, in particular, best cinematography, which i find to be the best i've ever seen in a movie save maybe the lord of the rings trilogy.  i know some of the writing fails, such as the constant screaming of each other's names throughout the movie. the flashback portion of the story can be quite weak at times, but overall it's an amazing achievement in making the titanic look so real, and the sinking feel so epic.  i understand why a lot of people dislike this movie, but for the most part it boils down to them disliking the fundamental idea, such as it being a love story, rather than them thinking the movie in and of itself is poorly constructed.  i can tell you that i have read more than five books about the titanic, including memoirs form the day it happened, and this movie is extremely historically accurate save just a few faults. the only main ones i can find is that the piping should be threaded copper, not steel, and the iceberg looks fairly unrealistic as is the scene where they hit it.  i give this movie 10/10, not because i like romance movies, but simply because it's an outstanding cinematic achievement, that leaves one feeling horrified by the realistic adaptation of events.",1
"this 1977 cult movie has two crazed lesbians (sandra locke & colleen camp) appearing at the home of wealthy socialite doctor george manning (seymour cassel), in hope of help in locating a residence they can't seem to find. but these two have other plans in mind, when they find out george's wife is out of town, they end up taking control of the residence, tying up the george, killing a delivery boy while destroying the place all in one evening. bizarre and disturbing movie, but the two get there just reward in the same bizarre way as the movie ends. most will either dislike it right off or get caught up in this ludicrous movie after about 30 minutes into it. either way some even consider this a cult classic.  larry dodson",0
"all day now i've been watching dinosaurs, and all day they've had the same fundamental problem.  they don't believe in firearms. they just don't seem to have been _told_ about them or something. bullets _bounce_ off of dinosaurs! maybe it's because they became extinct millions of years before the invention of gunpowder, and the laws of physics were just different back then... aah, no. come on. if they're close enough to chemically operate today, they'd have to be vulnerable to fast (even subsonic) lead projectiles. it's that simple.  look, the toughest-skinned reptiles on the planet today, alligators and crocodiles, are completely vulnerable to basic rifle fire. they're nothing magic. you can shoot a pistol round right through the heavy scales on their backs. they don't take armor-piercing bullets or anything special. small bullets penetrate them, they just don't kill them. somewhat (but not really) large bullets are preferred because the challenge (as with most game) is to kill the animal with one shot, so it doesn't run. (hunters consider it immoral to allow prey to run off and die unharvested.)  most animals, including predators, are easily repelled by gunfire. between the noise, and the pain of even a non-lethal wound, most will run away. an exception are big bears, which are so fearless that they're merely enraged by mortal wounds. cape buffalo are regarded as highly dangerous because they are well known to charge when wounded. we've seen video of the big bulls of a herd of cape buffalo rescuing a calf from an entire pride of lions. a big cat will run if it can, but if it can't it will charge as a final act of desperation. where a t.rex would fit in this spectrum is unknown. their behavior simply has not been observed. with these larger animals, safe hunting becomes a matter of applying an appropriately large and powerful projectile, and/or applying several of them rapidly enough to counter its charge. with a t.rex, of course, this could be a serious problem. i've seen a t.rex skull (they have one in the museum downtown) and carrying a gun big enough to bust that might be impractical. chewing its neck off with lots of smaller fire might be a more viable approach. small bullets would still _penetrate_ them, they wouldn't just bounce off just because the animal is too big to easily kill!   so here we have cortez and his men (this is _before_ the famous mexican campaign, apparently) captured by american natives and scheduled for sacrifice on the pyramid. it appears that all those human sacrifices were about appeasing the bloodthirst of the pair of t.rexes that terrorized the continent in the day. rather than just having their hearts cut out and being fed to the lizards, cortez et al talk the aztecs into letting them hunt & kill them. ok, maybe they don't have m-16s like the guys in the ""carnosaur"" series, but they _do_ have flintlocks, crossbows, pointed sticks (big ones, made from trees) and swords. maybe that's a little less uneven than squads of soldiers with full auto, but they've several guys and i'd quickly bet on them over a dinosaur. oh, wait, there's a _cannon_, about a 4-incher. that's just the ticket for busting a tyrannosaurus' skull! so they lay a trap, with a squad of men, cannon, pointed sticks in a ravine, and lure the first t.rex into it, using a pretty brown girl as bait. cortez points out that they'll not have time to reload, so they'll have to close the range until they can be certain of their aim. t.rex totally ignores their volley of flintlock fire, and we see both a crossbow bolt _and_ the cannon ball _bounce_ off! forget it. end of credibility. a crossbow bolt would defeat cortez' torso armor, and a 4"" cannon ball might penetrate the hull of a wooden ship! this would also _certainly_ get through the hide, ribcage, or skull of any animal ever to walk this planet. (do you think a _whale_ could withstand a 4"" cannon ball?) and here's t.rex, still standing, not even bleeding. so cortez lures it to the ravine, where it falls onto the pointed sticks, which (i guess by magic) penetrate it and kill it. yaaay, pointed sticks!   the dinos aren't completely invulnerable to gunfire - they manage to put out an eye of the second one with a pistol. this runs it off, so it's not as mean as a bear or a buffalo, at least in the movies.  they kill the second dinosaur with a bomb - made from a gourd filled with gunpowder and gemstones. my money would still be on the cannon. it's engineered function is to concentrate all the gunpowder's energy in one direction - toward the target. a bomb is a much more diffused application of force. a _real_ bomb (not a gourd bomb) has a steel casing which contains the explosion to extremely high pressure. (think: pipe bomb vs firecracker.) a pile of gunpowder set on fire will simply go poof. (trust me on that one.)",0
"**1/2 for this diane keaton farce.  someone should tell ms. keaton, enough with your annie hall philosophy and hats.  this flick is just too much as keaton's daughter, sara, dies in a traffic accident, while her boyfriend survives.  keaton, who could not be reached by phone at first, as she was in the sack with her pal and had pulled out the phone plug, grieves in a new way for grievers.  she retreats to the summer locale where all of sara's friends are staying. she cleans the house, sleeps for two days and then begins to reveal things which were better not to be revealed. it appears that sweet sara slept with her girlfriend and the guy who ultimately married the latter. in addition, she had an abortion thanks to this guy. we're all now put on this guilt trip.  her only hope is to find the elusive diary that sara kept. she also hopes that boyfriend,adam, who is a playwright, will not include all this in another play.  when the diary is found, it has been written in japanese. sara had a ph.d in this language. it's not that great news for mom when an excerpt of the diary is translated by a japanese cook in a japanese restaurant.  naturally, everything seems to tie up nicely in the end.   the title of this shmaltz comes from the wizard of oz. every time mom and sara would speak, they would both utter surrender dorothy.  as if this isn't enough, during the course of this bizarre extravaganza of mourning, keaton tells adam not to be another woody allen in his film, interiors, where he tried to successfully emulate ingmar bergman. ms. keaton also tries drugs with the group. come on, folks, can we realistically believe that anyone in his right mind could mourn like this?   fair to mediocre best sums up this film.",0
i must say this movie is truly amazing and heartwarming. reese witherspoon is so charming and jason london's not so bad either! it is so sweet watching dani fall in love and it breaks my heart and yet warms my heart at the same time watching court fall in love with maureen. however it is even sweeter watching how much he cares for dani. i must admit though i did kind of want him to fall for dani in the end. it is just so cute watching her fall for him i did not want her to get her heart broken so badly. but the biggest tragedy i have ever seen occurred in this movie. watching him die made me cry for a whole day. i just could not believe it. however never a more loving relationship has been shown in a movie then maureen and dani. they really can make it through anything. i am giving this movie a 9 because i didn't want court to die but it was still one of the most amazing movies i have ever seen.,1
"okay, the story makes no sense, the characters lack any dimensionally, the best dialogue is ad-libs about the low quality of movie, the cinematography is dismal, and only editing saves a bit of the muddle, but sam"" peckinpah directed the film. somehow, his direction is not enough. for those who appreciate peckinpah and his great work, this movie is a disappointment. even a great cast cannot redeem the time the viewer wastes with this minimal effort.  the proper response to the movie is the contempt that the director san peckinpah, james caan, robert duvall, burt young, bo hopkins, arthur hill, and even gig young bring to their work. watch the great peckinpah films. skip this mess.",0

"what a surprising treat to come across on late television. had i only read a brief plot rundown on a television listing before seeing the movie, i would have passed. the idea of a movie about a hit-man-seeing-a shrink-wanting-to leave-the-business-and-falling-in-love....sounds trite. but the film works. from the start of the movie, it's clear the man carries a weight on his shoulders, before he even says a word. the look and feel of the film is perfect. dark, but not obnoxiously so.  aside from the hit-man family aspect which provides a touch of surrealism, macy's character grapples with his marriage, and his father's control. macy shows a repressed sadness, and his bedtime talks with his young son are amazing. the young boy shows acting skills well beyond his years, and the interaction between the father and son is so very natural, personal and loving.  this is one of the best movies i've seen in a while, and i can't believe i came across it by accident on late night television.",1
"""they all laughed"" is one of those little movies i am always recommending to friends seeking something out of the ordinary. it is firmly rooted in the screwball romance traditions of the past, but seems more contemporary. even the decidedly early 80s atmosphere doesn't date it too much. bogdanovich wisely keeps the whole enterprise so light on its feet, that reality never brings it crashing down to earth. but, that said, this sort of sweet little movie absolutely relies on the actors to keep it going, and ""tal"" is blessed with a dream cast who understand the requirements of this sort of tale. it is a movie that wouldn't linger so long in the memory if it weren't for the little moments provided by the excellent cast: colleen camp's simultaneously shouting orders at john ritter and her dog; blaine novak unleashing all that hair from under his hat; and especially the moment dorothy stratten falls for john ritter and says, ""how...weird."" it's such a piece of fluff one doesn't want to lay too much on it for fear of crushing it, but it is certainly does leave one with a light heart and a smile on one's face.",1
"being a film studies graduate i would like to think that i have seen a diverse range of films, some good and some bad, but i would have to say that 'summer rain' is by far the worse film i have ever seen! i chose the film in the hope that it was going to be a great british classic such as 'secrets and lies' or 'lockstock' but oh no this was so bad that my flat mates and i ended up laughing and cringing at the ridiculous acting and cheesy script (reminded me of a bad 'theatre in education' school production). the main characters michelle and gary began to annoy us from the start. 'michelle' the main character who lives with her two friends has the type of face that you would never get tired of slapping and gary was so wet (he kept breaking down in tears every 5 minutes) that by the end of the film i really didn't give a damn about either of them. all i could think was ' i paid £3 for this pile'. i have never written a review before but after watching this film it has spurred me on to warn people of this disastrous production. so please avoid at all costs. thanks for reading.",0
"assuming this won't end up a straight-to-video release, i would have to say void this title at all costs. unless you're bored of good, well-executed movies, that is. i saw this last night at afi dallas, and i left with 20 minutes remaining, simply because i didn't care anymore (about the plot, not about insulting the director...that is awkward). when you can spot a goof only 5 minutes into the movie (a shot out, shattered window before any shots are fired...and then the window breaks with the first shot), things are going to bad. let's just say this is only an indicator of things to come...unfortunately.  i'll spare you all the details, but this is sub-par in every manner, even the half-assed acting by michael madsen is disappointing when you're expecting half-assed acting from him. and the rape scene...christ!

"'say yes' is one of those flicks that you keep hoping is going to get better, but it never does. it's the kind of 'motiveless psychopath decides to menace an innocent couple' crapfest, so beloved of straight to video film-makers.   the dialogue is clunky and, in several places, poorly translated. the acting is uniformly poor, especially from the villain of the piece, played by joong-hoon park. he seems to think that by not blinking and trying to talk in a deep voice he is making his character seem threatening, when all it really does is make him seem a bit simple.  the plot deserves special mention, as it is idiotic beyond all belief. the 'heroes' don't think it overly strange that their hitchhiker threatens to kill them. the 'heroine' twice manages to miss seeing the villain when he is no more than a foot away from her. the villain gets past a police checkpoint (while wearing a shirt covered in blood, and a bloody head bandage) by showing the cops a burnt corpse in the passenger seat of the car he is driving. the villain is punched, clubbed with a shovel and stuck through with a pitchfork, but never seems to be impeded by these, rather serious, injuries. and don't even get me started on that terrible 'twist' ending. sheesh.  the only plus point in this film, for me, is sang mi chu. who is very pretty, but really no more than a mediocre actress.  overall, this film comes off like a poorly written, flaccidly acted and shockingly directed attempt to copy 'the hitcher' and 'spoorloos', but it fails at every turn due to a lack of talent in everyone involved.",0
"the fifth ""black emanuelle"" i've watched has, potentially, the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery/prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown, new york! the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which, inexplicably, play completely different roles, namely ivan rassimov (appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries!), karin shubert (as a feminist rival reporter) and don powell (as rassimov's chauffeur).  unfortunately, as usual with this type of film (despite their being shown in the dead of night), it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene (described in ""stracultr) in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here!! still, a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls (including, naturally, gemser and shubert) into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums (this is the way he gets their votes, get it!) - with his high society pals giddily looking on - seems pretty much intact.  the most ridiculous element of this entry - apart from gemser's penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house (even in front of perfect strangers) - is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan/guru (george eastman made up to look considerably christ-like!) who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely; of course, when emanuelle calls him up on it, he ends up having premature ejaculation...!!",0
"a truly frightening film. feels as if it were made in the early '90s by a straight person who wanted to show that gays are good, normal, mainstream-aspiring people. retrograde to the point of being offensive, ltr suggests that monogamy and marriage are the preferred path to salvation for sad, lonely, sex-crazed gays. wow! who knew? the supporting characters are caricatures of gay stereotypes (the effeminate buffoon, the bitter, lonely queen, the fag hag, etc.) and the main characters are milquetoast, middle-class, middlebrow clones, of little interest.  as far as the romantic & ideological struggles of the main couple are concerned, there's not much to say: we've seen it all before, and done much better.",0
"maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun  check! isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen  check! tasty looking love interest  check! assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy european accents  check! german sounding bad guy played by an english actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion  check! corny one liners  check!  deary me, does this film take the wee wee or what? the clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script is!  in a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video rip off of die hard only set on a mountain (complete with some nicked lines from the aforesaid) we have all the usual action move cliché's ticked off progressively as we go along with some good old fashioned violence and nudity thrown in to wake up anyone in the audience who may just have nodded off.  jack wild is the cop in full on john mcclane mode here who even manages time for the ye ancient bad guy with gun has used all his bullets gag at one point.  in amidst this mess, there are a few well known recognisable faces who i can only assume needed the cash and/or were simply playing it for laughs right from the pointless opening scene that had nothing to do with the plot whatsoever through to the final implausible conclusion complete with ropey dialogue and even ropier effects.  looking up this three quid from the supermarket bargain bin effort on imdb i am astonished to find that this dud spawned not one but two sequels, i have got to find these gems on dvd! it looks like the first sequel is a rip off of under siege 2 and the second sequel, well goodness knows! one thing that is always a bad sign is that the actor playing jack changes with each film and even the character's name seems to change for the third instalment.  still, blind purchases of cheap dvd's just would not be the same if studios didn't keep trotting out material of this awful quality!!",0
"one of the best of the fred astaire and giner rogers films. great music by irving berlin. solid support from randolph scott, harriet nelson, lucille ball, betty grable, frank jenks, and astrid allwyn.  terrific songs include ""let yourself go,"" ""let's face the music,"" and ""putting all my eggs in one basket."" the last song is introduced by astaire playing a jazzy piano and then a cute dance with rogers. rogers also sings ""let yourself go"" with grable among the backup singers.  harriet nelson (then hilliard) sings two nice songs and plays rogers' mousy sister. ""get thee behind me"" is a song that sticks with you for days. she also sings ""but where are you?"" snappy and fast paced, this entry in the astaire-rogers series is one of the better ones. the classic and amazing beautiful finale, ""let's face the music and dance"" is among the best-known of their numbers. rogers wears one of the great dresses in movie history.... a shimmering sequined number that swirls around her legs as she dances (weighted hem) and is also slightly see through. just gorgeous. this is the number that steve martin and bernadette peters re-created in pennies from heaven.  randolph scott seems an odd choice as astaire's pal but he also appeared in their roberta with irene dunne. luckily he does not attempt to sing or dance. it seems that grable and ball would have had bigger parts in 1936 but they have a few scenes and make little impact. allwyn has the bigger role but is only ok.  rogers has one of her best solo numbers in the series with ""let yourself go"".... jazzy and thumping, it's a great song.  fun all the way, although i got tired of ""we joined the navy"" after the third time....",1
"don't believe all of the negative reviews this movie receives. yes, it is cheaply made. yes, the gore is laughable. and, yes, the acting is sub-par. however, this is a textbook example of an early slasher flick, and if that is your ""thing"" (its mine!) then you will enjoy this one. there are enough good aspects to this movie to more than compensate for the drawbacks. for one, the score by a then unknown christopher young is very creepy and accents the violence perfectly. the ending is a welcomed break from the predictable upbeat endings of most movies. and last, but not least, the setting is what made the film for me. the makers of this film could have done a much better job ""dressing"" the set to make it more believable as a college dorm. however, if you can overlook this flaw, the setting is great. four collegiates all alone in a huge, abandoned, condemned building just waiting to be torn down.... it reaks of possibility. when watching, allow your imagination to do some of the work and you may enjoy this film as much as i did.",1
"this has to be the worst piece of garbage i've seen in a while.  heath ledger is a heartthrob? he looked deformed. i wish i'd known that he and naomi watts are an item in real life because i spent 2 of the longest hours of my life wondering what she saw in him.   orlando bloom is a heartthrob? with the scraggly beard and deer-in-the-headlights look about him, i can't say i agree.  rachel griffiths was her usual fabulous self, but geoffrey rush looked as if he couldn't wait to get off the set.   i'm supposed to feel sorry for bankrobbers and murderers? this is a far cry from butch cassidy, which actually was an entertaining film. this was trite, cliche-ridden and boring. we only stayed because we were convinced it would get better. it didn't.  the last 10-15 minutes or so were unintentionally hilarious. heath and his gang are holed up in a frontier hotel, and women and children are dying because of their presence. that's not funny. but it was funny when they walked out of the hotel with the armor on, because all we could think of was the black knight from monty python and the holy grail. i kept waiting for them to say ""i'll bite yer leg off!"" we were howling with laughter, as were several other warped members of the audience. when we left, pretty much everyone was talking about what a waste of time this film was.  i may not have paid cash to see this disaster (sneak preview), but it certainly wasn't free. it cost me 2 hours of my life that i will never get back.",0
"this was the first sequel i'd seen (apart from return of jafar) and i honestly thought before watching it that it would be close to the original. i was horribly disappointed.  the storyline was, basically, the first script with a few extra characters and the situation turned around. ariel and eric have a daughter, melody who isn't satisfied with life on land. she wants to become a mermaid. however, ariel has kept her past from her daughter because she wants to protect her-and when melody finds out she's upset and angry. and she then decides to run away, and she becomes a mermaid. so she's happy swimming around, and ariel sets out to find her-as a mermaid.  the story doesn't sound too bad written down, but the clichés and repeats of situations from the first movie are just too obvious. and adding the fact that melody is, overall, extremely annoying, and the movie becomes almost unbearable.  there's also a whole load of other new characters-tip and dash being two of them. they aren't too bad as characters in themselves-just try not to think of timon or pumbaa! the songs leave a lot to be desired too, they just don't have the same magical energy as the songs from the original did. the animation obviously didn't have a whole load of work put into it either-in parts it's jumpy, and not much imagination is used for the characters movements.  another piece of advice-try to forget about ariel's original character while watching this movie. the beautiful, rebellious, curious teenager has 'all grown up' into a bland, boring wife and mother, and her trademark red hair is all tied up. this is much better viewed if you've never seen the original-you'll have nothing to compare it to.  however, all in all, it could have been worse-it's not as bad as certain other sequels, such as cinderella ii. but it's not in the same league as the original. but it for your collection if nothing else but if disney go on like this they'll lose all their older fans.",0
"the finnish version of robert altman's ""short cuts"", set in the small rural town of äänekoski. the episodes present a kaleidoscope of the eternal events, problems and emotions of human life: joy and love, deception and disillusionment, hopelessness and death. i was particularly impressed by two episodes. the first is the story of the young waitress, who tries to stir up a romance for his co-workers: she radiates an overwhelming joy of love and life. the other episode presents and old man dying in a hospital and his wife trying to help him die with dignity. particularly striking is the way the old couple have to fight their way against the humiliating practices of the hospital and their loneliness contrasted with the ""routines"" of the hospital crew (despite the signs of occasional empathy). compared with altman's classic, this movie is perhaps less professional, but it is definitely a great piece of art.",1
"i occasionally see some of this show because my wife watches it sometimes. i try to enjoy it for it's basic idea which is helping a needy family, but several factors get in the way for me. every episode follows the same format where many parts seem totally scripted (which they are) and tears flow seemingly on cue. the attempt to manipulate the viewer with a mixture of emotional breakdowns and sad music is a real turn off for me. the fact that everyone who donates something to the house, be it sears or whoever, has to plug themselves for being generous is also annoying. probably the biggest problem i have with it all is that what must be huge amounts of money and a small army of workers are combined to build an amazingly over the top home for a single family. now i know that this amount of money is nothing but a drop in the bucket for disney/abc but how much more could be done for more people with the amount they are putting on one house? instead of focusing on one family and getting them all to cry during the episode why not help 10 families and show highlights? isn't life difficult enough for the average person? why do i need help finding things to feel sad about, why not show something truly inspiring without being manipulative? i know what is being done for these families is good, but they are also being used for ratings. you can't tell me they aren't being coached sometimes on the crying. i guess when i see these people moving into a home that most hard working people in the u.s. could not afford for their children it really bothers me. i can't help but think of what could really be done with a small portion of disney's money. instead of giving each member of the family a flat screen tv and or personal shower that tells you the water temperature and shoots out of the ceiling why not help more people afford food, clothes, education and medical insurance? i know so we can be entertained and have a good cry. in terms of money, i feel the same about oprah. i don't think anyone can actually conceive the amount of money she possesses. yes her recent reality show did good things, but when she gave $30,000 to each losing ""contestant"" i'm sitting here thinking...that's a years salary for many, many people...if they're lucky. don't get me started on game shows. so i realize that extreme makeover home edition is ""doing good"", but forgive me if i see it as more self serving than giving of itself. is there anyone out there that feels similar?",0
"how tasty was my little frenchman tells a story that is alternately sad, scary and life-affirming. it ends with a brutal finale that you knew had to happen, even though you were hoping--maybe even beleiving--it wouldn't.  utlimately, this is the film's greatest strength: it expertly plays with your emotions and expectations, then drops a bomb on you.  i saw this in a film theory class at usc back in the mid-'90s. it is not easy to find, but is definitely worth hunting for.",1
this is how movies are supposed to be made: a fascinating setting; characters about whom you come to care deeply; writing and editing that move the plot efficiently and build suspense. this is a wonderful film -- deeply moving without being sentimental. highly recommended.,1
"the form of the film is that of a suspense shocker. there are surprises, twists and turns, reverses and excitements. at times, this is truly an ""edge-of-the-seat"" film. but it disappoints, and disappoints severely.  the villain of the piece is not believeable; his character does not hold together. i refuse to ""spoil"" the film, but will only say that the character we meet at the beginning just could not be he whom we see at the end.  the second major disappointment of the film is that--finally, it becomes little more that a bloody slasher film. there is little qualitative difference between this and one of the ""friday the 13th"" films. not that every film need always be totally tasteful, but this film does drip gore on occasion.  though the film features the magnificent sean connery, even he does not measure up to his usual standard, and often just seems to be walking through the paces.",0
"chilling, majestic piece of cinematic fright, this film combines all the great elements of an intellectual thriller, with the grand vision of a director who has the instinctual capacity to pace a moody horror flick within the realm of his filmmaking genius that includes an eye for the original shot, an ice-cold soundtrack and an overall sense of dehumanization. this movie cuts through all the typical horror movies like a red-poker through a human eye, as it allows the viewer to not only feel the violence and psychosis of its protagonist, but appreciate the seed from which the derangement stems. one of the scariest things for people to face is the unknown and this film presents its plotting with just that thought in mind. the setting is perfect, in a desolate winter hideaway. the quietness of the moment is a character in itself, as the fermenting aggressor in jack torrance's mind wallows in this idle time, and breeds the devil's new playground. i always felt like the presence of evil was dormant in all of our minds, with only the circumstances of the moment, and the reasons given therein, needed to wake its violent ass and pounce over its unsuspecting victims. this film is a perfect example of this very thought.  and it is within this film's subtle touches of the canvas, the clackity-clacks of the young boy's big wheel riding along the empty hallways of the hotel, the labyrinthian garden representing the mind's fine line between sane and insane, kubrick's purposely transfixed editing inconsistencies, continuity errors and set mis-arrangements, that we discover a world guided by the righteous and tangible, but coaxed away by the powerful and unknown. i have never read the book upon which the film is based, but without that as a comparison point, i am proud to say that this is one of the most terrifying films that i have ever seen. i thought that the runtime of the film could've been cut by a little bit, but then again, i am not one of the most acclaimed directors in the history of film, so maybe i should keep my two-cent criticisms over a superb film, to myself. all in all, this movie captures your attention with its grand form and vision, ropes you in with some terror and eccentric direction, and ties you down and stabs you in the heart with its cold-eyed view of the man's mind gone overboard, creepy atmosphere and the loss of humanity.  rating: 9/10",1
"this movie was kind of interesting...i had to watch it for a college class about india, however the synopsis tells you this movie is about one thing when it doesn't really contain much cold, hard information on those details. it is not really true to the synopsis until the very end where they sloppily try to tie all the elements together. the gore factor is superb, however. even right at the very beginning, you want to look away because the gore is pretty intense. only watch this movie if you want to see some cool gore, because the plot is thin and will make you sad that you wasted time listening to it. i've seen rumors on other websites about this movie being based on true events, however you can not find any information about it online...so basically this movie was a waste of time to watch.",0
"""ruby in paradise"" is a beautiful, coming-of-age story about a young woman, ruby lee gissing, escaping her stifling roots to become herself. although the title character is played artfully by the gorgeous ashley judd -- in likely her first movie role, albeit one to be quite proud of -- the emphasis is not upon becoming ""somebody,"" a la the next madonna (whether jesus' mother or the lurid, attention-hungry singer).  it instead emphasizes following ones' instincts and being somewhat introspective about them, to grow into one's ideal, adult self. note: this isn't an action movie!!! it uses an occasional voice-over narration (by ms. judd) while writing in her journal -- and oh, i see i've just lost the male half of the readers out there. but be patient with this beautiful movie, where we learn that one's bliss can be discovered in -- oh, i dunno, carrying water and chopping wood.  actor/director/writer todd field, who played nick nightingale in ""eyes wide shut,"" co-stars as ruby lee's noble love interest, one who helps her heal her idea of relationships implanted from youth.  but not even his character is the answer for ruby lee: there's no external hero imposed upon her. the ultimate message is that we are responsible for ourselves. writer/director victor nunez, who also wrote/directed ""ulee's gold,"" did an amazing job showing a young woman growing into herself -- confronting age-old challenges of good v. evil along the way.  the supporting cast is also stellar, and the music used, particularly the cuts by chanteuse sam phillips (whom i hear is the wife of t. bone burnett), is right on -- most especially ""trying to hold on to the earth."" now, when i hear the first few chords of that song, tears spring to my eyes, pavlovian and unbidden -- not sure if it's the music, or the indelible connection to the movie's quiet, charming message of empowerment.  this movie is highly recommended for any young person trying to find his/her way. for any woman of any age, it is a must see! the downside: it is not on dvd, except in spanish. (we learned, however, that it is legal to make one copy of a vhs version, which can be readily found online. my beloved husband found someone with a vhs copy and got a dvd copy made for me.) although this treasure of a movie occasionally pops up on-air  on an indie channel, usually  you can't count on that when you might need it most as a tonic to soothe the pressures of the world. so buy a copy for yourself.  this movie should have a major re-release, and it would, if i were queen of hollywood.  -- figgy jones",1
"this is probably the fastest-paced and most action-packed of the german edgar wallace ""krimi"" series, a cross between the dr. mabuse films of yore and 60's pop thrillers like batman and the man from uncle. it reintroduces the outrageous villain from an earlier film who dons a stylish monk's habit and breaks the necks of victims with the curl of a deadly whip. set at a posh girls' school filled with lecherous middle-aged professors, and with the cops fondling their hot-to-trot secretaries at every opportunity, it certainly is a throwback to those wonderfully politically-incorrect times. there's a definite link to a later wallace-based film, the excellent giallo ""whatever happened to solange?"", which also concerns female students being corrupted by (and corrupting?) their elders. quite appropriate to the monk theme, the master-mind villain uses booby-trapped bibles here to deal some of the death blows, and also maintains a reptile-replete dungeon to amuse his captive audiences.   alfred vohrer was always the most playful and visually flamboyant of the series directors, and here the lurid colour cinematography is the real star of the show. the monk appears in a raving scarlet cowl and robe, tastefully setting off the lustrous white whip, while appearing against purplish-night backgrounds. there's also a voyeur-friendly turquoise swimming pool which looks great both as a glowing milieu for the nubile students and as a shadowy backdrop for one of the murder scenes. the trademark ""kicker"" of hiding the ""ende"" card somewhere in the set of the last scene is also quite memorable here. and there's a fine brassy and twangy score for retro-music fans.  fans of the series will definitely miss the flippant eddie arent character in these later films. instead, the chief inspector sir john takes on the role of buffoon, convinced that he has mastered criminal psychology after taking a few night courses. unfortunately, klaus kinski had also gone on to bigger and better things. the krimis had lost some of their offbeat subversive charm by this point, and now worked on a much more blatant pop-culture level, which will make this one quite accessible to uninitiated viewers.",1
"i think that, deep down in the darkest, slimiest part of their heart, everyone likes jerry springer just a little bit. while his show is undeniably offensive and stupid, it also gives us a chance to see that, relatively speaking, most of us have it real good. when you look at the trailer park livin', dollar whiskey drinkin', incest lovin' people on the springer show, it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park. jerry is performing a public service, and we should be grateful. he ditched a political career to host the show, just for us.  what we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie ""ringmaster"". ""ringmaster"" shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show, or so they would like us to think. the movie follows the pre-requisite springer story line: love triangles. one triangle involves connie, her daughter angel, and her husband rusty. the other involves starletta, vonda, and demond. when the two hapless groups meet up in la, their lives intertwine and collide head-on, all culminating in an explosive episode of the springer show. it's like what ""short cuts"" would be if robert altman had had a severe crack habit.  ""ringmaster"" is true to the show, as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish. it also makes me very glad that i don't live in the squalor it's characters do. but the movie has a problem. it's billed as a comedy, but it just isn't very funny. what laughs there are to be had are few and far between. maybe some people watch this and laugh non-stop. if you think blow jobs and rape are funny, well then i guess you're one of those folks. personally, i laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of white-trash life.  the jerry springer show just isn't meant to make the leap from tv to the silver screen. what's funny in an hour long show (less, when you count commercials) isn't necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie. movies have to tell a story, and that's something else ""ringmaster"" has trouble with. the story is threadbare. there are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder. and even if there weren't such problems, how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story? even the hollywood formula couldn't make this better. ""ringmaster: is so bad, it even screws up the best part of the springer show: the final thought. somehow, even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built around.  the worst offender in all of this is springer himself. he's such a bad actor that he can't even play himself convincingly. watching springer play springer is sad. it's like he was going for a 'what if woody allen played jerry springer' vibe, and he failed. miserably. he went to the trouble of producing this disaster, the least he could do is try to make it just that much better.  not that i'm saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance. just the opposite. they all suck. not so surprisingly, no one in this movie went on to greatness. the best any of them was did was molly hagan landing a job on a nickelodeon sitcom. apparently, nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the '90's to star in a children's program. it makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pasts.  here are my final thoughts: what we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn, who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience. should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely brain-damaged lumps of goo? i say no. somewhere out there, in this crazy, mixed up world, there is a perfect movie for each of us. we just have to keep looking for it. until next time, take care of yourselves and your loved ones. and don't ever watch ""ringmaster"".",0

"the script for this columbo film seemed to be pulled right out of a sappy 1980's soap opera. deeply character-driven films are great, but only if the characters are compelling. and in this film the only thing compelling was my desire to change the channel. the villain's dialog sounds as if it were written by a romance novelist. the great lt. columbo himself is no where near his famous, lovable, self-effacing, crumpled self; and the bride/kidnap victim is a whimpering, one-dimensional damsel-in-distress (she cowers in fear from a tiny scalpel held flimsily in the hand of her abductor - come on!!! i could have knocked the scalpel out of his hand and kicked him in the you-know-what in 2 seconds). in any sense of reality, this character would have at least tried to struggle or fight back at least a little. and speaking of reality....the story revolves around a kidnapping which is worked and solved by the police. the police?? give me a break. everyone knows the fbi takes over every kidnapping case. this was no columbo, just a shallow and totally predictable crime drama with our familiar lt. columbo written in and stretched to 2 hours.",0
"coinciding with the start of the baby boom, the years after world war ii saw an unprecedented exodus of americans moving out of their city apartments into the suburbs where they can fulfill their dreams of owning their own homes. directed by h.c. potter and co-written by norman panama and melvin frank (""white christmas""), this lightweight but surprisingly observant 1948 screwball comedy captures the feeling of that period very well. of course, it helps to have a trio of expert farceurs  cary grant, myrna loy and an especially acerbic melvyn douglas  head the proceedings with their natural likability at odds with the escalating frustrations of home ownership. even though the film is sixty years old now, there is a timeless quality to the blandings' dream and the barriers they face in achieving it. obviously, hollywood thinks so since it's been remade at least twice - first as a very physical tom hanks comedy, 1986's ""the money pit"", and again last year with ice cube's ""are we done yet?"". one look at hgtv's programming schedule will show you how the situations explored here still resonate today.  the plot begins with ad man jim blandings, his wife muriel and their two daughters cramped into a two bedroom-one bath manhattan apartment. rather than pursue muriel's idea to renovate the apartment for $7,000, jim sees a photo of a connecticut house in a magazine and realizes this is where they need to move. with the help of an opportunistic real estate agent and against the advice of their attorney and family friend bill cole, the blandings decide to buy a ramshackle house badly in need of repair. however, the foundation sags so badly that the house needs to be torn down in favor of a new one. this sparks the blandings to push the architect to design a house so excessive that the second floor is twice as big as the first. costs rise with each new complication, tempers flare, and even a romantic triangle is imagined among, jim, muriel and bill. priorities finally sort themselves out but not before some funny slapstick scenes and clever dialogue that tweaks the not-so-blissful ignorance of the new homeowners.  with his double takes and flawless line delivery, grant is infallible in this type of farce, and jim blandings epitomizes his more domesticated mid-career characters. in a role originally meant for irene dunne, myrna loy shows why she was hollywood's perfect wife. she doesn't get many of the funnier lines, but she combines her special blend of flightiness and sauciness to make muriel an appealing character on her own. watch her deftly maneuver the overly agreeable house painter with her absurdly idiosyncratic color palette. as avuncular, pipe-smoking bill (""colebill cole""), melvyn douglas shows his natural, easy-going élan as grant's foil. smaller roles are filled expertly with particularly memorable turns by harry shannon as the laconic well-digger mr. tesander, lurene tuttle as jim's officious assistant mary, and louise beavers as the blandings' lovable maid gussie. the 2004 dvd provides some intriguing vintage material including two radio versions of the movie - the first a 1949 version that did end up pairing grant and dunne and then a second 1950 version coupling grant with his then-wife, actress betsy drake. a most appropriate 1949 cartoon, ""the house of tomorrow"", is also included giving us a comical tour of a futuristic dream house. the original theatrical trailers for ten of grant's film classics complete the extras.",1
"i bought dark angel seasons 1 & 2 two weeks ago, after catching a couple of season 1 episodes on channel 5. nothing prepared me for how brilliant the show is. i haven't enjoyed anything as much since firefly (also and amazing show). i'll admit season 2 wqasn't quite as good, but there are still some amazing episodes (see designate this, bag 'em, the berrisford agenda, harbor lights, freak nation etc.) and alec is great. i've heard some of the plans for the would-be season 3, and i have to say, i can't believe it was cancelled - i won't spoil it for you - but it would have rocked! i also think it has a lot of potential as a movie (although at the moment it seems highly unlikely). as proof of my obsessiveness, max's barcode number is 332960073452, and in the two weeks i've had it, i am 3 episodes away from having watched both seasons twice. it's just too good.",1
"this has to be one of the 5 worst movies ever made. the plot looked intriguing like that of passenger 57. but with the latter movie it somehow worked a lot better. the plot has been worked out in the worst possible way. just a few of the awful moments in the movie, a flight attendant is standing in the opened doorway of a flying 747 and trying to close the door without being sucked out by the 250 mile per hour winds?!? thereafter the lands the aircraft from a few miles out starting at 8000 feet, thats impossible even for 747 pilots with thousands of hour experience. when on the runway (perfectly straight of course) she is instructed to pull on the flaps, huh!! come on flaps are there to ensure lift at low speeds, when on the runway you use thrust reverse on the engines and give maximum power! i can go on and on about little and mostly big mistakes in the movie, but then my reply would become the size of the english dictionary. this is a movie you want to miss, take my word for it!",0
"well the previews looked funny and i usually don't go to movies on opening night especially with my kids because ......well you never know. here is a movie that doesn't appeal either to children or adults as the jokes are too perverse for children and falls completely flat for entertainment purposes for adults. i was actually embarrassed to be with my 9 and 6 year old and having to explain to my 6 year old what s h * t spells. essentially what happens here is a total twisting of dr. seuss's classic. it adds an evil and lazy neighbor who wants to marry the children's mother for her money. if that was a subplot, then maybe that would have been fine but it ends up being the major plot around the whole movie and ""the cat"" plays more of a subplot role in exposing the neighbor to the mom for who he really is. take my advice and read the book and pass on the movie.",0
"well, let me start off by saying how utterly hilarious this film is, i simply couldn't keep myself from laughing at the sheer stupidity of it. don't get me wrong, it is well acted particularly by bassinger but the script is just, well the mind boggles truly.  the premise is good and up until della actually witnesses the murder it is engaging but after that it just goes downhill . half way through the film the protagonist pulls out her toolbox and of course instead of lobbing it at the guy's head, she decides to pull out a screwdriver, car jack and finally a flare (as in for a sinking ship) respectively to kill her victims.  then there is the final line that i promise, if it doesn't have you in stitches then i will eat my own left foot.  i would recommend this film to those who simply want to laugh at some good old fashioned, appalling film making. might i also suggest you watch out for the scene in the scrap yard with the guy falling from the one foot high plank of wood, gets me every time.",0
"the genre of suspense films really takes a dive in this one. the big problem is implausability. i realize that you need to create difficult situations which would cause suspense and the tense feeling of whats going to happen next, but this movie was so predictable, and is just not believable. i find that the more i watch this kind of movie, the more i am continually saying things to actors to direct them away from danger. continually making bad decisions just borders on being plain stupid. if they took the time to make it more realistic, i might have enjoyed it a little. having said that, you might be better off staying away from this one.",0
"i simply cant understand why all these relics from the ceausescu era refuse to let go. one can see clearly how frustrated they were during the commie censorship that forbade them so many things to show in their movies, and now they imagine its dunno what big deal of artsy-fartsy freedom so fill the screen with people defecating, urinating, vomiting, swearing, and any other kinds of hideousness imaginable. this is not cinema, friends and neighbors! this is simply visual perversion. forget about bunuels chien andalou, about david lynch, about forman and neorealism and other movie makers who were able to work with an aesthetics of ugliness. those people were mastering their jobs - well, you don't! do us a favor, all you daneliucs and nicolaescus and saizescus and muresans and marinescus and margineanus and other obsolete old-timers, and leave us alone! its bit time to see some romanian movies on screen, enough with your immature terribilisms! you are not directors, you are illiterate!!!",0
"this movie had so much potential. anyone who followed the story of jeffrey knows that there are so many details overlooked in this movie it's ridiculous. too much time and effort was spent in the movie on dahmer's homosexual tendencies and his alcohol consumption. where was the character development? the origins of any villain are always interesting and dahmer was no exception. where in the movie does it address his adolescence when he began killing and mutilating small animals? instead we are giving a dizzying array of flashbacks that seek to explain the origin of the killer, but fail to address the major point in dahmer's development. also, the reason why the country became so intrigued with this story was the details - how he stored the bodies in his apartment and the lengths and measures he went to to accomplish this; his cannibalism and his desire for flesh, etc. i could go on, but to sum up, too many lagging points in the film, focused on his sexuality and not enough of the gore - the good stuff you would expect to see when the title of the movie is ""dahmer.""",0
"this movie has made me upset! when i think of cat in the hat. im thinking of cat in the hat books. you know, the one from a few years back that parents read to thier children. well, i though that this movie would be a lot like that! but much to my suprise was nothing like the books! insted it is more like young adult humor movie. in one part cat is talking to a gardening tool (hoe) cat talks to it like it is his hoe (agin adult humor). the naming of his car i all so though was a little untastful for a kids movie. under the rating you'll find: mild cude humor and some double-entendres. i think in short this means adult humor. i wish i could return this movie! wal-mart said they wouldn't because the movie has been opened. if you are thinking about buying this i suggest that maybe rent before you buy.",0
"well, i'd be lying if i said that this could easily rival spiderman or the batman movies. still, it was more appealing to me for it's moral value. i first bought the vhs when my son was about 2 years old and it immediately became his favorite. my wife and i are avid supporters of robert townsend and have been since he used credit cards to finance his first movie, ""hollywood shuffle"". true, he needs to take advantage of the talents and knowledge of technical advisors to make the films more believable, but his movies are still fun.  meteor man provides a hero with an urban contemporary feel. i always felt that, if there were superheroes, they wouldn't provide the same scenarios as depicted in the comics. meteor man is realistic hero with real problems: car broken into, bad neighborhood, local drug-dealing gangs using children for distribution, etc. the scope of his mission stayed pretty much within the community.  what i found to be truly entertaining, outside of james earl jones' ""young forever"" performance, was how the neighborhood responded to his newly discovered powers. it wasn't long before they had a full agenda lined up for him, without his input, of course. it was hilarious to hear them offer to lend him out to other communities where their extended families lived.  yes, the plot was weak, the movie was predictable, there was bad acting and continuity was rotten, but it ranks #1 with my kids. robert townsend works to bring movies ""home"" so to speak. i doubt he'll ever truly be recognized as the talented actor/producer/director he truly is, but there are and will always be, those that love him for his efforts.  one point to ponder about the film, which i find amusing: throughout the entire battle with simon, no one bothered to call the police???? also, what mother and father do you know that will watch their son fight from a window? my mother would have been right there, scrapping by my side, toe-to-toe. dad would be loading his pistol. lol  rent it and check it out. it's worth seeing at least once and good for those of you that are fans of sinbad, luther vandross, bill cosby, big daddy kane, etc. great job with the cameos robert!",0
"being the prototype of the classical errol flynn adventure movie and having a good story as well as two more brilliant co-stars in maureen o'hara (what an exquisite beauty!) and anthony quinn, i can only recommend this movie to all those having even the slightest liking for romance and adventure.  hollywood at its best!",1
"i know this sounds odd coming from someone born almost 15 years after the show stopped airing, but i love this show. i don't know why, but i enjoy watching it. i love adam the best. the only disappointing thing is that the only place i found to buy the seasons on dvd was in germany, and that was only the first two seasons. that is disappointing, but that's ok. i'll keep looking online. if anyone has any tips on where to buy the second through 14th seasons, please email me at darkangel_1627@yahoo.com. i already own the first one. the only down side is that the dvds being from germany, they only play on my portable dvd player and my computer. oh well. i still own it!",1
"every once in a while i will rent an action/adventure film just as a way to relax and occupy my mind with nothing important. this is why i own a copy of charlie's angels (2000) - not a quality film, but it makes me laugh and allows me to unwind for a while. one of these days i will probably buy copies of the princess bride and a few monty python movies for much the same reason.  in any case, i rented this film because i wanted to be entertained without being challenged. for the most part, i got what i wanted. the plot was something along the lines of a poorly written xena episode, and the kathy long's acting was very community theater (not bad for a professional kick boxer and amateur actress). there were a few high points on the part of the cyborgs. somehow they managed to get some pretty good actors to play the bad guys - unfortunately, most of them die pretty darned quick.  like most martial arts films, the further you get into the movie, the more emphasis there is on action, and the plot (which wasn't strong to begin with) deteriorates almost as quickly as the acting. however, the more kathy long fights, the more time the director devotes to her backside. by the end of the movie i was seriously considering watching it a second time just to count the number of times kathy long's tight red shorts were center screen.  unfortunately, there just wasn't enough meat to this film to make satisfying curiosity worth seeing the film a second time. if you are a hard core xena fan in need of something to wile away a few hours - by all means, go to the grocery store and spend the .50 cents on the rental. there are some strong similarities between the show and this movie.  just don't expect anything more than to be mildly amused for a few hours.  unless, of course, you happen to like kathy long's derrière. then you might want to purchase a copy.",0
"perhaps more than many films, this one is not for everyone. for some folks the idea of slowing down, reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. for others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists, some part they long for contact with.  i suppose it's a function of where i am in my own life these days, but i count myself in the camp of the latter group. i found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic, gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological. this is indeed a journey story, a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if we are to come full circle at the end of our days.  much as been written of mr farnsworth's presentation of alvin straight, though i'm not sure there are words to express the exquisite balance of bemused sadness and wise innocence he conjured for us. knowing now that he was indeed coming to terms with his own mortality as he sat on that tractor seat makes me wish i had had the opportunity to spend time with him before his departure. i hope he had a small glimmer of the satisfaction and truth he had brought to so many people, not just for ""acting"" but for sharing his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty.  given the realities of production economics, i'm not sure full credit has been given mr lynch for the courage he showed in allowing the story to develop so slowly. an outsider to film production, i nonetheless understand there are few areas of modern life where the expression ""time is money"" is so accurately descriptive. going deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and to his credit mr lynch seems to have understood that he was not simply telling a story--he was inviting his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. no simple task, that.  if you'd like to experience the power of film to take introduce you to some precious part of yourself, you could do worse than spending a couple of hours with the straight story. and then giving yourself some time for the next little while simply listening to its echoes in the small hours of the night.",1
"actually i'm surprised there were so many comments about this movie. i saw it as part of a slavic film festival at a major american university. but nobody in usa has heard of it, which is a real shame! the dynamics between the people are what makes it both funny and sad. they are stuck together on a long bus trip--someplace most of us have been!! but i never had one like this!!   my favorite scene is the one where they stop for the funeral. then the man & woman sneak off for some lovemaking in the forest but everybody follows them to watch without them knowing! just as she raises her skirt and he enters her all the way--the consumptive starts hacking & they realize everybody is watching!! talk about surprised! but...you really have to feel for them even if it is hilariously funny! when you see the ending it is sort of ironic that they enjoyed themselves while they did! serb humor at it's best!",1
"i watched this movie in the wee hours of the morning when i should have been asleep. this, in itself, was testimony that deliverance was a spell-binding movie. i think boorman did a wonderful job on directing this film. how expertly the early scene with the hill folk and the dueling banjos was done. it showed so well and early on how inherently reserved and simple the people of the area were. case in point - near the end of the ""duel"", the banjo-playing boy was smiling (loved his banjo), but when drew tried to shake the boy's hand after the ""duel"", the kid was too reserved to respond. the river trip never left you bored, for sure. the rape scene was brutal, but necessary to show just what the group was up against in this backwoods area of georgia. i think beatty's traumatic shock afterward was well done. some have said he was pretty unaffected by the ordeal. i disagree - if you really payed attention, he was unresponsive during the entire action immediately following, in which reynolds put the arrow through the attacker and they chased off the toothless guy. it was confusing when ed killed the other guy later, at the top of the cliff. it almost appeared that the arrow was shot while ed was curled up and expecting to die, but then you realize the arrow he had shot earlier had finally taken effect.  anyway, a great movie, and i was wavering between an 8 and 9 on my vote, but after reading a message from a disgruntled voter who gave it a ""1"", i gave it a ""10"". this individual's reasoning seemed based on personal bias, rather than an objective viewpoint, and his vote was obviously a non-correlating attempt to lower the rating.",1
"there's nothing new for me to say: 4 hours of people dying over and over in the same hill. the cast was stellar, but unfortunately the producer/director/editor/god goofed. he should have eaten humble pie (if not for his own sake then for the men who died in kargil), hired one of these brilliant bollywood directors, hired a real scriptwriter, hired a real editor, hired a musician that wasn't related to him in some way (and who seemed to have listened to some bad version of ""apocalypse now"" on some cheap indian drug), hired a real professional crew, thrown away all the fireworks and told a real story. unfortunately he, like the bigwigs of the indian army, made decisions that were terrible for his actors, and terrible for his audience. we all died over and over.   please don't do that again, sir! sushma kathmandu, nepal  ps: next time an indian director decides to glorify the gurkha regiment, i suggest he hire more than one nepali to represent the team. surely there are plenty of nepali men working in bombay--last count was 40,000 to half a million.",0
"this movie was so terrible it was almost good... almost. we love musicals, but not this one. even with the terrible sound quality, poor cinematography, and many actors who can't sing or dance, anthony rapp actually managed to give a good performance (especially toward the end). the character marjorie, a drunk lady, was enjoyable to watch, too.   the plot is very unexpected and could have been funny without terrible singing and cheezy piano music. admittadly, some of the songs (fantabulous) are pretty catchy (but not in a good way).  open house is a funny movie to watch simply because it is awful! we think it might be a good stage musical (with excellent actors).",0
"it's got christopher lee, it's got huge banks of 1970s computers that make teletype noises as letters appear on the screen, it's got radioactive isotopes that not only glow in the dark but emit pulsing thrumming noises, it's got volcanoes! evil aliens disguised as nuns! tidal waves! earthquakes! exploding cars! exploding coffee machines! and as a climax the entire planet blows up. how on earth does this film managed to be so incredibly, mind-numbingly dull? the answer, my friend is because 90% of this movie is made up of establishing shots, most of them involving long tracks, pans, or zooms in combinations, or occasionally all three, that do nothing except give the crew something to do. there are endless shots of our protagonists driving, getting in and out of cars, driving again, walking around looking at stuff, getting in cars and driving... i just sat there watching endless parade of nothingness in stupefaction muttering ""say something, please somebody, just say something... do something... anything!...""  the dialogue, when it does come, is terrible.  ""maybe their minutes are measured on a different scale than ours."" was a typically meaningless line. the script culminates in the destruction of the world by stock footage, justified in this speech from lee as the head alien:  ""the planet earth has emitted an over-abundance of diseases, they are contaminating the universe. all the planets light years away from here will suffer unless it is destroyed!""   this is is neanderthal sf script writing. this is the sort of motivation you find in the sort of 1950's japanese monster suit movies aimed at 7 year olds. it is, and i collect such things, the most god-awful line from an english language sf movie since buster crabbe retired. it beggars belief that this movie was released in the same year as star wars and close encounters.  lee, who always struck me as a smart, useful actor with a sure knowledge of his limits, delivers his lines as if he is going to kill his agent for getting him into this pile of drek. i don't blame him.",0
"it is first and foremost a chick flick, it is a romantic comedy. there is a fair balance between the two. this particular movie has the addition of some pretty sweet fight scenes, i don't think any wires were used or if they were they weren't flat out blatant. it isn't a terribly complicated movie so it easy on the brain, no need to analyze anything to get the deeper meaning, pretty simple, good chemistry between the leads, and a fun watch. i'd like it if they made brought out the full potential of the girls looks just once cause she can be amazingly cute, but throughout the movie they keep it low key kind of pretty. i'd watch it again...with a girl.",1

"this series was cbs networks answer to the success of the big valley. it was a 90 minute western just like the abc program was. while it was an answer, it did not have the stuff to make it past season 2.  the problem really became reality got lost on this show. for example- in one episode, johnny gets his eye poked out by a stick. amazingly, by the end of the show, johnny had healed entirely. along with that, the stories on this were no where near as strong as the big valley.  this is a show that i would not want dvds of, & frankly hope they are never released. think since cbs was running out of lots, they re-used many familiar settings. this was one the last western series cbs produced as westerns were not real popular in the 1970's.",0
"anyone witness to our justice system - or lack thereof will find this film truly satisfying. there weren't too many shades of gray with regard to characters or plot. virtually every character in this film epitomized what is best and worst about our society. the popularity of this film is probably due to the fact that most of us at one time or another have had to deal with scumbags along with the namby-pamby, lily-livered, melee-mouthed bureaucrats that empower them in the name of ""political correctness"".   the performances across the board were compelling. i sympathized with the rape victim - while at the same, found it gratifying to see her wipe the smug, vicious arrogance off the faces of her former attackers. in particular, i found the dyke one of the ugliest characters in all of the films i've seen, so it was nice to see her former victim shut her mouth for good. the lead rapist and psychopath was equally ugly, so it was only fitting that dirty harry himself offed him in a loud grotesque fashion in the end. this was the only sequel in the dirty harry saga that equaled the first.",1
"zombie bloodbath is a movie made by zombie fans for zombie fans with a true love of the horror genre. as i understand it from the commentary and things i have read, it was made during the huge midwest flood of 1993 when half of missouri was underwater. buildings were under water. cars and houses were underwater. one article said that zombies and the crew from this movie would help sandbag the river after shooting each day. the fact this movie got made at all is a miracle. it is like a huge mashing of every zombie movie ever made put through a troma filter. it is a party movie to enjoy with friends who like loads of splatter and goofy characters. and it is fast paced and energetic and really funny.  a toxic spill accident in a nuclear power facility causes people to melt down or turn into zombies. the local government covers it up, tears down the factory and builds houses over it. some ground shifting (?) causes a cave opening to develop and some new residents find the cave and unleash the undead on the newly built community. from there it just gets crazy and gory and fun.  i have read these reviews on here a few times. and it seems obvious to me that the same person attacked this fun little movie three times as a different reviewer, using fake names. they use the same words and sentences. zombie bloodbath is cheap. it is raw. it has some bad acting. so does half the movies made. there is much much worse out there than this fun movie. if you hate this film so much, don't buy it. there is no need for personal attacks and to call the crew or cast ""trailer trash."" and it is obvious you are not from australia or england. it is just upsetting that this great service, the imdb does not catch people using it just to trash others. there are bad reviews and good reviews, and i don't mind those. i give both bad and good reviews myself. but it is painfully obvious that some fool just wants to use this forum to personally attack the director of this movie. sad.  some of these so called ""reviewers"" even basically sue their ""review"" just to promote their own movies. one called this film boring - well, love it or hate it, one thing you can never say about this film is that it is boring. it moves fast and never has a dull spot.  oh and this reviewer from the netherlands??? um - liar. you tried to post this same review at amazon and it got yanked there. the same review only it said it was from missouri.  this nonsense has to stop. love it or hate it - give it a real review or type nothing. it is obvious you have not seen the films.  but for the record, i have and though this one is not nearly the best that i have seen, it is far from the worst. and even the worst i would give an actual revoew and would not attack the director personally.  hope this review helps some people see through the stupidity going on here.",1
"i was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute. it is brilliantly shot, with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed. the plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike. she hires an assistant at work, with her true intention being to find love. he's an ex-con and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her. in return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off. the film transcends into a dark film noir, with a couple of truly excellent scenes, and an even better finale. the real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading character's disability. the use of sound keeps the tension consistent, and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping, that's for sure. throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression you've got the makings of a great film. it's the sort of film hollywood really wants to make, but just can't.",1
"my husband and i were intrigued by the spectacle - a strong willed southern lady with a messy personal life solves crimes for the lapd. the first season was must-see tv for us. unfortunately, the stories of her personal life in the second season became so tedious and unworthy of the strong character that we stopped watching.  my husband and i were troubled by the episode where she tries to hide from her mother the fact that she is shacked up. but the deal breaker was the episode where she hides her possible pregnancy from her boyfriend but tells her boss. why would a strong, middle aged woman do those things? the answer is she wouldn't. additionally, my husband and i pick out the bad guy with almost perfect accuracy. it is almost always a white male or female introduced in cameo at the murder scene or in an idealized family. can't the script writers do something original from time to time? as i mentioned, we are no longer viewers. we prefer shows that don't betray the characters and insult our intelligence.",0
"watching film i was in very light mood and also this film is light but the end of the film is just unexpected which leaves a long lasting memories in one's mind.  movie starts with abhay and his profession of being witness during registrar marriage. soha comes for marriage and his boyfriend doesn't, leaving soha alone on to the street she cant go back home and she don't have any thing to live on here in this situation abahy turns out to be a helper for her, this is the base of story.  the rest is just watchable and the end of the story is bitter sweet that abhay has to face which keeps you at the edge of the seat.  dialogues and music are good songs are ok direction is good and so as the screenplay you do feel that movie is slow but looking to the demand of story it is all right.  a truly watchable especially with light mood i enjoyed this at home with coke and peanuts. my rating for this is 8/10",1
"i have seen this movie at the cinema many years ago, and one thing surprised me so negatively that i could not see any redeeming virtues in the movies: dennis quaid was cast as a policeman that never smiles or grin, while his smile and grin are two of his trademarks. danny glover was cast as the bad guy, but - again - most viewers' imagination could not go far enough as to believe him in that role. also, jared leto was not believable as the former medicine student. the tension was just not there, since the killer was known very early. the finale was, again, neither dramatic nor tense: nobody around me cared about what was going to happen next. all we could wait for was the end of the movie. all in all, a disappointing evening spent at the cinema.",0
"priyadarshan- whenever a person heard his name, his first thought would be 'comedy'. that is what this man is known for, or rather, was known for. after giving stupendous blockbuster comedies like hungama, hera pheri and hunchul, his train derailed slowly with movies like chupke chupke and a few others whose names i can't recollect for now. now with hideous films like dhol, the first word that would strike our mind after hearing his name would be- 'torture'.  dhol is a mixture of bad, unfunny toilet jokes, somewhat of drama, poor suspense and idiocracy. the only good thing about dhol was one or two of the scenes which were funny, though not witty, and secondly, except for kunal khemu and the hysterical grandma, the acting was decent.   speaking of the acting, i felt that rajpal yadav and sharman joshi were at the top (if you compare them with the others in the movie), then came tusshar kapoor, then tanushree and at the last the two idiots mentioned above. the flaw in kunal khemu was that he was loud in his jokes and even in his acting. the grandma, firstly resembled a ghost, plus she was not funny at all but rather silly.  the plot was the same, seen before one. four boys behind girls and in need of money, but with a few twists. there is a 'bad' man who is preposterously stupid and dumb. and at last, the good wins over the bad and everything is fine. the idea of having a dhol with a tone full of cash in it is simply not witty.  the worst thing about the movie is its length. after an hour or so, you get exhausted and want to leave the theater. but being a critic, it is my responsibility to tolerated the whole two and half hours of the movie. the movie goes on and on and the same kind of jokes are repeated again and again and the situations are perennial just at a different place.  if your mother-in-law has arrived to your house and starts mocking you at everything, then send her for this movie and have fun. 3 out of 10.",0
"i just loved watching it though and having fun with it's total badness of a film. i saw this film through the helpful sarcasm of mystery science theater 3000 and i have the dvd. if you flip the to the other side of the dvd, they show the actual movie, so i gave it a chance. seriously, folks this is grilled cheese.  the acting, special effects, and plot in general is very cheesy and unrealistic. ""doesn't she need lungs"" said crow noticing how the head can still talk while it doesn't have a body, and tom servo just wistfully remarks ""no, she's got neck juice!"". the ending is just classic and no one can touch this soundtrack with k-porn! i loved the ""cat fight"" between the two strippers. that ""meow"" after the fight or scene, whatever, was classic. so, in some ways this was a fun movie. i think for horror fans, you'll probably enjoy it. for a good time, watch the mstk3 version, you'll get a great laugh.  mst3k version: 10/10 the brain that would die: 1/10",0

"i should admit first i am a huge fan of the dandy warhols, and that is the reason i came watching this film.  the uniqueness of this film, compared to other modern rockumentaries, is that it's not just about one page of a band's history (like ""i am trying to break your heart"", about wilco), but rather covers long period of the band's history. in this movie, director/producer ondi timoner closely followed friends/rivals the brian jonestown massacre (bjm) and the dandy warhols (dw) for more than 8 years (1995 - 2003) and shoot tremendous 1500 hours of raw video, cut than to 1:45 hours (the future dvd release will contain much more material than the original film). the result is astonishing - there are no fillers - the film is 100% pure and genuine archive footage, which gives you feeling as film progresses that you live with the bands, through all these years.  both bands in the start of their careers promised to ""make a revolution"" in the music making, and not to sell their souls to the devil of ""record industry"". however, their paths quickly diverged - the dandy warhols signed a contract with capitol records and became relatively popular (especially in europe) after only one album, while the brian jonestown massacre (with its self-destruction-bound leader anton newcombe) dissolved into oblivion (at least how it is portrayed in the film). and the movie follows the descent of the brian jonestown massacre, contrasted by the ascent of the dandy warhols.  first, i was delighted by the movie and its approach of telling the story of anton newcombe (for example, courtney taylor - the leader of the dandy warhols - narrates), but after some thinking i realized that something is wrong with this film.  first, it treats anton newcombe as a disappeared person. the project started in 1995 as a documentary about several promising emerging groups, in which anton newcombe and ondi timoner were equal partners (that was the reason why all these years ondi timoner had unmediated access to the both bands). it was anton newcombe who brought the dandy warhols into the project. in the end he was ignored completely, as if he was kicked out of the project. everybody talk about bjm, but he does not take part in the discussion. i guess he wasn't even informed when the group started the final editing process. there are always both sides of the story, and here we have only one... of course, as one would expect, anton does not approve the final result and sees this movie as a betrayal of his former friends.  second, the film is very dandy warhols-biased. sure, the winner takes it all, but the fact that courtney taylor (leader of dw) narrates (even though it seems a good choice - it provides a feeling of seemingly closer involvement) and that bands' late history is represented nonproportionally (bjm is covered till 1997, and dw - till 2003), does not add objectivity to the film.  third, the movie is (somewhat) shallow. what does it want to teach us? as one critic said: ""... movie examines old questions: where does genius fit into a commodified world? can it thrive and get its due, or does it need to self-destruct to preserve its integrity?"" no, it does not examine these questions! it just depicts a story of a brilliant, but unsuccessful musician, narrated by a less brilliant, but successful one, who indulges in self-assurance and eternal coolness of an ego greater than mountain.  anyway, the movie was fun - it's raw, it's fresh, it's stylish, it's ... just god damn interesting, at least for the dw or bjm fans. for the rest of the crowd - i don't know...",1
"sadly, more downs than ups. the plot was pretty decent. i mean, nothing out of the ordinary, but it had a story, unlike the other modern horror flicks. the other good thing was the cast. i'm not saying that the acting was good, because it wasn't, but every actor/actress was hot and attractive.  one of the downs are that the movie only become exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. the rest was quite boring. another down (or you could consider it an up if you want) is the excessive nudity. all 4 girls were topless for a few minutes, and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. it's not that i'm against nudity, but this was a horror movie, not 'the dreamers'.  unless you're very desperate to watch some guy take off his swimsuit and run around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl get naked for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of debbie rochon, than this is the movie for you. but if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away.",0

"the dialogue was pretty dreadful. the plot not really all that inspired beyond the obvious twist it presents. not visually stunning. actually visually annoying at times. most definitely one of those films you find easier to finish if you keep one finger on the fast forward button. if you could watch it for free, have absolutely no other options open at the moment and you really dig seeing the little poltergeist lady... well maybe i'd recommend it to you, but not anyone else i could think of at the moment.",0
"this show is good. i like the acting, funny bits and the cuteness of it. the actors, lee pace, ann friel... etc, they all did great in the show. the show started off great with its funny, illogical basic idea of bringing dead people back in the first series and honestly, as what people said, the first few episodes of the second series were a bit of a let down but it later came back looking good anyway. and now i really hate the fact that it's going to be cancelled. why doesn't abc just let it finish until the very end when all the episodes are already done?? i really wanna know how the story's going to be. i think it should be given a chance as there're still so many viewers who love it.",1
"many mystery stories follow the standard whodunit path: murder most foul, gathering of clues, gaggle of possible perps, sprinkling of red herrings, and inevitable showdown between clever evildoer and even more clever crime solver.  ""forgotten"" abandons the well-trod and gives us complex characters who may or may not have committed terrible acts. the fact that at the end of three episodes we have no easy answers and no neatly-tied package might frustrate some, but for me it was the indication of an intelligently crafted tale which probes, disturbs, and haunts with the question: what does an evil person look like?  excellent acting and production combine to make a mystery not easily... forgotten.",1
"you have to figure that when the star's name is listed wrong in the opening credits, you are not in for a good time (the credit reads ""cuba gooding, j.r.""). some nice car chase, shoot 'em up, blow 'em up action if all you want is action, because the relationship to what plot exists is tenuous at best, and completely unbelievable. the motivations of the characters, especially that of gooding's at the end, are worse then unbelievable, they are irrational when they are not hopelessly muddled. all i can think is that andy cheng must be a really nice guy to get this many good actors into this foul a project (he can't have something on all of them, can he?).",0
"the last hunt is the forgotten hollywood classic western. the theme of genocide via buffalo slaughter is present in other films but never so savagely. robert taylor's against-type role as the possessed buffalo and indian killer is his finest performance.  in the 1950s, your mom dropped you and your friends off at the saterday matinée, usually featuring a western or comedy. but it was wrong then and now to let a youngster watch psycho-dramas like the searchers and the last hunt. let the kids wait a few years before exposing them to films with repressed sexual sadism and intense racial hatred.  why did mom fail to censor these films? because they featured ""safe"" hollywood stars like taylor and john wayne. but the climatic scene in the last hunt is as horrifying as vincent price's mutation in the fly.  the mythology of the white buffalo, part of the texture of this movie, was later ripped-off by other movies including the white buffalo, starring charles bronson as wild bill hickock. the laugh here is that bronson used to play indians.  today a large remnant bison herd resides in yellowstone national park in wyoming. in the winter, hunger forces surplus animals out of the park into montana, where they are sometimes harvested by idaho's nez perce indians under a us treaty right that pre-dates the lincoln presidency. linclon signed the congressional act which authorized the continental railroad and started the buffalo slaughter.",1
this is a weak film with a troubled history of cuts and re-naming. it doesn't work at all. firstly the dramaturgy is all wrong. it's very slow moving at first and then hastily and unsatisfactorily moves to an end. but there is also (and that may have to do with the cuts) an uneasy moving between genres. it starts off with being a thriller to be taken at face value and then degenerates into a farce rather than satire. the ending may be funny but it's also so blunt that i almost felt it insulted my intelligence (what little there is). so the film tries to be everything but does not really succeed on any level at all. you can also see that in the very unsteady character development.you almost get the impression connery plays three roles rather than one.,0
"lorna green(janine reynaud)is a performance artist for wealthy intellectuals at a local club. she falls prey to her fantasies as the promise of romantic interludes turn into murder as she kills those who believe that sex is on the horizon. it's quite possible that, through a form of hypnotic suggestion, someone(..a possible task master pulling her strings like a puppet)is guiding lorna into killing those she comes across in secluded places just when it appears that love-making is about to begin. after the murders within her fantasies are committed, lorna awakens bewildered, often clueless as to if what she was privy to within her dreams ever took place in reality.  if someone asked me how to describe this particular work from franco, i'd say it's elegant & difficult. by now, you've probably read other user comments befuddled by what this film is about, since a large portion of it takes place within the surreal atmosphere of a dream. franco mentioned in an interview that he was heavily influenced by godard early in his career, as far as film-making style, and so deciding to abandon a clear narrative structure in favor of trying to create a whole different type of viewing experience. and, as you read from the reaction of the user comments here..some like this decision, others find the style labouring, dull, and bewildering. i'll be the first to admit that the film is over my head, but even franco himself, when quizzed by critics who watched ""succubus"", admitted that he didn't even understand the film and he directed it! some might say that ""succubus"" was merely a precursor to his more admired work, ""venus in furs"", considered his masterwork by franco-faithful, because it also adopts the surreal, dreamlike structure where the protagonist doesn't truly know whether he/she is experiencing something real or imagined. in a sense, like the protagonist, we are experiencing the same type of confusion..certainly, ""succubus"" is unconventional film-making where we aren't given the keys to what is exactly going on. and, a great deal of the elusive dialogue doesn't help matters. ""succubus"" is also populated by beatnik types and ""poet-speak"", corman's film, ""a bucket of blood"" poked fun at. my personal favorite scene teases at a possible lesbian interlude between lorna and a woman she meets at a posh party..quite a bizarre fantasy sequence where mannequins are used rather unusually. great locations and jazz score..i liked this film myself, although i can understand why it does receive a negative reaction. loved that one scene at the posh party with lorna, a wee bit drunk, writhing on the floor in a gorgeous evening gown as others attending the shindig(..equally wasted)rush her in an embrace of kisses.",1

"lawrence olivier and merle oberon did two movies together within two years. one is considered one of the great romantic films of all time, and the movie that made olivier a great movie star (and gave oberon her best performance role): wuthering heights. the other is this film, made in england a year earlier. the divorce of lady x is a romantic comedy (as wuthering heights is a romantic tragedy). olivier is a lawyer, everard logan, who is a dynamic barrister, but is also a total misogynist. one night he checks into a hotel just ahead of a crowd of people. it is a very foggy night (the type of pea soup fog that london was known for up until a notorious ""killer"" fog in the 1950s), and the crowd (who'd been attending a party in the hotel) need beds. the management tries to get logan to allow one or two socialite ladies to sleep on a couch and a day bed in his rooms, but he refuses. but he has not reckoned with merle oberon as leslie steele. the granddaughter of a high court judge, she manages to get into logan's rooms and manipulates him to not only agree to her sleeping there, but appropriates his bed (he goes onto the couch - much to his discomfort).  the next day they share a breakfast, and in the smalltalk it is evident that despite his mistrust of women logan finds leslie very attractive. but she kittenishly refuses to tell him her name. she is determined to learn more about him, and she finds his attitude toward women infuriating. in the meantime, logan is approached by a wealthy nobleman (ralph richardson as lord mere) as a potential client. mere suspects his wife lady mere (binnie barnes) of having an affair. in fact, he tells logan her ladyship was with her lover in the hotel that logan knows he was in on the night of the fog. logan (naturally) jumps to the conclusion that lady mere was his mysterious roommate that night. i will not go into the plot any further, except to say that leslie eventually realizes what a mistake logan has made, and decides to use it to teach him a lesson about women.  the script has the feel of a wodehouse novel, but is slighter. still the performances of olivier, oberon, richardson, barnes, and morton selden (as oberon's grandfather) are all splendid. it shows what a good cast can do with even the slightest of materials. take a look at some of the minor scenes to see what i mean: selden's first scene, complaining about his weak coffee to his butler/valet, who tells him off properly (they've been used to each other's personalities for years). or olivier dealing with a young clerk in his office, who is certain there were two lady meres in the office two minutes before (there were, but oberon and barnes left together), and ends up thinking the poor clerk is a simpleton. or the waiter in the hotel who can't understand why the tenant in olivier's room is constantly changing from a man to a woman to a man. as i said, a slight charming comedy - but it is very charming.",1
"seeing as i hate reading long essays hoping to find a point and being disappointed, i will first tell everyone that this movie was terrible. downright terrible. and not, surprisingly for the reasons mentioned in the first review. i thought i might agree with him, seeing as he gave the movie the rank it deserved, but was sorrowfully rebuked upon reading what he said. i am quite ashamed to be taking the same side as someone who commented that the movie ""definitely lacks good-looking females."" let me be the first to say, ""wow! that was definitely some serious in-depth reviewing there. my mind can hardly comprehend the philosophical musings about this movie."" seriously though, a lack of ""good-looking females"" shouldn't be considered an essential to a movie. if you're desperate enough for ""good-looking females"" you should really watch other types of movies, not necessarily falling into the sci-fi category.",0
"there are some things i will never understand; why underwear comes in packs of threes when clearly thats not enough is an example. similarly, i will never understand this film, and that is brilliant. if you approach this film expecting an actual movie, you might as well be approaching satan expecting a hug; although that may well be possible if you greet this film's satanic figures. take pitch for instance; the most ineffectual, camp, unhellish portrayal of a devil since freddy mercury and wayne sleep joined forces to create a ten foot satan costume from red body paint and horns covered with condoms. however, it does create some of the most hilarious moments of any film ever. seriously, this is no understatement. the same can be applied to every other character, bar the little girl who acts so sickly innocent she's probably overcompensating for some serious crime she's part of. then again, if santa's inter-space recon station is real, there is no chance she could have avoided him this long. put simply, if you haven't seen this movie, you cannot consider yourself a serious buff. the achingly funny characterisation, acting, concept, and almost-under-the-radar racism makes this a must see above any film to date (if you're after pure laughter that is).",1
"i'll dispense with the usual comparisons to a certain legendary filmmaker known for his neurotic new yorker persona, because quite frankly, to draw comparisons with bumbling loser josh kornbluth, is just an insult to any such director. i will also avoid mentioning the spot-on satire `office space' in the same breath as this celluloid catastrophe. i can, however, compare it to waking up during your own surgery  it's painful to watch and you wonder whether the surgeons really know what they're doing. haiku tunnel is the kind of film you wish they'd pulled the plug on in its early stages of production. it was cruel to let it live and as a result, audiences around the world are being made to suffer.  the film's premise  if indeed it has one  is not even worth discussing, but for the sake of caution i will. josh kornbluth, a temp worker with severe commitment-phobia, is offered a permanent job. his main duty is to mail out 17 high priority letters for his boss. but ludicrously, he is unable to perform this simple task. my reaction? big deal! that's not a story it's a passing thought at best - one that should've passed any self-respecting filmmaker by.   the leading actor  if you can call him that  is a clumsy buffoon of a man, with chubby features, a receding, untamed hairline, and a series of facial expressions that range from cringe-making to plain disturbing. where o where did the director find this schmuck? what's that you say he is the director? oh, my mistake. playing yourself in your own embarrassment of a screenplay is one thing, but i suspect that mr kornbluth isn't that convincing as a human being, let alone an actor. rest assured, this is by no means an aimless character assassination, but never before have i been so riled up by an actor's on-screen presence! my frustration was further confounded by his incessant to-camera monologues in between scenes. i mean, as if the viewer needs an ounce of intelligence to comprehend this drivel, kornbluth insults us further by `explaining' the action (first rule of filmmaking: `dramatize exposition' show, don't tell). who does this guy think he is? he has no charisma, no charm, and judging by his hawaiian shirts, no sense of style. his casting agent should be shot point blank!  the supporting actors do nothing to relieve the intense boredom i felt, with but one exception. patricia scanlon puts in a very funny appearance as helen the ex-secretary, who has been driven insane by her old boss, and makes harassing phone calls from her basement, while holding a flashlight under her face. this did make me chuckle to myself, but the moment soon passed and i was back to checking my watch for the remainder of the film.  the film's title is also a misnomer. haiku tunnel has nothing to do with the ancient form of japanese poetry. don't be fooled into thinking this is an art house film because of its pretentious-sounding title or the fact that it only played in a handful of cinemas and made no money at the box office there's a very good reason for that!

"fräulein doktor is as good a demonstration as any of how the once great film industry in western europe has declined in the past 40 years. then, in the late 60s, while the big hollywood studios were on the ropes, italy,france and england were turning out movies to fill the void left by hollywood's decline. there were the james bond pictures (doctor no was a surprise hit in the usa, it was first released at the century theater chain in nyc with a 99 cent afternoon admission price), the clint eastwood spaghetti westerns (with a fistful of dollars released by a distributor that never paid the italian producers a dime)and french crime movies that usually went to art houses, with exceptions like the sicilian clan. and there were european co-productions like doctor zhivago and, of course, fräulein doktor. with its big budget for the time, and the world talent involved, fräulein doktor was good enough that viewers still remember the movie decades later.  kenneth more, playing a british intelligence officer, has a line in fräulein doktor where he tells a caught spy to either talk or he will play the wall game. the wall being opposite a firing squad, with little chance of the spy winning the game. that sort of cynical attitude played well across national borders, in the vietnam war era of 1969.  the steamy scenes between suzy kendall and capucine probably did not damage these performers' chances at getting parts in hollywood movies, hollywood studios were in the process of shedding their overseas distribution and production businesses. fox would no longer co-produce films like the sicilian clan, columbia wouldn't distribute films like belmondo's the night caller. mgm went even further, cutting almost all film production, selling its chain of theaters in india for the value of the land underneath and unloading its borehamwood studio facilty as kerkorian looted the studio to raise money for building his casino in las vegas (where a bally casino gift shop sold mgm memorabilia at giveaway prices, stuff left over from the auction of mgm's prop warehouses).  paramount distributed fräulein doktor, but gulf and western's charles bludhorn, who had taken over the company and canned the studio's aged board of directors, unloaded the studio's film library to universal (as i recall) and really became interested in movies after production chief robert evans started turning out one hit after another. but that was in the 70s. fräulein doktor with its lesbian scene was buried, with cut versions of the movie showing up on local stations through the 80s.  kenneth more was usually typecast as a bumbling guy when he was older, especially in the bbc detective series father brown. when he was younger, as in the british movie titanic, he played his standard reserved british officer. in fräulein doktor, he had a chance to be a lot tougher than usual, as i recall. it would be nice to see if my memory of this movie is accurate, about his role and, of course, those cavalry horses wearing gas masks and protective covers riding into battle. that was some scene, and alberto lattuada showed he was some director, helming this world war i espionage movie, where the money spent on production values really shows up on the screen.",1

"this movie has everything. emotion, power, affection, stephane rideau's adorable naked beach dance... it exposes the need for real inner communion and outer communication in any relationship. just because cedric and mathieu are a couple who happen to be gay doesn't mean there isn't quite useful insight for anybody in it. i would probably classify it as a gay movie, but one that can be appreciated and loved by heterosexual people as well as homosexual and bisexual people. mathieu's incapacity to handle his emotions divulges the way our society doesn't encourage us to act any differently, and that is what engenders the discord between him and cedric. this is definitely a must-see!!!!",1
"this film has a powerful philosophical ending. but that ending has meaning only if you watch the movie from the beginning.  youth alienation in the late 1960's, from the viewpoint of a young man and a young woman, is the obvious theme of ""zabriskie point"". neither mark frechette nor daria halprin had much acting experience, a fact that actually enhances the film's message. having untrained actors conveys a sense of realism, as both players seem emotionally detached from the turmoil around them.  this is not a script-driven film. except for the first ten minutes, it is mostly visual, with stunning cinematography. the beautiful naturalistic images seem other-worldly, and perfectly in sync with the emotional detachment of mark and daria.  i would have replaced the thematically weak pink floyd music with the more cogent music of the doors. many scenes cry out for ""riders on the storm"".  even so, i like this film. it's different; it's unique; it is artistic and imaginative. and the desert badlands are beautiful.  as the years go by, ""zabriskie point"" seems more and more attractive. it conveys the mood of the late 1960's in america. it is amazingly artistic, in a bohemian sort of way. and the film's last eight minutes are philosophically mesmerizing.",1

"and i gave it a high 7.....  why? because it bloody well rocked. at the time when there were so many other shows on that were tied to toys/games this show was unique in that it had overlapping stories. as others have said here it was ahead of its time.   sadly this is why the show was doomed. they have released 4 dvds with 16 episodes of the series so far. i am hoping that more come out.   how does this compare watching it now 20 years after it first came out.. i don't know i still like it despite the sometimes clunky animation, and that imho is it's only flaw. the writing was almost top notch and way ahead of the competition........   i do hope for more dvds or even a set of all the episodes in proper order... the dvds are good but i don't think the stories are in their proper order, but despite this the show rocked.",1
"i wasn't expecting a lot from a film directed by sidney j. furie and starring dolph lundgren but i was surely expecting more than a got. a one-liner user comment - 2nd rate action movie - didn't seem too depreciative to me for a lundgren film. on the other hand, i wouldn't have bothered to watch this film if its rating was below 5.0 but hey, the movie had a 5.9 out of 10 score, which seemed pretty acceptable to me for this kind of production.  now i understand that the 37.5% of people who rated this film a 10 (excellent) was clearly a publicity stunt because detention is the regular nu image garbage you have seen before, over and over.  lundgren does not convince as an ex-military turned a history teacher assigned to a rough school. his acting is just plain terrible, emotionless and contrived. lundgren's inability to act becomes more visible in the scenes with the juvenile delinquent kids. either they are great actors or, compared to lundgren, they seem great actors - just because they seem natural and believable.  detention has some elements that could have been potentially interesting for this low budget movie - a closed-for-weekend high-security high school, four teens in detention with a war-veteran teacher and a group of ruthless criminals trying to get in - but the story (something like the breakfast club meets die hard, or is it panic room?) is full of unbelievable situations, lots of clichés and stereotypical characters. and let's not forget dolph lundgren is the main actor.  alex karzis and kata dobó play a bonnie and clyde couple in love and they deliver the most acceptable performances of the movie, even if he seems a low-budget version of sam rockwell and she, a milla jovovich wanna-be. in a movie where everything fails, their craziness and style supplied enough fresh air to prevent my interest from dropping to ground zero.",0
"this film's premise is so simple and obvious that only a texas millionaire high on oil fumes and whiskey would have a problem understanding it if someone shouted it across the proverbial parking lot. in summary: the oil business is in cahoots with the government (or gummint if you prefer), the gummint is in cahoots with middle eastern despots, and the cia is a singular festering pool of double dealing sons-of-(insert word) willing to toe any line that comes their way. the only people that get done over are the good ones, like mr clooney (""bob""). oh, and terrorism is a result of the poverty which globalization creates when wicked multinationals stalk the world looking for a tasty takeover or three . that really fits to the profiles of the well-heeled 9/11 perpetrators.  in syriana this facile tissue of political half-truths and hollywood holograms is stirred up in a repugnant vermicelli of story strands that twist, turn and whirl through the gloopy circumlocutions of their own insignificance until the poor viewer is left alone with the conclusion that:   1. the ""director"" (good joke) should never be let near a camera again   2. people like clooney and hurt might know how to act, but they sure don't know how to pick a script   3. if you want to see a film that deals with corruption in big business and the state, go and see claude chabrol's ""l'ivresse du pouvoir"", which is insightful, funny and brilliantly acted.   empty, doom-laden sententious piffle spun out to evening-ruining length.",0
"in the hands of a more skilled director, this film would have been considered a horror masterpiece. despite michael ""death wish"" winner's merely passable direction, the movie is interesting, original and more than a little scary.  the script bucks more than one horror cliché off its back (several it can't shake) including chris sarandon as the heroine's boyfriend who actually listens to her as she insists that eerie things are going down. burgess meredith is delightful as the lovably insane neighbor. eva gardner is haunting with a young beverly d'angelo as her mute and disturbed lesbian lover. john carradine does a heck-of-a job sitting in a chair. and watch out for a brief cameo from an unknown-at-the-time chris walken! this movie is creepy and creative. the plot twists are lovely, if a tad predictable. the climax, of which i will give no detail, is disturbing and quite impressive. again a better director could have done more with it, nonetheless it is quite satisfying - at least to those with the sensibilities of seventies horror.  if you like modern overproduced body-counting torture-fantasy, you won't like this. there is almost no gore. the direction is quite spartan. the effects are few, although there's some delightful makeup near the end - most of which actually isn't makeup...but perhaps i've said too much already.  i've rated this a little higher than its quality may justify, but i enjoyed it as much as any ""8"" film that i've seen.",1
"also known as ""stairway to heaven"" in the us. during wwii british peter carter's (david niven) plane is shot down in combat but he survives. he meets and falls in love with lovely june (kim hunter). but it seems a mistake was made in heaven--he should have died! a french spirit comes to get him but he refuses. he is soon to plead his case in front of a heavenly tribunal that he should be allowed to live.  sounds ridiculous but this is actually an incredible film. the script is good with the actors playing the roles completely straight-faced and it's beautifully directed--the scenes on earth are in breath-taking technicolor (i've never seen such beautiful blue skies) and the scenes in heaven are in black and white! niven is a little stiff at times but hunter is just great (and very beautiful) and roger livesey is superb as a doctor trying to help niven. the imagery throughout is amazing (especially the staircase and during the final trial sequence) and the special effects are truly great (considering the age of the film). there's also a very strange sequence when niven runs into a totally nude young boy herding sheep! this is an absolutely beautiful, thought provoking film--highly recommended. this remains unknown in the us which is a shame.",1

"i love this tv series so much. it contains animation that is interesting and beautiful. i cant believe that they cut it off tv, and also that i never found out whether cybersix and data7 die or not, apparently they survive, but i'm not sure. cybersix was by far the best tv show ever. i know its to late to hope they will start the series over again so i'm really glad i got to watch it. i luved it so much <3   its about a women by the name of cybersix, she is not human. she goes by adrian sieldman, a man teacher at a highschool. now cybersix is actually a women, she is just disguised as a man in the day. by night cybersix patrols the city.  a guy by the name of von reichter is the one who created cybersix, and once he finds put she is alive he uses everything he can to capture her.  if u have never watched it before u should totally download it. it was the best tv show in the world. why did they cut it off???? some people have issues. but i'm glad i got to watch the 13 episodes.",1
"i watched full house when i was younger and i can not understand why i did. i don't remember really enjoying the show. i think i and the majority of americans watching this were hypnotized by its badness. it will put you in a trance state and there is no going back. i am still scarred but i try to move on. i know it's a family show but that does not mean it has to be so bad. the show is so cliché with every episode ending with a ""talk"" from the dad to make everyone's problems go away. the characters on the show are all loathsome. there is a know it all, cleaning obsessed, corny father who you want to punch in the face every time he comes on screen. we then have a supposed ""rocker"" uncle that is just there to look pretty for the moms that have to watch this crap. we have another uncle who is completely unfunny who does lame bullwinkle impressions (need i say more about him). there is the eldest daughter who can not act and is always whining about something. then a middle daughter who always says, ""how rude!"" to pretty much everything anyone says. finally, there is the youngest daughter michelle. do not get me started on michelle played but the horrible actors known as the olsen twins. if you believe in christianity i guess you would associate her with the antichrist. she is always demanding things, trying too hard to be ""cute"", is constantly saying ""duh!"" and rolling her eyes which makes you want to smack her. i am not a big fan of using a lot of physical abuse as punishment to children. but in her case, i would make an acceptation. she needed it on a daily basis. she is the most selfish character to ever be introduced to mainstream television. one example of this is when her rocker uncle is busy doing his job in the attic. the brat decides to constantly annoy him and demand attention. he yells at her and she gets upset. poor baby! the rest of the episode is catering to her emotional needs and the uncle eventually apologizes to her. ugghh! the show will lower your iq along with slowly destroying your will to live. i am surprised we don't hear in the news about full house being played in the background when police find people that have committed suicide. do yourself a favor and do not watch reruns of the show. you will thank me later.",0
"taken in the context of the time it was made, i found this a worthwhile movie. while the details may be 'dramatized', the overall history was a nice primer. in addition, i found spotting actors i knew a real pleasure. who would imagine ben cartwright as a dastardly cad? i'll leave the rest of the star spotting to you. as to the secondary casting, this movie (as one would expect from a movie made in the late thirties) has many an enjoyable character actor, but top kudos' to andrew jackson's right hand man peavey. the perfect touch of comedy. well shot, with beautiful ships, and competent acting throughout out, i recommend this for anyone with a taste for the slightly camp, or an eye for a double-period piece, set at the dawn of america, and made in a period when great names, and top notch character actors, were a real pleasure to enjoy.",1
"you've got to admire director todd sheets for his dedication, drive and enthusiasm when it comes to movie-making: between 1985 and 2000, he made a whopping 34 films. unfortunately, if his zombie bloodbath trilogy is anything to go by, they're probably all crap (and a quick look at their imdb ratings seems to verify my hunch).  part 3 sees a group of obnoxious students finding detention a little more eventful than usual after they are attacked by hordes of the living dead, who have escaped from a top-secret army base located directly beneath their school. working from a dreadful script by brian eklund (which relies heavily on liberal use of the f-bomb) director sheets delivers yet another embarrassingly amateurish effort featuring some mind-numbingly awful performances from his talent-free cast, dreadful visual effects (some crap cgi and what looks like the front of a giant cardboard space-shuttle) and his trademark shoddy gore (handfuls of offal pulled from beneath his victims' clothing).  finally, after what seems like an eternity watching irritating characters running for their lives, and unconvincing undead people fondling animal innards, zombie armageddon finishes with a time-travel/paradox twist ending which forces viewers to re-watch several torturous minutes from the beginning of the film. honestly... once was enough, mr. sheetswhat have we done to deserve having to watch it again?",0

"""the matador"" is a dark comedy starring pierce brosnan as an aging hit man who befriends a straight-arrow, happily-married american businessman (greg kinnear) in mexico. although the sardonic julian (ironically surnamed ""noble"") appears to be a ""tough guy"" on the surface, underneath he is really just a mass of neuroses and insecurities, a man who realizes that his chosen profession has left him virtually alone in the world and friendless. thus on his birthday, he reaches out to danny, a man who has lived his life playing by the rules and who becomes strangely intrigued by julian's ""unconventional"" lifestyle. in fact, both men find in each other the person they could never be but wish they could become in their quieter, franker moments of self-evaluation.  although the film is a bit too reminiscent of ""analyze this"" and ""midnight run"" to feel entirely fresh and original, ""the matador,"" nevertheless, earns points for the complexity of its characters and the quality of its acting. brosnan, looking aged and almost used up, sinks his teeth into the role of julian in a way he never has before. playing a man who seems constitutionally unable to make a serious connection with another human being, brosnan is flip and cavalier one moment, then genuine and sympathetic the next. he always keeps us off balance so that the humor never becomes crass or stale. kinnear is also excellent as the regular joe businessman who finds himself pulled ever more to the dark side as his relationship with julian deepens. hope davis does a fine job as ""bean,"" danny's loyal and loving wife who, like her husband, finds herself intrigued by this mysterious and ""dangerous"" figure from a world far different from the one she knows.  at times, we find ourselves feeling that ""the matador"" is holding something back from us, not quite plumbing the depths of its situation and premise. at the end it feels a little too light, a little too insubstantial to register the impact it should. this could be because this is the feature film debut for writer/director richard shephard, and he hasn't quite gotten his movie pacing down yet. still, one appreciates the fact that he doesn't always go for the obvious and that he keeps tightly focused on the two main figures in the piece, rarely settling for the trite setup or the easy laugh.  'the matador"" is a flawed but generally entertaining little comedy that will, hopefully, signal a new phase in brosnan's acting career.",1

"this film really deserves more recognition than its getting. it really is a stunning and rich portrayal of blood ties, favours and allegiances within the crime world. the film is shot beautifully and delves into all you're classic crime themes such as betrayal and power. this film is a movie goers film, it requires attention and understanding and rewards fully in the end. it is the godfather of hong kong and is a welcome change rather than another wire frame fighting, martial arts epic which seems to be the major contribution to the cinema world from hong kong and china. it features an arrangement of great characters, actors and development although is fair to say i had to watch it twice just to nail what was happening with some of the characters due to their being so many interactions in the film. all in all 8/10 great plot characters but there are characters that don't stand out enough and the music didn't really get me going and at times i felt it didn't sync well with the action(there is action by the way) so it loses some points for that.",1
"""the incubus"" is a mix of the good (an interesting murder mystery), the bad (a disconnected script, a sloppy resolution, badly made attack scenes) and the weird (strong incestuous overtones, a strangely sleepy and stiff performance by john cassavetes - was that character really meant to be so ""wacko""?). not nearly as offensive as it's reputed to be, but not particularly successful, either.

"i usually comment only on movies that i like, figuring ""everyone to his/her own taste,"" but here i want to make an exception. the premise of this movie, which somehow seems to get lost in the shuffle, is that these two self-centered adults have a perfect right to go off to las vegas, get drunk, get married, and inflict incalculable suffering upon their respective broods of children. even allowing for the culturally sanctioned inebriation, they have neither the courage nor the sense of responsibility to wake up the next morning and undo what they have set in motion. after all, ""love"" is all that's important, isn't it? to hell with everybody else. whether or not things ""work out in the end"" is really not the point; in fact it's quite irrelevant. the point is that disrespect for others, especially if they are young persons, and especially if they are in a position of dependency, is made light of and thereby reinforced by this movie. there are far more innocuous behaviors these ""parents"" could have performed that would have brought down an army of social workers on their heads in a heartbeat.",0
"this movie is an abomination, and its making should have been considered a capital crime.  one of the great mysteries of film-making is why nobody ever has made a faithful movie adaptation of this wonderful mystery. it is a tale of a really gripping mystery, nice old-fashioned romance, and dry english humor. why did the makers have to change richard gordon from a scotland yard policeman to an amateur detective, introduce the idiotic role and caricature of his english servant, change the part of the main storyline about the murder charge and circumstances of gordon's struggle to save the accused, etc., etc.? these producers and directors who always think they can make a better story than the one in the book should write the original script themselves and not to rape another person's product.",0
"the king maker is a film about a series of real (citation needed) events that occurred during the portuguese occupation in indochina.  although the costumes and art direction are commendable, the movie still fails to impress the viewer. the acting, in particular, was extremely poor. some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents, both real and fake, are extremely irritating. the storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson. the movie couldn't even capture that sort of regal and century-old air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an asian version of elizabeth.  final say? costumes and art direction give the film a breath of fresh air, but the execution was extremely poor and the actors couldn't even give natural bursts of emotion. in short, the movie sounded more like hullabaloo than a script.",0
"im going to keep this fairly brief as to not spoil anything for you. this movie is awesome. from beginning to end, it is filled with genuine thrills. the fight scenes are fantastic, the chase scenes are enthralling, and it moves at such a pace that it really only felt slow toward the end when things are explained, but that is only because everything that preceded it. damon shines and really has proved a very solid actor, daring you not to believe him in this role. he is this role. a welcome addition to the series in david straithrain (hope i spelled that close to right) as a seedy cia agent out to kill bourne. this is non stop and will truly leave you on the edge of your seat for most of the way. some things toward the end are just a smidgeon preposterous, thus negating a 10 rating. the ending is left open for sequels and i sure hope that they consider doing more of these, for none have been bad. excellent film all in all and a fantastic ending to an amazing trilogy.  p.s. the shaky cam did not hurt any of the action, but i still think we could do without it. the good news is, you only really notice it when people are talking and not so much the action.",1

"i refused to watch this when it originally aired, treasuring the memory of the late, lamented 1960s series with mike pratt and kenneth cope, but i can never resist a challenge. i should have known better. not quite a remake, and more of a parody than a homage, this show didn't quite know how to play it, and plumped with infantile comedy and cartoon plots and characters. the three main characters were little more than caricatures of the actors, and only emilia fox could act (bob mortimer is painful in a straight role). the supporting cast were merely comedian-acquaintances of vic and bob's wanting to be part of the in-joke, and far too aware of the situation to be convincing. and the cgi, though the effects couldn't help be an improvement on those available 30 years earlier, merely dazzled the viewer with lights and camera work, and did little to mask the poor quality of the scripts and dialogue. all style and no substance. (and whereas the 1960s show is mocked for being very much of its time, this 'update' is now also very dated, with 'matrix'-style fashions, obligatory 'girl power' scenes, and less than subtle tension between the two living leads.)",0
"the first 2 parts seek to reduce to absurdity the rise of wasteful wars and rule by nationalist barbarians. the 3rd part speculates that progress and exploration toward the moon and beyond is the key to ensuring a meaningful use of human talents and resources. it has speeches that some viewers dismiss as naive or bombastic but that make others tingle with excitement. it depicts a space gun/launcher and a helicopter, along with inventive mass communication devices, elevators, flat screen panels, and wireless intercoms. it's probably incorrect about windowless buildings in the future. but it portrays a child-like vision of boundless scientific/technological investigation.  to me, it seems like a movie about a group of rational minded thinkers guided by a spinozean-like morality in their quest to immortalize themselves and live ethically through scientific advancement and a unified world government. the pro-progress characters (such as the two cabals) believe humanity could 'live forever' by preserving our experiments and progress for future generations, always standing on our humanity as if on the shoulders of giants.  arthur c. clarke (author of 2001: a space odyssey) suggested this film to stanley kubrick as an example of an excellent sf movie. kubrick hated it and said he would never watch another movie based on clarke's suggestions (source: clarke's special millennial introduction to his 2001 novel). though the late clarke kept suggesting it at the top of his list whenever someone asked him about the best sf movies. it has a beautiful menzies art design, but mediocre special effects (esp. the toy tanks).  i personally loved it and think it excellently captures the zeitgeist of modernity. it is a bit naive about the plausibility of creating a society without crime for an extended period of time. it also seems implausible about the inevitability of progress. it seems to me we could just as easily go right back to the dark ages or at least become so stagnant in science that we kill ourselves off through overpopulation or through our inability to escape the next major natural disaster. but it nicely portrays the importance of taking risks against public and nanny outrage for potential threats of space accidents and deaths. it challenges us to choose the side of progress over petty desires for safety or comfort or happiness:  cabal: ""too much {rest} and too soon, and we call it death. but for man no rest and no ending. he must go on--conquest beyond conquest. this little planet and its winds and ways, and all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. then the planets about him, and at last out across immensity to the stars. and when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time--still he will be beginning.""   cabal: ""if we are no more than animals--we must snatch at our little scraps of happiness and live and suffer and pass, mattering no more--than all the other animals do--or have done."" {he points out at the stars.} ""it is that--or this? all the universe--or nothingness..."" (quotes from screenplay).  if this sounds like a rationalization for devoting all of society to progress, then the council members (of the world government) will seem like technocrats. but actually those ""technocrats"" allow their citizens to become artisans or pursue other passions freely, and they would have to be suppressed by government bans, laws against science and experiment, and other mandates and restrictive uses of power that would turn their critics into tyrants.  in fact a huge group of rebels in the plot feel belittled by all the council's developments of science and technology, so they try to put a stop to progress and an end the council's freedom to experiment. the progress oriented council will not suppress the free speech of the rebels though, only preparing its 'peace gas' in times of emergency and merely wanting the freedom and space to pursue its progress.  so it's also a story about the freedom to do science, just as much as it's about the wonders of progress. many people in our society would actually agree with some of these basic premises, except in cases of social bias (many want to ban cloning, for example) or naturalism (some don't want us to progress freely, and would rather we just become extinct in due time while enslaved to the earth) or fear/reason (some believe we aren't ready for advanced science/technology since we might destroy ourselves). but cabal (the president of the council) has an answer to the problem of danger: ""our {scientific} revolution did not abolish death or danger. it simply made death and danger worth while"" (screenplay).",1
"by dane youssef  a gang of crooks. the perfect plan. it all goes wrong. they're in trouble. the police are outside. they're cornered. what are they gonna do now?  sound familiar?  the movie seems like it's trying to be a combination of the acting workshop, the ""indie"" film and the theater.  it's the kind of things that actors love--it's kind of like a workshop or a play because it mostly consists of tight focusing on the actors acting... acting angry, tense, scared, conversing, scheming, planning--giving the performers a lot of free range to really ham it all up.  a trio of crooks, one leader, one goon, one brother, come up with a big heist scheme... and a monkey wrench is thrown into the works. to top things off, there's a bit of a ""fender-bender"" and one of the crooks in flung through the back of the windshield.  the cops are on their tail and they stumble into a bar named poetically (and leadenly) ""dino's last chance.""  spacey, as a director, tries to keep the focus on the actors' performances and delivery of dialouge. he pans over to a bright passion-red cigarette ad of a smoking and smoldering bogart. and he keeps all the violence off-screen, really.  i think that was a mistake. focusing on the intensity and gruesome violent scenes would have given the movie some edge.  the problem with the movie is that it moves too slow and suffers from miscasting in almost every role. matt dillon (""drugstore cowboy"" and ""wild things"") seems too young and too idealistic to be the leader of this gang.  gary sinese seems to brooding and deep in thought to be a spineless tag-along with these guys and joe mantaga is effective as the traditional routine foul-swearing mad-dog police lieutenant who's all thumbs, but he isn't given anything to really do here.  william fischter is the only actor who is believable in his role as a brainless grunt who just wants to spill blood.  and the crooks are in a tense situation where they either go to jail or they try to think of some way out of this.  spacey lacks the ability to create a lot of tension and keep it going. the characters are mostly chatting away, trying to think of a plan... and they're to calm and too articulate. there's even a scene where the crooks are playing pool with a whole swarm of armed cops right outside, ready to strike. at one point, one of the crooks even call the police who are right outside the bar. oh brother. oh bother.  these cops are going to either blow them away or going to lock them up. shouldn't the holed-up crooks be a little scared, a little uneasy? meanwhile, all the real action is happening inside.  someone whips out a gun, a baseball bat, which leads to an ugly confrontation off-screen and there's one more casualty that happens that's... well, kinda sad. but...  faye dunaway also should have spent more time with a dialect coach, improving on her new orleans accent. skeet ullrich is fine in a smaller part.  a cop listening in reaches for a pack of matches at the absolute worst time is a nice look. and so is a scene where someone goes right through the rear windshield.   the dialouge is obviously trying to go for a david mamet approach and it's as profane, but never as realistic or as insightful.  the movie feels like too much of what it really is... a really low-budget movie with an actor behind the camera for the first time directing other actors from a script that's ""not bad, but needs a few more re-writes."" spacey shows he's not a terrible director, but he lacks a sort of feel for ""shaping a movie"" and it feels like he's just filming actors act.  these actors are all talented and could work with the material, but they all feel out of place. as i said before, the movie really suffers from miscasting.   i don't mean that the wrong actors were cast. i think they found just the right cast, but placed them in all the wrong roles. i think switching some of the roles would've helped immensely.  having veteran mob actor joe mantagna play the leader of the pack, gary sinese as the angry police lieutenant outside on his bullhorn giving orders and barking at his troops, keeping fischter in his ""bloodthirsty goon"" part and matt dillion as the sacrificial lamb. that would have been a big improvement.  when some actors direct, it works. they can even win oscars for it. but a lot of the time, when actors direct, they have a tendency to just focus on the performances. just shoot the actors acting.  sometimes it works... but they need a good showcase for it. an excuse for it.  hostage situations are all pretty much the same in real life just like coming-of-age stories so it's only natural that movies about them will go from point a to point b as well.  there are a few really great entries into this genre.' spacey himself appeared in a similar movie about hostage situations: ""the negotiator.""  this certainly won't become a cult classic, let alone one of afi's 100. still, it does have a few nice moments and personal touches, but in the end, it's instantly forgettable and the kind of movie that would play best on regular tv. it's just not worth going out of your way to see.  i give a 3 out of 10.   spacey's other directorial credit, ""beyond the sea"" was reportedly a better effort. hmmm... maybe it's true. you need to fail before you succeed.  by dane youssef",0

if the writer/director is reading this (and i imagine you are since you should now be out of work) then i must tell you - i have seen some bad movies in my time but this one gets the distinction of having the worst premise i've ever heard.  spoilers - nothing happens!   a total waste of time. i laughed out loud at the end.   side note - (if the whole movie was her in a coma then does the scene where she sleeps with that guy mean someone raped her while she was knocked out?)  utter rubbish.,0
"as others have noted, this should have been an excellent hammer-style film, and it seems to me that that's how most of the actors were instructed to play it... but the screenplay is so leaden, poorly paced, and filled with a lot of dull soliloquies (poor timothy dalton is saddled with most of them) that it's all too overblown and self-important. this is an uncharacteristically weak performance from dalton, although he quietly nails the climactic scene where dr. rock finally realizes what he's done. the only actor who comes off really well is patrick stewart who is a most welcome sight. freddie francis may have been a great cinematographer, but he was a lousy director.",0
"man about the house is a true situation comedy in every sense of the word. the comedy concerns a character called robin tripp (played by the great richard o' sullivan) who finds himself after a wild party, ending up at the home of two ladies called jo and chrissy. ironically the party was held to say goodbye to their old flatmate. the obvious ends up happening as he moves in.  man about the house was a pre-cursor to cooke and mortimer's spin off show george and mildred which featured the 2 characters who were landlords to jo, chrissy and robin. these two characters would actually turn out to be the linchpins of man about the house with mildred (the late and much missed yootha joyce) in particular getting some of the best lines of the series. a semi-regular character was larry (doug fisher) a useless person who was always on the scrounge and only ever came round when he wanted to borrow something (and never to return it).  the american's did a version called three's company but it doesn't stand a chance when compared to this far funnier original. thames took a risk in producing a comedy about a man sharing a flat with 2 women at a very conservative time but they should worry as the ratings at the time suggest that around 20 million people just wanted to watch a good old fashioned bit of comedy with inspired casting and a sharp script. what a pity modern comedy can't reach that high standard.  this programme is available on network dvd",1
"gung ho was a good idea, however it is to much to ask americans viewers to understand the dynamics of american jobs and foreign competition.in this movie the main character hunt stevenson(michael keaton) goes to japan and convinces a japanese auto company to come to america and help his dying pennslyvania town. two things come at you.first why would a japanese company come to america to make cars when they do so ,and so well at that? secondly can anyone understand that american companies of all types go to third world nations to have their products made to escape american labor costs? it makes the film's premise then that the number one maker of cars in the world would go to one of its' top competitors(aside from germany)and put a plant there as unrealistic. keaton was still in his comedy mode by this time. but he gives a credible performance all the same as he could prove that he could go from comedy to drama in a matter of seconds and still not embarrass himself but director ron howard can't keep this from becoming a tv movie which it ends up being anyway because they have to give the unlikely story a happy ending the politics and problems of japanese and american relations not withstanding. gung ho has a happy days and laverne and shirley feel to it as the producers of both tv shows made the film and then made the tv version of this movie as well which gives the film its' lightweight feel.the japanese manager gets to love his american workers and feels he and other japanese people can learnfrom americans.his no.2 man saito who supposedly doesn't like americans all that much doesn't think so.i would have prefered all the japanese characters been like saito than the soft goofball characters they made the japanese out to be.it would have made the film more interesting.",0

"unfortunately, this has been showing on star movies here in thailand for the last week or so. it's complete rubbish acting. as another member said, this movie is a good example of 'how not to act.' i haven't seen a movie so poorly acted in a long time. the actors (can you call them 'actors'?) are completely flat and deliver their lines with the passion of a dead dog. i would say that in order to truly understand how bad the acting is, you would have to see the movie... but that would be akin to torture.  i cringe as the leading lady delivers her lines, and the rest of the cast with their accents (fake or contrived) is equally heinous. another actress with the fake british accent was pretty, yes, but good lord was her accent terrible. mix that with her (lack of) acting and you have a disaster. she should just have said nothing and i could have accepted her as the pretty girl. oh my, we just got to the scene where the leading lady's lover says ""really me?"" after a forced crying scene from her. laughable. no, really, i just laughed out loud.  the sets and the art directors offer some saving grace to the film. some of the sets are colorful and some of the scenes are rather nice (minus the actors).  the old magic potion lady? what?! another member mentioned the 'modern' love song that was in the movie. totally inappropriate for a period piece set some 500 years ago.  i understand the movie was considered 'big budget' in thailand at the time of it's production. i would be seriously upset if i were the producer of this movie. just goes to show that money does not necessarily make a good (or even mediocre) film.  i would give the king maker a 1 out of 10, but the costumes and sets make save the film from such a rating. 2 out of 10.",0
"""a classic is something that everybody wants to have read but nobody wants to read. a classic is also something that everyone praises but no one has read."" -mark twain  'classic' seems to be the word used to describe ""scarface"", brian depalma's 1983 film about opulence, self surrender, greed, and danger among florida's drug ring. people and critics (and rappers for that matter) deem this film 'an epic gangster classic' or 'eptiome of gangster films.' when it is anything but. it is praised for all the wrong reasons. scarface is a terrific film that deserves praise from all over, but not all the praise it gets from audiences today, and therefor the fine points it so poignantly makes are missed by the general public.  first off, the film is about a cuban refugee, with a past of wanting to escape communism grasp and find happiness. simple? yes. but the layers of de palma's directing genius, and the great story written by oliver stone (yes i know, he actually wrote a real good one here) play into all of it. the characters are all looking for an escape, as escape is a natural element dealt with in the film by all. each character has something to offer, that makes them likable by everyone who could appreciate this film. they are entwined in a world of mystique and money, but all that has a price, as they all learn. each character thinks they are getting better chances in life, when in true dramatic irony, they are actually getting worse. 'tragedy' would be a better word to describe this movie. all those who praise the film for it's drug usage, it's violence, it's dialog, totally missed the point. there is nothing really positive about the film besides the characters positive expectations of themselves. and that is why the film works so well. the devastation through out the film serves to deliver the message of the film, not to look cool or attract viewers. brian de palma doesn't make movies for cult gangsters, or brainless action fans.  next on, the film is an adult drama. it is not a 'gangster film'. it has it's share of action, but the action is plotted very carefully, so it has a point. it's not like ""aliens""- an example of a big dumb action film, and most audiences perceive this film as a big dumb action gangster film about doing drugs and shooting people. ridiculous. hogwash. if this film is about that, then it is about how bad it is. not a promotion of it.   this being said, the film is indeed a great film. it has great cinematography that pulls you into the story. it has a very dramatic score (in true giorgio moroder style), which simply could give you chills, or bring you to tears. the film is rather lengthy, but it is a story, and each moment counts. the acting is terrific. al pacino - enough said. he can do any role that he puts his mind to, and this was no exception. pretty boy steven bauer, as manny. i didn't think much of him in other films he did, but he actually makes you like him when he goes under maestro de palma's direction. michelle pfeiffer is a true gem as elvira. popping' fresh off the heels of a sort of embarrassment in ""grease 2"" she got her ticket to ride performing a no holds barred performance of a beauty that is more than meets the eye. but the three true diamonds in this rough are mary elizabeth mastrontonio as tony's sister gina, who when she smiles, or cries, we see her soul and her fresh way of living, and watch it deteriorate; paul shenar as alejandro sosa, a drug lord, who runs deeper than a river, and shenar portrays him as so; and miriam colom as tony and gina's torn mother. these three dig the film as deep as it can go.   this reviewer learned one main thing when watching ""scarface"" for the first time. always go into a film unsuspecting. all the hype and talk of this film cannot possibly prepare you for what you really see. only knowing de palma (like i do) can give you even a glimpse of what this film holds. so ignore the rap crap, ignore the mindless violence supporters, and fix yourself a glass of bailey's on the rocks, and indulge yourself in an emotional viewing of a great film, the real ""scarface.""",1
"as i watch this film, it is interesting to see how much it marginalizes black men. the film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black man in it is (save for an heroic moment). for much of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film are way in the background, barely visible.  vanessa williams' character was strong and sympathetic. the viewer can easily identify and sympathize with her. there are also some fairly visible and three-dimensional support characters who are light-skinned, and some white characters of some warmth and dignity. but 99% of the black males in this film are nothing but invisible men. voiceless shadows in the background, of no consequence. such a horrible flaw, but anything but unusual in the mainstream media.",0
"we all know what's like when we have a bad day at the office, right? well, this neil simon comedy looks at what it's like when you have the worst of all days just trying to get to the office. sometimes, it's just not worth going, know what i mean? and, sometimes, it's just not worth doing something when it's already been done before, in 1970, with jack lemmon and sandy dennis... and much better also.  it's not that steve martin is a lousy comedian or wrong for the role as the harried and stressed advertising exec; quite to the contrary, on both counts. and, it's not that goldie hawn is equally inept either; her work has been consistently good, if not great, ever since i first saw her in tv's rowan and martin's laugh-in of the 1960s.  the problem with this movie is that it's not about the hapless couple at all: it's really about new york and why everybody should come to new york to live and love their lives away in married bliss  sort of  in the greatest city in the world. that's if you're a new yorker...  look, the 1970 movie is still an excellent comedy that realistically explored all the things that can go wrong when you take a trip somewhere, and included most of the situations and sight gags that you can imagine about what can happen to you in a strange environment. this 1999 version unfortunately goes off into gratuitous tangents specifically for an audience these days that expects or wants to see excess. for example, not content with the star appeal of the main players, there is a cameo (relatively long also) from rudy giuliani, then mayor of new york, as we all know. what  giuliani bucking for president even then? worse  a walking talking advertisement for the kinder face of new york.  and then we have john cleese, reprising his role as basil fawlty  but this time, as a prancing cross-dresser also  once again browbeating hotel staff, sycophantically sucking up to rich customers and generally making himself look like the idiot he is, in this role. and, in the process, doing great damage to the memory of fawlty towers, arguably the best british comedy series, bar none...  why was this 1999 movie made? in the 1970s, new york was a dying city, in many ways. it was almost literally bankrupt. so, when made in 1970, that was the city you saw: grim, dark, moody, unsettling and not the place that the harassed couple finally chose for their new life together in the big smoke (as it was then, polluted and all). by 1999, things had gotten better: glitz was back, new york was thriving, it was the big apple, ready for you to bite into, if you had the moxie...  so, naturally, the couple in this second coming find that moxie within themselves and finally join the fabulous fray to continue the american dream of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. hence, this movie is truly comic but not for reasons that the producers perhaps envisaged. as much as i like steve martin and goldie hawn in comedy, this movie is a travesty of the much better one made with the great jack lemmon. if you've seen the latter, then definitely don't bother with this one.",0
"this movie is practically impossible to describe. the alternate title ""don't look up"" is a lot more descriptive. like most japanese cinema, the story is not as linear as american. the story revolves around a director who is filming a story about a ww2 deserter. the set is haunted(?) by an actress who died(?) during the filming of a tv show back in the 60s. the director is the only one who saw this show. if you have seen ringu (the director hideo nakata is the same) and liked it, you'll like ghost actress. i loved ghost actress a lot more than ringu. a truly scary and disturbing movie. a 10!",1
"this was a great book and the possibilities for a truly great film were definitely there. but the casting decisions completely wrecked the movie. hanks is a great actor to be sure, but lacks the smarmy, morally ambivalent characteristics needed for the lead role. jeff daniels would have been my choice.  putting melanie griffiths in, for eye candy reasons, is understandable, but again, she did not portray the depth or ambivalence, so need to pull this off.  this movie is a great example of how every decision, even those early on in the movie production can make or break a file.",0
"my former cambridge contemporary simon heffer, today a writer and journalist, has put forward the theory that, just as british film-makers in the eighties were often critical of what they called ""thatcher's britain"", the ealing comedies were intended as satires on ""attlee's britain"", the britain which had come into being after the labour victory in the 1945 general election. this theory was presumably not intended to apply to, say, ""kind hearts and coronets"" (which is, if anything, a satire on the edwardian upper classes) or to ""the ladykillers"" or ""the lavender hill mob"", both of which may contain some satire but are not political in nature. it can, however, be applied to most of the other films in the series, especially ""passport to pimlico"".  pimlico is, or at least was in the forties, a predominantly working-class district of london, set on the north bank of the thames about a mile from victoria station. it is not quite correct to say, as has often been said, that the film is about pimlico ""declaring itself independent"" of britain. what happens is that an ancient charter comes to light proving that in the fifteenth century the area was ceded by king edward iv to the duchy of burgundy. this means that, technically, pimlico is an independent state, and has been for nearly five hundred years, irrespective of the wishes of its inhabitants. the government promise to pass a special act of parliament to rectify the anomaly, but until the act receives the royal assent the area remains outside the united kingdom and british laws do not apply.  because pimlico is not subject to british law, the landlord of the local pub is free to open whatever hours he chooses and local shopkeepers can sell whatever they please to whomever they please, unhindered by the rationing laws. when other traders start moving into the area to sell their goods in the streets, the british authorities are horrified by what they regard as legalised black-marketeering and seal off the area to try and force the ""burgundians"", as the people of pimlico have renamed themselves, to surrender.  many of the ealing comedies have as their central theme the idea of the little man taking on the system, either as an individual as happens in ""the man in the white suit"" or ""the lavender hill mob"", or as part of a larger community as happens in ""whisky galore"" or ""the titfield thunderbolt"". the central theme of ""passport"" is that of ordinary men and women taking on bureaucracy and government-imposed regulations which seemed to be an increasingly important feature of life in the britain of the forties. the film's particular target is the rationing system. during the war the system had been accepted by most people as a necessary sacrifice in the fight against nazism, but it became increasingly politically controversial when the government tried to retain it in peacetime. it was a major factor in the growing unpopularity of the attlee administration which had been elected with a large majority in 1945, and organisations such as the british housewives' league were set up to campaign for the abolition of rationing. i cannot agree with the reviewer who stated that the main targets of the film's satire were the ""spivs"" (black marketeers), who play a relatively minor part in the action, or the housewives' league, who do not appear at all. the satire is very much targeted at the bureaucrats, who are portrayed either as having a ""rules for rules' sake"" mentality or a desire to pass the buck and avoid having to take any action at all.  i suspect that if the film were to be made today it would have a different ending with pimlico remaining independent as a british version of monaco or san marino. (indeed, i suspect that today this concept would probably serve as the basis of a tv sitcom rather than a film). in 1949, however, four years after the end of the war, the film-makers were keen stress patriotism and british identity, so the film ends with pimlico being reabsorbed into britain. one of the best-known lines from the film is ""we always were english and we always will be english and it's just because we are english that we're sticking up for our right to be burgundians"". there is a sharp contrast between the rather heartless attitude of officialdom with the common sense, tolerance and good humour of the cockneys of pimlico, all of which are presented as being quintessentially british characteristics.  most of the action takes place during a summer drought and sweltering heatwave, but in the last scene, after pimlico has rejoined the uk the temperature drops and it starts to pour with rain. global warming may have altered things slightly, but for many years part of being british was the ability to hold the belief, whatever statistics might say to the contrary, that britain had an abnormally wet climate. the ability to make jokes about that climate was equally important.  there is a good performance from stanley holloway as arthur pemberton, the grocer and small-time local politician who becomes the prime minister of free pimlico, and an amusing cameo from margaret rutherford as a batty history professor. in the main, however, this is, appropriately enough for a film about a small community pulling together, an example of ensemble acting with no real star performances but with everyone making a contribution to an excellent film. it lacks the ill-will and rancour of many more recent satirical films, but its wit and satire are no less effective for all that. it remains one of the funniest satires on bureaucracy ever made and, with the possible exception of ""kind hearts and coronets"" is my personal favourite among the ealing comedies. 10/10",1

"my introduction into yoji yamada's cinematic world is through his famed and recent samurai trilogy with the twilight samurai, the hidden blade and love and honor. i had enjoyed all three films, and looking at the prolific, veteran director's filmography, i think it'll take me a very long while to watch all his films, especially the tora-san series. needless to say when kabei our mother has finally reached our shores, i jumped at the chance to watch what would be an ode to mothers everywhere, celebrating their innate love for their children.  based on the autobiography of teruyo nogami, kabei - our mother tells of a close knit family of four  mother kayo ""kabei"" (sayuri yoshinaga), father shigeru ""tobei"" (mitsugoro bando), eldest daughter hatsu (mirai shida) and youngest child teru (miku sato). from the get go their lives would be changed forever, when shigeru gets arrested under the peace preservation law for his morally controversial writings against the nation, set in the late 30s where japan had begun their ""crusade"" in china, and thereafter their participation in wwii.  so begins kabei's struggle to hold down jobs to feed her family, and the frequent, difficult meetings with her husband behind bars. help comes from relatives, especially on shigeru's side, since kabei's own dad had adopted an ""i told you so"" attitude with her choice of spouse. shigeru's one time student yama (arthouse buffs should recognize tadanobu asano here) provides laughter as a bumbling man who slowly becomes confidante and surrogate guardian to the children, and kabei's sister in law hisako (rei dan) from hiroshima, which i believe would have sounded some hindsight alarm bells as to her unfortunate fate as the film progresses through its timeline.  while the film centers primarily on how the kids are growing up under the presence of their mom, and in a distant relationship with their dad, what i enjoyed is how the microscopic family events unfold under the macroscopic worldwide events that have impacted on the common folk in japan. it's against the historical backdrop of japan's push to regional dominance, and there are characters here that don't mask those ambitions, even discussing what the country would eventually do should it be successful in holding onto conquered lands. this is something i rarely see in japanese films, being that frank in their discussion of that era, and also to get a glimpse of how the common man have to struggle against domestic issues made all the more difficult with resources channeled toward the war effort.  the actresses casted here are pitch perfect in their delivery and roles, be they the veterans or the child actors. actress sayuri yoshinaga deserves special mention for her role as the motherly figure who has to dig deep and find that inner strength to carry the household through under trying circumstances, while mirai shida and miku sato are lovable as the understanding children who have to learn to make do and compromise. each scene with the three of them together just makes it heart wrenching when the going gets tough, or fill your heart with joy should they be celebrating. before long you'll soon find yourself being attracted to want to be part of this family, thanks to the primary cast's powerful performances, with yoji yamada coaxing some really natural performances from the kids.  kabei - our mother boasts some stunningly beautiful art direction, and is classy in its delivery of both happy and sad moments without going over the top, or relying on cheap melodrama to cheapen the emotions it seeks from the audience. there are plenty of little things here done right which makes it pitch perfect, with every scene not being wasted, and with every nuance very meaningful in conveying its message across, be it compassion or love.  aside from the very abrupt ending (i had hoped that it could have continued for a lot more, despite its more than 2 hours runtime), kabei our mother comes highly recommended, and you'll find it difficult to be holding back either your tears, or that thought about your own mom and her sacrifices she makes for you on an everyday basis. just what those sacrifices are should you need another reminder, then the scene during the end credits roll will remind you of the stuff that you'd probably have taken for granted.",1
(spoilers)  i shoulda figured. the dvd didn't even show the time or how long it was. i thought wild cardz was the worst anime movie i'd ever seen. this one is much worse. makes no sense. thrown together plot. all so we can see oversized breasts on a figure that doesn't support them.   it had to of been a student film. that musta gotten a c grade  2/10  quality: 1/10 entertainment: 6/10 (until i found out it wasn't going to end.) the ending made no darn sense  replayable: 0/10,0
"the emotional impact of this movie defies words. it is elegant, subtle, beautiful, and tragic all rolled into two hours. this is will smith as he matures into his acting ability, the full range of it. who knew? i saw the pursuit of happiness and thought, this must be a fluke for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, smith. his performances in both movies portray a whole other dimension to smith, a refinement of talent, the selectivity of scripts, i'm not sure, but i view him differently now. seven pounds is one of those movies that in order to fully enjoy its essence you have to suspend your belief. don't watch it for the plot, watch it for the fragile condition of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. it is a story of human guilt, atonement, love, and sacrifice.",1
"i am usually disappointed by network movies. even flix that attract big name actors are usually ruined by the tv people. however, this one is the worst of the worst. the screenplay is weak and the acting, especially that of tracey pollan is abominable. i've trudged off to see my kids'high school plays and been treated to better acting. pollan acts as if she is reading the script as she speaks. when she tries to express fear, anger or grief, it's extremely hollow. because of the overall quality of the production i found it difficult to take it seriously. if you decide to brave this one just be prepared for a big disappointment. scary things won't scare you, sad things won't make you sad, romance won't make you feel warm and fuzzy and you will likely be as anxious as i was to see the end arrive. ""first to die"" says a lot about this movie.",0
"anyone who has read my review for uwe boll's ""alone in the dark"" will remember that i compared the unenviable task of sitting through that piece of human waste to having each and every hair on your arm pulled out. well, take that analogy a step further with this irredeemable gutter trash and try to imagine the pain of getting your teeth extracted without novacaine. do that, and you'll have a general idea of what eli roth's ""cabin fever"" is all about.  i never believed any one film was capable of topping the sheer agonizing dreck that uwe boll cranks out as the ""worst film ever made."" but, in all honesty, i have to say ""cabin fever"" comes very close. this is yet another sad excuse for a motion picture that had absolutely no valid reason to meet with any form of theatrical release. for somebody who claims to love the horror genre as much as eli roth does, he has created the single most annoying and convoluted patchwork of a movie i think i have ever seen in my entire life. how do you screw up a story like this? think of the potential this plot would have had without the poorly written characters, without the bad writing, and without all that unnecessary and unfunny comedy. a movie dealing with a grotesque flesh-eating virus could and should have been so much better than what roth dished out for us here. this script failed on so many levels with me. and, while i do not doubt the evident talent this director possesses, i do know that he fumbled the ball big time on an idea that could very well have redefined the horror genre.  to say this was a production of missed opportunities would indeed be a gross play on words. a generous amount of blood and unsettling special effects can't even save it, and that is one element i normally go for. there really was nothing about ""cabin fever"" that i could easily recommend to anybody. when three quarters of the crowd walks out of the theater halfway through, you know the movie is sinking fast. my best advice to those reading this would be to simply rent before purchasing. one viewing was more than enough for me to know that i will most likely never bother with it again.",0
"american icon henry fonda portrays ""elegant"" john howard, an aging trucker who has had his beloved big rig ""eleanor"" repossessed after a lengthy hospital stay has forced him to miss his payments. deciding that he would like to make just one more perfect run, he breaks out of the hospital, steals back eleanor, and hooks up with old friend penelope pearson (eileen brennan), who is in need of relocating her troupe of prostitutes.  fondas' wonderful performance is a natural anchor for a film that tugs at the heartstrings as effectively as it tickles the funny bone in the more comedic scenes. a superb cast including robert englund, as a reluctant young sidekick, susan sarandon (who also gets co-producer credit), and dub taylor (a delightful ham, as always, in the most blatantly comedic portion of the picture) helps immeasurably.  the ultimately life-affirming nature of the picture and the poignancy of the journey carry incredible weight; this is a picture, that provided you get into it, you can remember long after it's over.  the promise of the open road is vividly displayed here; the countryside just looks beautiful. set to craig safans' wonderful music score, it's a remarkable picture in terms of aesthetics.  it loses a little something in its final act (the characters played by john byner and austin pendleton are little more than intrusions), but it still maintains its good vibes thanks to the appeal of its central characters.  not at all the exploitation / drive-in schlock picture one might expect from the title (especially its alternate title, ""the great smokey roadblock""), it's a rewarding movie experience that i can recommend without qualms.  9/10",1
"when i saw the preview, i thought: this is going to be a great movie. and indeed it could have been. the actress playing the main character was very credible, and the beauty of the filming is undeniable. however the dialogues cast a dark shadow on the whole picture. the level of language was too familiar and too contemporary for an action taking place in 1610, and it took away most of the magic of the film. however, i must congratulate the translator, because the english sub-titles were more refined and appropriate that the original french cues, and it probably explains the good rating the movie received on the imbd!",0
i wouldn't rent this one even on dollar rental night.,0
"though i liked on the town better i really liked it. i'm a new comer when it comes to frank sinatra and gene kelly. though i had heard of them i had never seen anything with them in it until recently. the first one i saw was singin in the rain that made me a fan of gene's. i think that is better too. but i thought that this movie was good and like all movies there are some parts that are better than others but in my book it's an awesome movie and i love it. frank and gene make a good team. i have yet to see them together in take me out to the ballgame. but i'm sticking to my guns bu saying that i really enjoyed it, and that i love it!",1
"i read comments about this being the best chinese movie ever. perhaps if the only chinese movies you've seen contained no dialogue, long drawn-out far-away stares and silences, and hack editing, then you're spot on.  complicated story-line? hardly. try juvenile and amateurish. exquisite moods and haunting memories? hardly. try flat-out boring and trite.  this was awful. i could not wait for it to be over. particularly when the best lines in the movie consist of ""how are you? i'm fine. are you sure? yes."" wow! what depth of character. i guess the incessant cigarette smoking was supposed to speak for them.  as a huge fan of many chinese, japanese and korean films, i was totally disappointed in this. even zhang's sentimentally sappy ""the road home"" was better than this.",0
"i have always said that some plays by their very nature just can't be translated to film, and this one is a prime example.  as a play, this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church, with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners (one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not sinned since his last confession, so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven).  that's just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes, and in the make believe world of the theater, it works. however, that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film, and it certainly doesn't here.  director marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work, but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach.  seek out a production of the stage play instead, you won't be disappointed.",0
"the man in the moon is a warm and moving coming of age drama centering around a farming family in the 1950's. the main story follows a 14-year old girl (reese witherspoon) who develops a crush on a 17-year old neighbor (jason london) who ends up falling for her older sister (emily warfield) and how an unexpected tragedy alters this family's dynamics forever. the 1950's are lovingly evoked here and the screenplay gives you characters you come to care about almost immediately. witherspoon already begins to show the oscar-winning talent she would develop in this early role and london makes a charming leading man. warfield lends a quiet maturity to the role of the older sister that is effective as well. kudos to sam waterston and tess harper who play the girls' parents and gail strickland, who plays london's mom. i was unexpectedly moved by this quiet and affecting drama that stirs up strong emotions and gives deeper meaning to the phrase ""family ties.""",1
"evidently, not many people have seen this movie, because no one is posting any more comments. this is not a movie to be missed. after all, it has won the george peabody award as well as the humanitas award. paul winfield should have won an award for his awesome performance in this movie. eugene logan who was a co-writer on this made for tv movie also was part of another movie on humanity, or loss of it, by being a technical adviser to truman capote's movie the glass house. this movie is now available on dvd. if anyone is interested, i will post another letter telling how it was that eugene logan came to be the technical adviser to a movie of such an amazing person as truman capote. thanks for reading this and i hope you will find a way to view these two movies.",1
"fully deserving its prestigious hollywood award nomination, this is an entertaining little gem with lots of pizazz and some delightful surprises. outstandingly funny scenes include an hilarious shoot (and re-shoot) of a ww1 trench scene with australian comedian clyde cook as an optimistic non-com and the hapless mcdoakes as a boyer/colman messenger  all under the beady eye of ralph sanford's delightfully irascible anguish; a lost mcdoakes guided and re-guided by equally perplexed jack carson; assistant director chandler rejoicing in a mcdoakes-sent opportunity: ""i'm going to be a director!""   ace comic o'hanlon has a dual role, playing both mcdoakes and himself playing mcdoakes! oddly, richard l. bare who does play himself in one or more other entries in the series, has turned down that opportunity here. in real life, bare's a youngish, six-foot rock hudson lookalike, but here he's impersonated by veteran actor (over 500 movies!), jack mower.",1
"while i recently gave operation petticoat a positive review, i really didn't like this film even though it had so many similarities. both were made just a few years apart, both starred cary grant and both were wwii comedies. however, the overall tone and style of the films were quite different. kiss her for me, overall, just seemed like a cheaper film--with poor writing, little energy and some very broad performances--even when compared to operation petticoat. i think that at least much of the blame for this lies in casting jayne mansfield. the combination of her ample talents and limited acting ability really made this a-budget film look like it came from a 3rd rate studio. plus, there wasn't much chemistry or energy in pairing her with cary grant--an actor generally loved for his grace and class. it's sort of like pairing sir lawrence olivier with marjorie main.",0
"first of all.....  what the hell? why in the world are they trying to sell a low budget piece of crap on late night tv with the promise of disturbing, offensive sick garbage that any normal real human being with a soul couldn't watch.   what the crap is funny about a dog being injured, a grandma getting her head knocked off...a guy getting his hand blown to pieces and two girls going to the bathroom? what in the hell has this world come to that people find comedy in some thing so completely sick. anyone who thinks this kind of material is funny, should not even be allowed to walk the earth.   but from what i hear its not even offensive...so...they promise comedy through demented piles of sick garbage...and they cant even pull that off.",0
"originally aired as an abc movie of the week. this involves two young innocent female college students who are railroaded into a prison camp in a little southern town. they aren't allowed phone calls and nobody knows they're there. what follows is rape, torture, beatings, humiliation and degradation leading to a very disturbing conclusion.  the tv version was (for its time) grim. no nudity and the beatings were pretty tame but the overall feeling of sleaziness wore one down. the unrated version is even worse--there's plentiful nudity, the violence is extreme and, in one particularly disgusting sequence, we see a crying female prisoner forced to strip while a lesbian guard ""uses"" her. yuck! there's nothing wrong with exploitation films but this one just goes over the brink. you get the feeling that the filmmakers enjoy having these poor women being tortured and degraded--all this is shoved in your face like you're supposed to enjoy it. the needlessly downbeat ending doesn't help.  i'm giving it a 3 because the acting is good--but that actually makes the movie harder to watch. a sick, sleazy film. not recommended.",0
"this movie is a cringe-fest of bad acting and poor set design as well as tacky lines and a lame plot. but it is so much fun to watch. everything about it is hilarious.the basic plot is a group of scientists from the future travel back in time to capture their evil co-worker who is intent on destroying them all. they catch up with him in the year 1146. the 'futuristic' lab of the scientists from the year 2033 is an eighties-style room with a bunch of 'futuristic' flashing buttons and a time capsule that looks like a lawn shed. the actors deliver their lines with unenthusiastic aplomb, which isn't hard to understand considering that the lines are usually earth-shakers like "" i double-checked everything twice!"" he double checked everything twice? he checked it four times? not only that, but they feed you the entire premise of the movie in the first five minutes, and continue at a rapid fire pace until they hit the medieval part. when roger corman ran out of money. and had to stop travelling through time and consequently different sets. the medieval set is a comic mish-mash of anything from the late 10th century to the 16th century. any costume they could find, they used. i guess chain mail wasn't on the budget, 'cause the guys all wear sequined shirts masquerading as armor. the fight scenes are laughable, with men casually throwing themselves onto cardboard swords with abandon and dying in death throws with nary a blow cast.it sounds truly awful, but i enjoy it every time i watch it. the lines alone are enough to have you in fits and everything else pulls together to create a fabulous b-movie that, if you are a connoisseur of corny flicks, i would suggest you see. and once you have, read the review on unknown movies. i love hearing them point out all the funny, truly awful bits in the movie.",0
"there are 21 comments as i add mine to this list and there is barely a criticism. this is because this film is terrific entertainment and has a bit of everything in it.  it is perhaps a little frightening for younger children but my 15-year old son thought it was fantastic in every way from the action, to the humour and even to the beautiful music score.  i buy dvds only when i know that they are going to be regularly watched and now that this is finally available in the uk, i will certainly be adding it to my collection.",1
"for everyone who expects a traditional superhero-movie it might be an unpleasant surprise. it is definitely more of a drama rather than an action movie. it focuses mainly on emotions and it's a bit like a greek tragedy - whatever the main character does it always goes wrong somehow.  that's because sasha, like each superhero, takes the law into his own hands and the society doesn't appreciate it. sasha becomes an outlaw. while on the run, he meets a beautiful girl and falls in love so things get even more complicated for him.  as you can see, the plot itself is really dramatic but the movie lacks in dynamics. it reminds me slightly of the narration in the recent movies by ram gopal varma. everything happens very slowly. however, when there's an action scene it gets so immensely dynamic that before you realize what's going on, it's all over. but the director does not want to impress us with flashy and showy action. what is more important here is the outcome of sasha's actions, which are mostly very drastic. the score is very scarce, which also makes it more difficult to concentrate on the film. so basically you need to be very patient in order to watch it.  is the film worth it? that is a question really difficult to answer. i don't think that this experience enriched me so very much, but somehow i keep on thinking about this movie and feel like watching it again. mostly due to the atmosphere, which is really dense, but not suffocating because all the time sasha and katya have hope. after all they're young people, who have all their lives to live. so no matter how hard it gets there's always a slight joyous tune when they are together.",1
"well, jesus of montreal is basically an intelligent movie. the actors are indeed good and the technical side of the movie is okay. but, although i was very interested in the topic and like to think and discuss about religion (i am an atheist), it was hard to force myself to watch the movie to the bitter and in my opinion somehow unconsciously funny end. why is this movie so incredibly boring? i don't know. it just is and so it is not recommendable.",0
"i found the one and only comment about this movie entirely uninformative and altogether too harsh, so i have decided to write my own. i first saw this movie when it came out and have caught it a few times more since then. first of all let me say that, overall, the things that this movie gets right are what make it worthwhile. it doesn't matter that it has some low budget quirks and other faults. it is worth watching. the idea of basing a movie on walt whitman's visit a restrictive, narrow-minded anglo-canadian community in southern ontario and bringing people to life is a brilliant mis-en-scene. the movie is about the kind of humanizing catalysis whitman inspired in people. and in that sense it is exactly accurate. the acting - especially by rip torn (whitman) and colm feore as the doctor - is very good. the scripting and dialogue are strong and pay proper attention to the mores and inflections of the time. overall, what's not to like? besides, name another film in which whitman is brought so vividly to life?",1
"shortly after seeing this film i questioned the mental competence of every actor and actress that accepted a role. elizabeth shue is a commendable actress, why would she embrace such an overrated opportunity? i must give credit where credit is due, though. some moments in the movie were unpredictable and rather transfixing, but they hardly made up for the scathing perverse tendencies of kevin bacon's character, sebastian caine. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, man or woman, that has any form of self-respect to account for.",0
"uc 0079, the one year war is almost at an end. a neutral colony of side 6 has been targeted by cyclops, a zeon task force. their target, a new gundam being built exclusively for newtypes (supposedly built for amuro ray from the original gundam saga) inside. when little boy al izuruha, a fan of zeon ms, encounters a zaku after battle breaks out in the colony, he befriends newbie ms pilot benard ""bernie"" wiseman. the two become good friends, al is treated as an honorary member of the cyclops team. through the show, bernie acts as a father figure to al (whose real father is always working) and seems to be taken with federation pilot christina mckenzie, but eventually they must meet....in battle. al soon learns that war is not child's play and bernie must choose to make the ultimate sacrifice to complete his mission.  for only 6 episodes, gundam 0080 is a well done show. the mobile suits are extremely well designed, and the animation may look dated but really shows emotion in the characters. if you liked 0083 then check this one out, or if you are new to the gundam world, this is a good show to start with. if you look to a show for drama and character development, this is the one for you, it focuses more on that then mobile suit battle. i would rate it more of a drama than action.  mobile suit gundam 0080, war in the pocket.   sometimes you have to lose to win.",1

"this is a rip-roaring british comedy movie and one that i could watch over and over again without growing tired. peter ustinov has never performed in a bad role and this is no exception, particularly with his dry wit but very clever master plan. karl malden has always been an admirer of mine since he starred in 'streets of san francisco'. i believe that maggie smith is the real star of this film though, appearing to be so inept at everything she tries to do but in truth is so switched on, particularly at the end when she informs everyone that she has invested so much money that she has discovered whilst laundering his clothes. one thing does concern me though, could someone please tell me why i cannot purchase this on either dvd or vhs format in the uk, could someone please assist?",1

"this movie was just as good as some of the other westerns made by anthony mann and james stewart like winchester '73 and the naked spur, and much better than thunder bay and bend of the river. this film starts out like a run of the mill western but gets more complex as it goes along. it starts out with jimmy stewart and walter brennan arriving in seattle and stewart is charged with murder. he is found innocent but is cattle is stolen by a corrupt judge. stewart then agrees to lead something but i forget what it is but stewart only cares about getting his cattle back. as the movie goes along it's like stewart only cares about himself just like his character in the naked spur. it gets much better at the halfway point after they arrive in alaska. this is one of stewart's better westerns.",1
"yes i'll say before i start commenting, this movie is incredibly underrated.  sharon stone is great in her role of catherine trammell as is morrissey as dr glass. he is an analyst sent in to evaluate her after the death of a sports star. glass is drawn into a seductive game that trammel uses to manipulate his mind.  the acting was good (apart from thewlis)  stone really has a talent with this role. she's slick, naughty and seductive and doesn't look a day older than she did in the first.she really impressed me(like in casino). morrisey was also good. he showed much vunerablitity in a role that needed it. thewlis however was lame. he ruined his character and was over-the-top the whole way. he really sucked.  overall, this movie not as good the first but stone is a hoot to watch. just ignore thewlis.",1

"after several extremely well ratings to the point of superb, i was extremely pleased with the film. the film was dark, moving, the anger, the pain, the guilt and a very extremely convincing demon.  i had initially expected to see many special effects, and like a lover's caress, it blew me away with the subtlety and the rightness of it. brian, i am again blown away with your artistry with the telling of the story and your care of the special effects. you will go a long way, my friend. i will definitely be the president of your fan club.  eric etebari, the best actor award, was the number one choice. you made jr. lopez look like a child compared to kasadya. :)   overall, the acting, story line, the high quality filming and awesome effects, it was fantastic. i just wish it were longer. i am looking forward to the dreamless with extremely high expectations.",1
"i also saw this amazingly bad piece of ""anime"" at the london sci-fi festival. if you have to watch this thing, do so with a large audience preferably after a few beers, you may then glean some enjoyment from it.   i found the dialogue hilarious, lodged in my mind is the introduction of cremator. the animation is awful. it is badly designed and badly executed. it may have been a good idea for the producers to have hired at least one person who was not colour blind.  there's nothing else to say really, this film is a failure on every level.",0
"eric clapton, jack bruce and ginger baker re-unite to play all their songs from 35 years ago when they formed a trio called ""cream."" those were the psychedelic days of england and america and these guys looked it: all skinny, very long hair, wild clothes and loud music. they played a combination of rock and blues and it was, for the most part, good stuff.  well, these guys are now 60-something years old and they can still sing and play at a high level as this wonderful dvd concert disc shows us. i was always extremely familiar with clapton, of course, who has never been out of the limelight, but i didn't know what to expect from bruce and baker, neither of whom i hadn't seen in decades. they surprised me. when he was young, baker was so gaunt he looked like a speed freak near death. now he looks healthy, in shape and his drum playing was solid. bruce looked a bit haggard but his voice is great, as good as ever and a pleasure to hear on these old songs. this is just excellent material and performing from guys who know what they're doing.  some people criticized this show for being low-key. i don't agree with that. i have no complaints. the concert sounded very good. the second song, ""spoonful,"" was outstanding, the highlight of the concert for me.  highly recommended.",1

"first off, if you're planning on watching this, make sure to watch the uncut version (although it is very interesting to go back and then watch the scenes that were tampered with due to censorship), it makes a huge difference. this film is about a young woman, played by barbara stanwyck, who since the age of 14 has been forced into prostitution by her own father. when her father suddenly passes away, she is able to go out into the world on her own. after reading about nietzsche's philosophies on life, she uses her sexuality to manipulate men into giving her what she wants and leaves them in ruins and desperate for her love. throughout the movie she becomes increasingly materialistic and manipulative and the audience begins to wonder is she has any sense of morality left at all. overall, baby face is a very shocking movie with blatant scenes of sexuality that most people would not expect to see in a black and white film. while no sexual acts are explicitly shown on screen, it is very obvious what is happening off camera.  i enjoyed watching this film very much and i believe most modern audiences will get at least some enjoyment out if it, especially with the films shock value. i did think while watching it that the pacing seemed a bit slow at parts, but i think that about most movies the first time is see them. actually, i think that almost all movies i've seen made from the early 30's had some minor pacing problems or certain parts just didn't quite ""flow"" right. this was probably just the craft of film-making wasn't quite perfected yet  it would take just a few more years. compare a film from 1939 and compare it with an early 30's film and i think you'll see what i mean.  once again, i'm very glad i was able to watch the original cut; it really does make a big difference. also any john wayne fans will be surprised to see him in this movie before he was famous in an uncharacteristic role.",1
"critics need to review what they class as a quality movie. i think the critics have seen too many actions films and have succumbed to the matrix style of films. europa is a breath of fresh air, a film with so many layers that one viewing is not enough to understand or appreciate this outstanding film. lars von trier shows that old styles of filming can produce marvellous cinema and build drama and tension. the back projection effect he uses during the film arouses and enhances the characters, and the focus of the conversation they are having. other effects he uses such as the colour and black and white in one scene much like hitchcock and the girl with the red coat grabs attention and enhances the drama and meaning of the scene. the commentary is superb and has a hypnotic effect, again maintaining the focus on the central characters in the scene and there actions.  i could talk about the effects more but i think you all would agree they push this film into a category of its own, and really heighten the drama of the film. a film to buy if you don't own already and one to see if you have not.  10/10 don't miss this artistic noir film from one of the great film directors.",1
"one reviewer notes that it does not seem to matter what welles actually says or does, he moves you. i concur. he was and remains a unique force in film. more than a triple threat who could act, write and direct, he had a genius uniquely suited to film. one can consider whether in an earlier age he would have been a painter. this film certainly reinforces that impression. a musician, a theatre actor, an heir to shakespeare? hard to tell but i am very grateful that his time cam with film and he have him captured on film. i like the accent. i like the face, the size, the style, the mind and the games. i love all of his movies and wish there were more. i particularly love how other actors interacted with him on film. many were never better or at least somehow different with him because he was o firmly there. even towards the end when his beauty was ruined, perhaps by his own intent, he was impossible to ignore and he made every scene he was in. rita was a gorgeous blonde -- a lana turner look alike but perhaps even lovelier and even then the eye goes to welles and one wishes for another minute, another film, another hour in his company. that is why we all wish we could come upon the lost scraps cut from his films because we know, we all know, that there is not part of him not worthy of our time. watch it and be grateful for the chance.",1
!!!!! of course there's spoilers !!!!! i'm sure this project started off as a screen writing workshop on avoiding clichés in horror movies: female protagonist - check bad things happen to drug takers - check heorine knocks out villain - check heroine doesn't notice villain recovering unconsciousness - check frame the sequence so we see recovered villain creep up behind heroine - check unfortunately it seems someone has sent this cliché list to a film studio instead of using it for class . dear oh dear if only london transport was as regular as the clichés turning up here . in fact there's so many clichés and seen it all before moments that no one actually thought about going into detail as to what the eponymous creep is or how long he's been killing people on the underground . i'm led to believe it's the result of some human experiment and perhaps it's not until that night he decided to take his revenge out on humanity but all this is so vague as to be meaningless not to be totally negative i doubt very much if the producers thought they'd be making a film that was going to sweep the oscars that year and there's always a market for horror movies . likewise i doubt if it cost too much produce and had one eye on the dvd market rather than cinema distribution and i will state that it's slightly better than 1972's death line which also featured a murderous cannibal hiding in the london underground . it's just that when you think all the clichés have been used up in this film another cliché comes along to raise its ugly head,0
"excruciatingly slow-paced, over-scripted black comedy with a too-clever premise and bad acting.  maybe this would have worked as a twilight zone or tales from the crypt episode, but by the last half, you just want it to get to its predictable ending and be done with it already.",0
"i am a kind person, so i gave this movie a 2 instead of a 1. it was without a doubt the worst movie that i've seen in a long time. there was very little plot and the deeper interesting areas that were touched upon i.e. what jesus may really have wanted us to know, were glossed over and instead we were given heavy visual doses of sadistic punishment inflicted upon our heroine (arquette). total crucifixion in the first 15 minutes would have been more humane to both her character and the audience. the acting was barely there and the direction was uninspired. and, if i saw one more drip of water or dove flying toward the camera, i may have started screaming louder than patricia.",0
"finally! an iranian film that is not made by majidi, kiarostami or the makhmalbafs. this is a non-documentary, an entertaining black comedy with subversive young girls subtly kicking the 'system' in its ass. it's all about football and its funny, its really funny. the director says ""the places are real, the event is real, and so are the characters and the extras. this is why i purposely chose not to use professional actors, as their presence would have introduced a notion of falseness."" the non-actors will have you rooting for them straightaway unless a. your heart is made of stone b. you are blind. excellently scripted, the film challenges patriarchal authority with an almost absurd freshness. it has won the jury grand prize, berlin, 2006. dear reader, it's near-perfect. where, where can i get hold of it?",1
"this movie was so ridiculous i never even finished watching it i actually thought someone had made their own version and dubbed it onto the dvd from the movie store. this movie made me sick not because it was gory, but because i wasted 2 50 on it!!!! it looks like my brother and i went into a house and made the movie ourselves and edited slaughterhouse footage into it! i am so ticked off, even the btk killer deserves more credit than that it was not even accurate i mean come on the cow head was obviously made out of play dough or bubble gum omg i cant even get all the words out to explain it do not watch this movie!!!!!!!",0
"### spoilers! ###   what is this movie offering? out of control editing and cinematography that matches up with a terrible plot. it is sad to see denzel washington's talents go wasted in trashes like this.we are certainly hinted how the mexicans cannot save themselves, outside forces needed, possibly militaristic, american ones. and we know the father is a shady character, he is a mexican after all, unlike the wife who appreciates creasey more because he is american. he killed all of them thinking she died. and did she? of course, she won't, she is a young kid and you are not supposed to hurt the sensibilities of the hollywood fan. the trade off scene was the only thing that prevents me from rating it below the ""implausibly successful""(as some critic pointed out)'taken'. the nausea of such movies will take time to go. it is in the rating of such movies that we have to doubt imdb's credulity.7.7 for a movie like this and 7.0 for my own private idaho. go figure! mine will be in the range of 3.5-4.0",0
"this film was horrible. the script is completely unrealistic yet it is written to take place in the real-world, the editing and lighting effects are worse than most first projects in film school.  i do not recommend this film to anyone who: a) knows any detail about the world of police or covert operations. b) knows any detail about film making or appreciation.  i do recommend this film to the average or below-average mind, i think it would be enjoyable if i was a dumber. if you must watch this film on a full mind, i highly recommend some kind of inebriation  it is a total waste of what little production value it has.",0
"somehow a woman working with a scientist puts round metal balls into people's mouths that supposedly changes their personality but in reality turns them into crazed, zombie-like killers. the ""guinea pigs"" for the experiment are scantily-clad, nubile young women in desperate need of acting lessons. this movie is awful, atrocious, and amazingly bad. it has little to no logic in the script. you really will have trouble following what is going on. it has no special effects. the computer screen that is supposedly representing a huge scientific advancement looks nothing more than an old atari screen. and what is even worse is that there is also a puppet with strands of felt hair(looks like a lonely kid at summer camp made it) named george that is like a personal servant/confidant to jessica(the leading ""actress""). throughout the movie you will be subjected to the idiotic, sophmoric utterings of this puppet. but wait...you also get loads of softcore, unerotic, barely nude scenes with the girls with some bar guys. all the while a most annoying soundtrack plays in the background like some kind of spiritual discovery has taken place. none of the actors are good. there are just varying degrees of bad. the gore and ""horror"" aspects are especially ineptly filmed. the film really looks like an adolescent put it together. no coincidence henry sala, the director by name but not by trade, has not made another film. i was bored almost into a coma watching this stupid, silly, dreck! and how bout the ending? what happened? if you know let me in on the secret because for the life of me i cannot figure it out. all i know is that i lost the time spent watching this garbage that made the beginning of my weekend a real nightmare of a bore!",0
"a documentarist, like any filmmaker, must convey a compelling story. will pascoe fails utterly in this effort, cobbling together uninspired snippets of chomsky's wisdom from a visit to mcmaster university in hamilton. the footage is shot amateurishly and in video. pascoe's only effort at cohering the fragments into a whole is by periodically throwing a vague title on the screen: ""9-11,"" ""activism,"" ""truth.""  lame.  compare this with documentaries like ""the corporation"" or ""the fog of war"" which create a narrative drawing material from interviews, stock footage, and filmed footage. in the end each delivers a poignant and insightful message deftly and intelligently.  the only saving graces of the film are chomsky's nonchalantly delivered upendings of historical dogma, and the fact that the running time is only 74 minutes.  one of the more interesting passages was chomsky's recounting of his experience with national public radio. he describes the conservative media as more accommodating to dissenting views, while npr's liberal dogma strait-jackets its interviewees and dramatically limits its permitted messages. yet another media outlet to be skeptical of.  this documentary is for noam chomsky completists only.",0

"normally, i am a pretty generous critic, but in the case of this film i have to say it was incredibly bad. i am stunned by how positive most reviews seem to be.  there were some gorgeous shots, but it's too bad they were wasted on this sinkhole of a movie. it might have worked if ""daggers"" was purely an action flick and not a romance, but unfortunately the film is built around an empty love triangle. there is no chemistry between either of the couples, whatever exists between mei and her men seems to be more lust than love, and for the most part the dialogue is just silly. this may be just a problem with translation, but the frequent usage of the word ""flirt"" in particular reminded me of 8th grade, not head-over-heels, together forever, worth-dying-for love; i also felt we were beat over the head with the wind metaphor. the audience is given very little about the characters to really care about, and therefore very little emotional investment in the movie as a whole. i was wishing for a remote control to fast forward, i was slumped in my seat ready to snore, but mostly i just cringed a lot.  *******spoiler*****  now, the icing on the cake. or rather, adding insult to injury. the ending was truly one of the most horrible, laughable ones i have ever seen. the boys are having their stag fight and screaming and yelling and hacking at each other. oh, and then it starts to snow. randomly. oh, and then mei (dagger embedded in heart) suddenly pops up out of the weeds. then she throws a dagger that seems to take about 5 minutes to reach it's destination, even slowing conveniently midscreen to hit a tiny blood droplet. wow, cool.  well, then mei dies finally i guess because she threw the dagger that was lodged in her chest and bled to death. jin sings, sobs, holds her body close, screen goes blank. i, and the people surrounding me, are chuckling. not a good sign.  visually stunning, but ultimately a failure.",0
"last year we were treated to two movies about truman capote writing the book from which this film was made - capote and infamous.  i cannot imagine a movie like this being made in 1967. a stark, powerful and chillingly brutal drama; elevated to the status of a film classic by the masterful direction of richard brooks (elmer gantry, cat on a hot tin roof, the professional, blackboard jungle).  it is interesting that robert blake, who starred in this film, has had so many problems of late that may be related to his portrayal of a killer in this film.  this is a film that stays with you after viewing.",1
"worry not, disney fans--this special edition dvd of the beloved cinderella won't turn into a pumpkin at the strike of midnight. one of the most enduring animated films of all time, the disney-fide adaptation of the gory brothers grimm fairy tale became a classic in its own right, thanks to some memorable tunes (including ""a dream is a wish your heart makes,"" ""bibbidi-bobbidi-boo,"" and the title song) and some endearingly cute comic relief. the famous slipper (click for larger image) we all know the story--the wicked stepmother and stepsisters simply won't have it, this uppity cinderella thinking she's going to a ball designed to find the handsome prince an appropriate sweetheart, but perseverance, animal buddies, and a well-timed entrance by a fairy godmother make sure things turn out all right. there are a few striking sequences of pure animation--for example, cinderella is reflected in bubbles drifting through the air--and the design is rich and evocative throughout. it's a simple story padded here agreeably with comic business, particularly cinderella's rodent pals (dressed up conspicuously like the dwarf sidekicks of another famous disney heroine) and their misadventures with a wretched cat named lucifer. there's also much harrumphing and exposition spouting by the king and the grand duke. it's a much simpler and more graceful work than the more frenetically paced animated films of today, which makes it simultaneously quaint and highly gratifying.",1
"this is some of the worst acting i have ever seen. i love almereyda's nadja, but this is just absolute dreck. aside from a few moments of interesting cinematography and music this film is just nonstop bad acting and dumb material. jared harris is particularly bad, but no one in this is remotely good. the plot is a joke, but not the haha kind. i don't even know if you can forgive movies that are this bad. please erase the last hour and a half of my life. how did this director make nadja and another girl another planet?",0
"as part of the celebration of the release of casino royale, this film with the new bond starring in it was shown, from director roger michell (notting hill). i almost turned it off for being a bit boring, but i'm glad i stuck with it. basically may (anne reid) is a single mother of helen (anna wilson-jones) who hardly sees anyone and has not had a boyfriend in years. her daughter says that she might want to get married to her new boyfriend, darren (daniel craig, of course). after knowing each other only a few days, may and darren have a secret affair. and at her age, with a 30-something, and the new bond?! anyway, they obviously want to keep it a secret, but may has regrets and wonders if helen will find out. when she does, darren gets less hassle than may. in fact, helen asks her permission to hit her. also starring peter vaughan as toots, danira govich as au pair, harry michell as harry, rosie michell as rosie and johnny english's oliver ford davies as bruce. very good!",1
indian cinema typifies cops of two broad categories: they are either the honest type or the bad guys. the honest guys always shout at the top of their voice and fight the system while the bad cops enjoy for most part but suffer at the end.  this movie at least breaks this usual formula and gives a refreshing view of cops and their lives. the direction takes an inside look at the life of a young ambitious cop who. the music is interesting and the editing is a trend setter as far as indian cinema goes.  the movie is slow at times and the dilemma which anbu faces when it comes to maya is overplayed at times. but i would still give this one 9/10 simply because it has many firsts to its credit.,1
"if.... is the cinematic equivalent of sgt. pepper's: revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation, and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations. now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet, and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books/films, the relevance of if.... couldn't be further from modern concern. in fact, many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd's the wall.  one should never hold personal bias against a film while reviewing, and the cemented date of this film aside, there are a few flaws which others have overlooked. lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buñuel, on top of generally being too smart for his own good. and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts, the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism. anderson wasn't capable of this feat due to his over-intelligent cynicism, failing to see that buñuel was jovial in his work. i have not found a critic whom champions the 'chaplain in a drawer', and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film. the ending is not so much a concise punch to the established class/values system, as a wet slap on a moving target.  the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes (the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors). and the modus operandi of if.... was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film, thereby savaging middle class pretense. homosexuality, generational cutlery, cold showers et al. in reality, such issues had been covered in many other great british films, if.... merely brought them to the fore. the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp, to name but one.  if.... is oddly quaint, and simply can not be viewed with modern (especially american) eyes. kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant, and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones. points deducted for pretension, establishing characters who disappear, and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught.",0
"pendragon pictures' new film ""h g wells' war of the worlds"", the first faithful adaptation of the original novel, has been in development for about 5 years. a theatrical release was intended for earlier this year (march, 2005) but this never happened. the dvd was rushed out to coincide with the release of spielberg's version, which hits theatres june 29.  i liked this film, with certain reservations.  how faithful is the adaptation? it's not quite 100% faithful to wells' book, but 90 - 95% faithful is good enough for me. at least several scenes were totally new, such as ogilvy the astronomer's confrontation with a farmer, and the unnamed writer/narrator awkwardly having tea with his cousin. but on the whole, this film follows the book very closely -- certainly much more than the classic 1953 version by george pal.  its greatest fault is that it was obviously made on a very cheap budget. the majority of it seems to have been shot blue-screen and composited with digitally rendered backgrounds. this is particularly annoying during most of the interior shots, and scenes of crowded city streets. the overviews of 1898 london look like something from a video game. numerous scenes in horse-carriages were faked -- i guess they couldn't afford to rent a horse. the only scenes shot for ""real"" seem to be those in open fields or forests.  but within those budget restrictions, they managed to do quite a lot. artistically, the film looks right. the martians and their tripods are quite well done, and very true to wells' descriptions. i was particularly impressed with the heat ray. although the thunder child sequence, which should have been one of the film's highlights, is very disappointing. it's a great shame that they couldn't afford more actual sets, or better quality animation.  the acting and direction won't win any oscars. for the most part, they are competent, not bad, but not outstanding. the music is quite good also, though not on a par with any of the major hollywood composers.  i'm actually glad this didn't get a theatrical release, because the budget limitation would have made it look much worse on a big screen. as it stands, i would rate this similarly to a bbc-tv adaptation of classic literature.  a few nitpicks: most of the scenes are presented with various colored filters (mostly red). this may have been an artistic choice, but it is used very inconsistently, and seems more like a sloppy job of mastering the dvd. and the writer/narrator's obviously fake moustache mutates from scene to scene.  bottom line -- is it worth seeing? if you can look past the technical and budgetary limitations, and get into the story, i think you will enjoy this, especially if you've actually read the original h g wells novel. if, however, you are easily put off by cheap production values, you'd best pass on this (unless you're a mst3k fan). be warned, however that the film runs a full 3 hours, so i don't recommend watching it all in one sitting.  btw: an entirely different version of war of the worlds (aka ""invasion"") came out on dvd the same month that spielberg's hit the theatres: http://imdb.com/title/tt0449040/. this was also made on a budget, but is updated to the present day like the spielberg film - but it's much better! and to top it off, jeff wayne is making an animated film of his best-selling album from 1978, but that won't be out until 2007.",1
"""the good earth"" is a great movie that you don't hear much about anymore. there are a lot of big disasters and events, but it is also a non-passionate love story. all of this happens in a little over two hours, which is short by today's standards. the special effects and costumes are very good for the time period.  i am surprised that luise rainer received an oscar for such a limiting role. she basically only has three emotions: submissive, hungry, and heart-broken.  the performances by the asian and asian-american actors are terrific.

"i don't believe they made this film. completely unnecessary. the first film was okay. but there was no need for a sequel, certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film. this film feels like a soap-opera. the writing is so bad, it's utterly simple. the jokes don't come across, the acting is flat, it's shot like a soap, it lacks any direction. the first film had a good emotional spine behind it. every character had a little arc. it was very simple then but somehow it worked and i could see the merit of that film. but this time around, there is no cohesive story-line. the characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens. one good thing: the brazilian boy who plays axel daeseleire's son is pretty well cast. that was their one moment of creative success on this film. i hear they already shot a second television series as a sequel to 'team spirit 2' but please god, don't let them make a third feature installment...",0
"the summer has been so full of blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that i was woe to find a film i could just sit down and enjoy.   in case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), i'll sum it up here: it's more mature than ella enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds. think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical princess bride, and you'll be close.   -------------------------------------------------------------  i am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others... maybe once or twice a month, if i feel active. i'm also a huge sci-fi/fantasy fan. i get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.  by the end here (august), i was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that i averted seeing bourne ultimatum in favor of stardust. having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by transformers for my fiction addiction, the previews of stardust seemed appealing, but i was certainly wary.  as many others here, i was utterly surprised. i had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast. don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief... but the most refreshing thing i found, is that it's not based on anything i've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.  ((unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that hollywood is running out of ideas? i could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another ""epic fantasy tale, the likes of lotr and the rest"" so says the nyt and such and such no doubt.))  stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was i sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. it didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (transformers, i'm looking at you). it's not trying to show off the latest cgi techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough i could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy i hate those).   i just... watched. watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly creative storyline unfold before my eyes. sure, i may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that. it even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect i noticed is that i left the theater feeling better than when i'd gone in.  it truly is a gem. after so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work i'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.  it's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; if you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (princess bride, black cauldron, the dark crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. this little diamond is finding its way into my dvd collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.  simply wonderful.",1
"the dukes of hazzard is quite an achievement  a $53m film that's worse than any given episode of a downmarket 25-year old tv show. the plot is serviceable enough but the mindless fun is rarely to be found and the casting is pretty atrocious: johnny knoxville is more passenger than protagonist, m.c. gainey's sheriff roscoe is a bland thug, michael weston's enos tiresome, a seemingly ideally-cast willie nelson just seems to be waiting for the check to clear and burt reynolds, stuck in some purgatory where he's doomed to relive his old movies as a bit player, is a curious choice for boss hogg to say the least but does have one good moment with a heckler and a hundred dollar bill. you know a film is in trouble when seann william scott and jessica simpson are the most charismatic screen presences but worse than the script or the casting is jay chandrasekhar's hopeless direction: seemingly born with no conception of comic timing, unable to do much more than basic two-shots and seemingly clueless as to how to shoot a car chase let alone the couple of decent stunts in the film, he seems determined to sap the film of any signs of life before they materialise. there are a couple of neat post-modern moments revolving around the confederate flag and daisy's stereotypical role in every episode, but no film that makes you pine for the days when hal needham was directing this sort of thing (and badly) can be a good thing.",0

"kareena kapoor in a bikini hmmmmmmmm.  akshay kumar...  anil kapoor....  maybe saif....  kareena kapoor in a bikini.....  good banner..  kareena kapoor in a bikini.....  not one good reason not to see this movie....  or so i thought ........didnt these people make jbj...  why o why did i forget that.  for all the criticism the first half of the movie isn't that bad...  there is some intrigue and you feel a sort of irritation mixed with excitement that i felt when seeing guy ritchie movies like lock stock and snatch.  kareena kapoor is sizzling in a very skinny model sort of way.  akshay kumar is akshay kumar as only he can be.  anil kapoor is annoying but kind of funny, you almost forget that most of the time you cannot understand him.  saif is sidey ala main khiladi.. once again.  there is the occasional laugh and a few chuckles, and a few goosebumps during the kareena-saif love story (kareena in the rain, behind me on my bike hmmmmmmm).  but mostly this half promises more than it delivers.....  which makes the second half all the more unbearable....  there was almost a cheer when the interval came not only because because of the wet kareena because of what people thought were the things to come.  instead we were treated to mind numbing torture which is difficult to put in words.  saif suddenly seam like a comic sidekick...  suddenly the sexy kareena looks anorexic, you realise that the second last floor is now empty and her face looks to big for her body ( only girls can notice this and make other guys notice the second last floor was my observation).  anil kapoor and his sidekicks get on your nerves.  akshay kumar is the only one who carries off the madness to some extent but even he become intolerable after a while.  all the while you are subjected to one absurdity after the other.  why??!! what??!!! when?!!! where?!!! what have i done to deserve this...  a collective gasp went trough the audience before every song in the second half, which were ordinary even without the movie around it.  cannot relieve the trauma anymore....  conclusion.  this movie starts of as a buzz which you feel could even turn out to a high but ends up slowly moving towards a headache and then rapidly turns into a full blown migraine attack.  please don't watch this movie for any reason other than academic interest.  +s cast, akshay kumar, first half.  +/-s what, when, how, who to much confusion.(need a book to fill this).  +s cast, the whole second half (need many pages to fill this).  total 3/10 (im trying to avoid the 1s and 2s too not seem to extreme but make no mistake this movie is unwatchable no matter how decent the first half is).",0
"having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 christmases, i feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of dr. seuss' classic tale, and well... it's not very good. first off, following a classic act like chuck jones' animated tv special is going to be difficult for anyone, but this interpretation is so heavy-handed and padded as to be positively numbing. i will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags, but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab, at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of christmas. jim carrey is typically over the top here, but that is completely at odds with the character of the grinch. as characterised by boris karloff, he was a slow burn; methodical and sly. there is no method to carrey's madness, and that is only the most obvious error made. talented actors like jeffrey tambor and christine baranski are utterly wasted here. why, universal, why? i mean , i understand that tony hopkins will take just about any role offered (much like his countryman michael caine), but this one needs to be filed under ""films that should never have been made."" this does not bode well for the cat in the hat, an even thinner tome that universal is prepping for this christmas. i get the feeling that i will be making the same recommendation for that one as i am with this one: skip it, and either read the book or watch the tv special. this is 2 hours you can never, ever get back.",0
"good western filmed in the rocky arizona wilds. lots of tough guys throughout; cobern's character seemed to rock back and forth between a raging psycho and a laid back type. several holes appeared in the picture, but not enough to offset it being exciting and worth seeing. one really dumb scene shows heston emptying .45 cases of their powder and collecting it in a sack for the purpose of starting a fire. a. to gather that much gunpowder he would have needed a pack mule to carry the ammo. b. the grass was obviously dry: why not just drop a match on it and let 'er rip?",1
"humphrey bogart clearly did not want to be in this film, and be forced to play a part-mexican or he would have been suspended. believe me , he made the wrong choice! presumably, after the success of ""dodge city"", warners tried a follow-up with errol flynn and his usual list of buddies, like alan hale, guinn (big boy) williams, frank mc hugh and the ever-present john litel, but they made the huge mistake of trying to present miriam hopkins as a love interest for flynn v. randolph scott, and as a singer to really make things bad, because she proved one thing, and that is she cannot sing. the story was not too bad, but with bogie clearly miscast also, it turned out to be a poor western that was overlong, and on a low budget, but in fairness, color would not have helped.",0
"spoiler!!! this movie is based on the concept of what if? of course mr destiny will be able to answer this question. the main character goes through a bad day, like many of us, and asks this question. chaos theory states a butterfly in china could have an effect on someone over here from a chain reaction. the focus of this movie is based on one event during a baseball game. this event sets into motion one's destiny; just like ashton in ""the butterfly effect"" except mr. destiny uses comedy over drama. the results make a fresh, somewhat original movie. if one's philosophical are in tune with ""the butterfly effect"" one will likely enjoy mr. destiny. i give it a 7 out of 10. amazing for i have seen the first half of this movie 3 times, and finally watched the ending on tbs.",1
"i run a group to stop comedian exploitation and i just spent the past 2 months hearing horror stories from comedians who attempted to audition for, ""last comic standing."" if they don't have a good agent, then they don't even get a chance to audition so more than 80% of the comedians who turn up are rejected before they can show anyone that they have talent! if they do make it to an audition, i was told that it's ""pre-determined"" if they get a second chance. so what the tv audience sees is not the best comics in the us.  if the comics do make it to the show, then most of them don't get imdb credits. i know this because i did the credits for all 6 seasons of, ""last comic standing"" and i don't get paid for doing the producers' job. it's really a disgrace. a month ago, i asked, ""last comic standing 7"" on facebook why the producers aren't giving imdb credits and i was banned from their facebook page!!! i am not a comedian so i do not have a personal stake in this. i just want people to know the truth. i don't like seeing anyone getting exploited and that's why i've been helping the comedians. comedians get exploited on hbo, bet, tvone and other cable networks but nbc is a big three network so those in charge should be ashamed of themselves for allowing this exploitation to happen.  please watch this video of a comedian who was victimized: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmb4-hyet_y",0
"i don't think most people give this movie as much credit as it deserves. i love low budget horror movies and this takes the cake, especially for originality. yes the scarecrow is a kung-fu fighting frightner, but why not? no one else is willing to go that far. i really haven't had this much fun watching a movie since candyman. so the town picks on this one kid calling him scarecrow, even his mom doesn't care about him. then he gets killed and the spirit is infused with in the scarecrow, who then goes on a killing spree. his demise is relatively easy to assume once the movie gets going. the dedications at the end go straight to a bunch of horror directors, but with most dedication towards dario argento really struck me as cool, these folks who wanna make movies of a newer genre. over the movie has a lot of arnold rip offs, with one liners you'll definitely laugh at like stick around and he kills the sheriff with a stick. i would say, grab a pizza some friends an laugh your a$$ off with this movie. i love it for its originality, most fun.",1
"i watched phat beach on cable for a while and i sort of enjoyed it. the fat guy is the best character, as he seems to be a nice guy. the rest of the characters are just various stereotypes of young men and young black men. i like to watch these low budget movies that capture a period of time because they are almost like a documentary of the year's attitudes and fads. phat beach is also funny because the low-budget babes in this movie are strictly home-girls. most low-budget movies have that ""local babe"" quality, and you can tell the babes in this movie were the local strippers and underwear models for jc penneys. some of them had so much cellulite hanging from their bikinis that it was funny to watch how the ""youngsters"" went wild over what was essentially some really over-used, high-mileage skank. there were some cuties too. that is the charm of these low-budget crappy movies. you will see a lot of doggies, and some real cuties! i checked up on some of them at imdb and seven years later phat beach is their only credit. too bad. it would be interesting if someone ever managed to do a ""where are they now"" book on all of the cuties that have appeared in the history of movies and then were never again to return. what happened?? there are probably one or two young people in almost every movie who seem to have a lot going for them and yet years later when you see the movie again on tv you wonder ""what ever happened to x?"" anyhow, this movie mostly blows, but it has some funny moments.",0
"sergio martino's the case of the scorpion's tail is a scenic giallo from the early 70's heyday of the genre. an explosion on an aeroplane results in one million dollars in insurance money for a bereaved but unfaithful wife. the money is subsequently snatched by a black-clad assassin and a series of brutal murders follow.  scorpion's tail plays the mystery element, written by giallo specialist ernesto gastaldi, fairly straight. but, being a giallo, the murders themselves are memorable and well-staged. in fact, the violence in this movie is very strong in places - a scene with a broken bottle being particularly graphic. the emphasis on the violence no doubt influencing the giallo genre to move into more and more extreme territory. but like the best films in the genre the brutality is offset by a good score and attractive photography. the music by bruno nicolai is at times reminiscent of ennio morricone's avant-garde work in the bird with the crystal plumage but is also strong in its own right. the photography is helped by the nice use of foreign locales - in this case london and athens - where martino manages to get in, respectively, the houses of parliament and the acropolis! there is also some inventive camera-work too, the most effective being the use of slow motion in a sequence where a woman runs towards the door where the maniac is prowling outside. in this particular scene martino has the killer hack through the door with a knife in a manner influenced by dario argento's crystal plumage, however, it also has the killer attempt to flick the latch open with the blade of a knife which is something repeated later by argento in suspiria. so martino's film is influential in its own right.  this is a good solid giallo that both genre and non-genre fans can appreciate. the performances are good and the production values are fine (although the plane explosion is, shall we say, somewhat low-budget!). the dvd release by noshame is nice. it has both the english and italian language options which is a real bonus. however, it is worth pointing out that at times you need to be a fast reader to fully appreciate the english subtitle option. this applies to both the movie and the documentary in the extras. this is a minor point though, the dvd release is a worthy addition to any giallo collection.",1
"i had no problem with the film, which i thought was pretty good. it's the actual lapd crime scene video that disturbed me. i wonder if lion's gate really thought that the general viewing audience would want to see people that were brutally beaten to death and blood all over the place. sorry lion's gate, this was an incredibly bad idea!!!  getting back to the film: the cast was excellent, especially val kilmer as the late john holmes. john holmes was a sleaze ,mistreats the women in his life (lisa kudrow as his wife, kate bosworth as his girlfriend),and he is hopelessly deep into drugs. his connection to eddie nash (eric bogosian)creates a spiral that resulted in the infamous wonderland murders. exactly how much was holmes involved in the murders? we may never know the entire truth to the story(nash is still alive and a free man),but the film does a pretty good job nonetheless.",1
"the supernatural, vengeful police officer is back for a third installment, this time acting as guardian angel for a wrongfully accused female cop. standard stalk and slash picture, yet well acted and directed, thus making it oddly interesting and watchable, though the violence isn't for the squeamish (especially the director's cut which was originally given an ""nc-17"" rating).  *1/2 out of ****",0
"i watched this film last night with anticipation, but really wasn't very impressed.  with the exception of 'combo', i thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited. it came across like a 'made for tv' drama.  i felt that the film was very contrived. the whole set up of hammering in the context at the start (yes, we get that this is 80s britain - you can stop now) was tiresome, and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s britain - poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, margaret thatcher, yet nothing in between? there were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. the falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for 'dramatic effect', i presume.  the sequence of events felt a tad disjointed, as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly.  the relationship between 'shaun' and 'smell' was toe-curling. i couldn't even look during the snogging scene. i find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. i know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, yet it's a huge difference in your teens! in my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. sorry, but i didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value.  the ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. if the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes.  it bugs me that british films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken. don't get me wrong, i love trainspotting, and four weddings has its charms, but can't we brits come up with anything different? why are our films always so hung up on the class system? i was born in 1973, so wasn't much different in age to 'shaun' would've been in 1983. i grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in england. however, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - i don't even remember racism being an issue (although i'm not saying it didn't exist). 'this is england'? not in my experience.  the bottom line is that i felt this film lacked substance, and i was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.",0

"why on earth is colin firth in this pointless film? has he really been that strapped for cash?  the film isn't clear on what it wants to be about, grief?, exotic places?, ghosts?, a vehicle for mr darcy? it's a muddled, muddy mess.  there seems to be some sort of idea that italy must be good, in itself, and that italian has something to offer as a language - but in the end the girls just want to go back to yankland.  there are pointless episodes on the beach, in churches, on busy roads - but what it is all about, or why anybody should care simply isn't clear.  there was also a yank woman in the film. it wasn't clear what here job was, but she seemed only to be there to make vapid, inappropriate and maudlin comments to the girl. was it supposed to be about paedophillia??  a pretty dreadful mess, all in all. i gave it 2 rather than 1 because it doesn't have the charm of an utterly ghastly film.",0
"'soapdish' is one of the best, yet least well remembered comedies of the 1990's. the film revolves around the various off-camera drama's that occur behind the scenes of a cheaply produced daytime soap opera. the first of the film's various impressive strengths is it's fantastic a-list cast. 'soapdish' features some of the greatest actors and actresses of it's era.  the film is superbly led by sally field, as the neurotic ageing actress celeste talbert (she famously throws a tantrum when put in a costume that makes her look like ""gloria f*cking swanson!""). her supporting cast reads like a who's-who of 90's movie greats! whoopi goldberg, robert downey jr, teri hatcher, kevin kline and kathy najimy all elevate the film greatly. goldberg is predictably excellent, whilst downey jr.'s and hatcher's performances hint at the comedic excellence they would later achieve.  in terms of writing, the film is outstanding. there is a really modern edge to the script, which strays into the wonderfully bizarre on several occasions. there also several visual gags that are quite ahead of their time. in some ways, the film is reminiscent of mel brooks at his best and frequently reminded this reviewer of 'high anxiety' (1977). much of the film's humour hinges on it's often scathing, but pretty accurate, representations of daytime television and of neurotic and pretentious actors. for example, the extras casting session featuring the exploitative executive played by carrie fisher, is both hilarious and honest.  'soapdish' is, for my money, one of the very best comedies hollywood produced during the 1990's. it's excellent script and a-class cast make it a must-see. it's hard not to love this film after it's kept you laughing for 90 minutes.",1
"this film is ""riveting"" but in much the same way a car crash is riveting. it's hard to look away. overall, this film is nothing more than an incredibly irresponsible social experiment--and a futile, biased experiment at that. the filmmakers are manipulative and seem to have no problems going for the lowest possible denominator. the manner in which the money is presented to ted is pure exploitation. the intervening steps that the filmmakers force ted to participate in (meeting with so-called experts) were empty and devoid of any substantive attempt to connect with ted. instead, it's painfully obvious that they serve to cover the filmmaker's posteriors and to further exploit ted's situation. the worst part is that the filmmakers stop following ted after 6 months; and seemingly are cut off entirely from the subject they had followed so closely months before. if they had cared, they would have found better ""experts"" to help ted. if they truly wanted to see what ted would do, then they should have let him spend the money without any intervention. this film is at best a high-brow jackass stunt and not a documentary. it's sad to think how much $100,000 could have actually changed a homeless person's life had it been put in the right hands.",0
"one of the five worst movies i have ever watched. and i'm not exaggerating. in fact, i recommend watching it so you can get the same feeling of incredulity as you might by watching showgirls.  out of 400 votes, the movie gets a user rating of 5.3/10. but there is a disproportionate number of voters who gave it a 10/10, probably due to the message of the movie - nuclear weapons are the bane of mankind. chuck murdock is an all-star little league pitcher who gives up baseball because there are nuclear weapons. soon ""amazing grace"" smith is an all-star boston celtic who is inspired by chuck's story and gives up basketball. soon all sports leagues from the professional level to college to high school to little league dismantle in a world-wide protest. later all the children of the world go on a silence strike. this inspires the president of the united states to meet with the soviet premier, who in time agree to eliminate all nuclear weapons in time for the start of the next little league season. the movie ends with chuck about to throw out the first pitch, with the president telling his new best friend chuck not to worry about striking out every batter, as he hasn't thrown a baseball in a year.  somewhere along the line a nefarious underworld boss kills amazing grace. when the president finds out he is told that the fbi can verify the killer but will never be able to prove it. so the president calls the underworld boss (""but it's one a.m."" ""i don't care, get him on the line"") and tell him that he is to resign from all company boards that he sits on and sell all stocks that he has. and to not get out of line again.  honestly, this movie was so crappy that i couldn't turn it off. it was on television from 2:30 am to 4:00 am, and i watched it all. i wasn't turned off by the anti-nuclear weapons propaganda. i was turned off by the implausible break down of all organized sports. i don't even understand why ""amazing grace"" smith was killed. and with all these famous athletes becoming chuck's friends, why the father was constantly upset with his son taking a principled stand. and there was the cliché moment near the end when dad tells chuck, ""i never told you this, but i'm proud of you."" cue hug.",0

"""scoop"" is also the name of a late-thirties evelyn waugh novel, and woody allen's new movie, though set today, has a nostalgic charm and simplicity. it hasn't the depth of characterization, intense performances, suspense or shocking final frisson of allen's penultimate effort ""match point,"" (argued by many, including this reviewer, to be a strong return to form) but ""scoop"" does closely resemble allen's last outing in its focus on english aristocrats, posh london flats, murder, and detection. this time woody leaves behind the arriviste murder mystery genre and returns to comedy, and is himself back on the screen as an amiable vaudevillian, a magician called sid waterman, stage moniker the great splendini, who counters some snobs' probing with, ""i used to be of the hebrew persuasion, but as i got older, i converted to narcissism."" following a revelation in the midst of splendini's standard dematerializing act, with scarlett johansson (as sondra pransky) the audience volunteer, the mismatched pair get drawn into a dead ace english journalist's post-mortem attempt to score one last top news story. on the edge of the styx joe strombel (ian mcshane) has just met the shade of one lord lyman's son's secretary, who says she was poisoned, and she's told him the charming aristocratic bounder son peter lyman (hugh jackman) was the tarot card murderer, a london serial killer. sondra and sid immediately become a pair of amateur sleuths. with sid's deadpan wit and sondra's bumptious beauty they cut a quick swath through to the cream of the london aristocracy.  woody isn't pawing his young heroine muse -- as in ""match point,"" johansson again -- as in the past. this time moreover scarlett's not an ambitious sexpot and would-be movie star. she's morphed surprisingly into a klutzy, bespectacled but still pretty coed. sid and sondra have no flirtation, which is a great relief. they simply team up, more or less politely, to carry out strombel's wishes by befriending lyman and watching him for clues to his guilt. with only minimal protests sid consents to appear as sondra's dad. sondra, who's captivated peter by pretending to drown in his club pool, re-christens herself jade spence. mr. spence, i.e., woody, keeps breaking cover by doing card tricks, but he amuses dowagers with these and beats their husbands at poker, spewing non-stop one-liners and all the while maintaining, apparently with success, that he's in oil and precious metals, just as ""jade"" has told him to say.  that's about all there is to it, or all that can be told without spoiling the story by revealing its outcome. at first allen's decision to make johansson a gauche, naively plainspoken, and badly dressed college girl seems not just unkind but an all-around bad decision. but johansson, who has pluck and panache as an actress, miraculously manages to carry it off, helped by jackman, an actor who knows how to make any actress appear desirable, if he desires her. the film actually creates a sense of relationships, to make up for it limited range of characters: sid and sondra spar in a friendly way, and peter and sondra have a believable attraction even though it's artificial and tainted (she is, after all, going to bed with a suspected homicidal maniac).  what palls a bit is allen's again drooling over english wealth and class, things his brooklyn background seems to have left him, despite all his celebrity, with a irresistible hankering for. jackman is an impressive fellow, glamorous and dashing. his parents were english. but could this athletic musical comedy star raised in australia (""x-man's"" wolverine) really pass as an aristocrat? only in the movies, perhaps (here and in ""kate and leopold"").  this isn't as strong a film as ""match point,"" but to say it's a loser as some viewers have is quite wrong. it has no more depth than a half-hour radio drama or a tv show, but woody's jokes are far funnier and more original than you'll get in any such media affair, and sometimes they show a return to the old wit and cleverness. it doesn't matter if a movie is silly or slapdash when it's diverting summer entertainment. on a hot day you don't want a heavy meal. the whole thing deliciously evokes a time when movie comedies were really light escapist entertainment, without crude jokes or bombastic effects; without vince vaughan or owen wilson. critics are eager to tell you this is a return to the allen decline that preceded ""match point."" don't believe them. he doesn't try too hard. why should he? he may be 70, but verbally, he's still light on his feet. and his body moves pretty fast too.",1

"this was a movie i could not wait to see! so i finally got it and i was pretty disappointed. for starters,the movie has so little said about new york,just a bunch of confusing shots of buildings,streets,bridges and cafes.it really doesn't stay focused on the new york magic.another thing that changed my mind was the french movie set inside this movie.i know that it is a remake,but it is not a french style remake! anyway,here you will notice elements that remind you of french movies,such as long and messy scenes,no or little talking and of course everyone is smoking french style ! the story follows many lives ( too many for my taste) and they somehow seem connected in the end. i feel like there was no dedication to the characters as much as there was on the stories. the movie was too short to cover every single destiny everyone's happy ending.so we can see about 30 people for about 5 minutes each.and there you have your 120 minutes ! if you like active scenes dialogues and stuff this is not the movie for you ! i give it 4 just because i love new york and i loved the cast !",0
"unspeakably discombobulated turkey, a mix of anti-nazi musical (!!), pre-war americana and agatha christie whodunit spoof with one big, big problem: it's deadly unfunny. besides the single-digit i.q. plot and dialog, the most amazing aspect of ""lady..."" is the berserk casting. gene wilder (star and co-writer) tries hard at it all: he plays a romantic lead (with his looks!! and his age!! he and woody allen should start a club for clueless, mirrorless ageing comedians), and he tries to be moving and funny and poignant and smart, and tries to sing and dance, and succeeds in none!! a looong shot from his good old days with mel brooks.  for a while i thought i was having a myopia fit, because everybody in the movie keeps saying cherry jones is this pretty hot chick, and that michael cumpsty is this impossibly handsome stallion!! the guy who plays claire bloom's male secretary is a bespectacled balding thin actor as sexy as a chair and is the object of passion of the two leading ladies!! mike starr's over-the-top acting as the most incompetent, phoniest cop you ever saw deserves to rank among the 10 most abhorrent performances in recent film history. the saddest note is to see wonderful claire bloom and barbara sukowa completely miscast and offensively wasted. at least i hope both stars payed their bills back home (and subsequently fired their agents) with this flop. no wonder acting prodigy sukowa returned to germany after she saw what hollywood had in store for her!!  if you want to see how to accomplish a really bad film out of a really bad script with a berserk casting director, study this one - otherwise stay away!!! - 1/10",0
"who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists? what's intended to be a light, frothy comedy about neighbor children who can't give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood, comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant self-indulgence. as children, the pair are unbearably precocious; as adults they're intolerably immature. it's a bad combination.",0
"good show.  the basic background is that humanity is at a crossroads. there is a set of moral dilemmas that are being faced. mankind has made a number of technological breakthroughs, but is mankind mature enough to deal with the its new toys? there is moral decadence in a virtual world. there are religious fanatics who are willing to kill to get attention. i predict (based on the bsg background) that there will be an issue with cylons and slavery. in addition to this, there are all the other problems that we humans bring upon ourselves.  this show is not bsg -- at least not as far as mankind being on the run from a ruthless problem that was ultimately of their own making. there are not a lot of shoot-em-up or space-based special effects either - at least not in the first few episodes i have seen so far.  what it does have are very good stories, characters, and themes. it also has good performances from the actors. they can make a culture which is similar to modern-day society, but alien at the same time be completely believable. like bsg, this show is about humanity - our strengths, weaknesses, potential, and flaws. it may seem a little odd that a human society on a different set of worlds has neckties, antique cars, and chicken. but those things are really more to create a semi-familiar background than anything else. anyone who gets stuck on those details is really missing the point. whether you are from a mafia-style culture or an affluent and high-tech culture, humans and human nature aren't that different 150,000 years ago in a high-tech past than what we see in the world today. wonder if the writers are trying to tell us something.",1
"in stand by me, vern and teddy discuss who was tougher, superman or mighty mouse. my friends and i often discuss who would win a fight too. sometimes we get absurd and compare guys like macgyver and the terminator or rambo and matrix. but now it seems that we discuss guys like jackie chan, bruce lee and jet li. it is a pointless comparison seeing that lee is dead, but it is a fun one. and if you go by what we have seen from jet li in lethal 4 and black mask, you have to at least say that he would match up well against chan. in this film he comes across as a martial arts god.  black mask is about a man that was created along with many other men, to be supreme fighting machines. their only purpose is to win wars that other people lose. they are invincible in some ways. now that is the premise for the film, but what that does is sets up all the amazingly choreographed fight scenes.  jet li is a marvel. he can do things with and to his body that no human being should be able to do. and that is what makes watching him so fun.  besides the martial arts in the film, black mask is strong with humour and that is due to the chemistry that jet has with his co-star, the police officer. they are great together. but to be honest. if anyone is reading this review, they want to know if the film is kick ass in the action department. and the answer to that is a resounding yes!!! lots and lots of gory mindless action. you will love this film.",1
"the movie had so much potential, but due to 70's technology constraints and also a weak script killed the main plot of the film. the book version of the film was much better, and well conceived. if it had been done right in the beginning with sources from the book, it could have been a very cool classic.",0
"i never fail to be amazed and horrified by the evil that has been predicated in the history of the world in the name of religion, and it seems that the machinations of the catholic church in twentieth century ireland rank right up there near the top - considering that the wisdom of history and modern times should have had some sobering effect.  a love divided is the story of a real family scarred by ignorant intolerance and prejudice all in the name of an inane church doctrine. at the beginning of the film, we are offered a view of the bucolic life in a small irish village in which sheila and sean cloney are happily married with two young children. sean is catholic and sheila is protestant, but she has no qualms with their children being raised as catholic. there is no sign of any animosity between the catholics and protestants in the village. the peaceful and loving relationships are soon shattered when sheila expresses the desire to have their older child attend the protestant school. the local priest takes it upon himself to forbid this ""sin"" and soon has sheila's husband and the entire catholic population of the village turned against her as well as her father, the local dairy farmer. in an act of defiance and desperation, sheila kidnaps her two daughters and flees from the area.  special note should be given to orla brady who plays sheila. she gives an extremely powerful performance in which the viewer is drawn in to the emotional trauma in which she decides to reject the wishes of a husband she deeply loves in order to express her fervent desire to establish herself as independent from the pressures of the establishment. on an equal footing is liam cunningham who plays sean for he gives a realistic portrait of a man not nearly as complex as his wife who is torn between his love for her and the influence of church and community.  if fiction, this film would have been a compelling and interesting drama. considering it is true, it changes to a horrific tragedy. in real life, the people and the village never fully recovered from the events that took place there. it took almost half a century for the church to acknowledge its negative role in the events, and even though sheila and sean lived out their lives in the area, they never fully recovered from what was done to them by the religious leaders and their fellow villagers.  whether it be denying basic rights to education of choice, crashing planes into buildings, subjugating women, condemning whole races, or just plain on torture and murder, we humans certainly have the ability to use religion as a powerful negative force in our society.",1
"i don't remember ever seeing this one before tonight, probably the title sounded so ordinary it kept passing me by. but it is a well crafted b western, with an interestingly brooding storyline complimented by acting veering from the good to corny.  robert mitchum slopes into wide open town looking for his wife and news of their daughter, and stays for a time as town-tamer. as usual the good business folk have mixed emotions - they want to get rid of the baddies but like the business they bring. it still applies: relax drink and gambling laws and encourage the industries but pretend to deplore the seedy effects it can have on ordinary people. what's fascinating about this film is mitchum's cynically intense portrayal in going about cleaning the town of baddies, and the townsfolk's acceptance that his violent methods were the only ones. favourite bit: the sudden demise of 2 of the baddies in the red dog saloon. the firing of the main saloon bordered on nasty, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison.  overall a very good film with its only fault tending to be a little hokeyness - not so good for do-gooders who would probably prefer a lifetime of negotiation with evil rather than end it.",1
"i totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie. this is a totally sucked movie. i mean sucked - s.u.c.k.e.d. the story development is strange. mia kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a party-fun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all. in addition, all the actresses looked way too old for being college students - college students looked like about 30 years old - you figure out the rest. i watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes. all the sex scenes are lame, hasty and, most importantly, no frontal at all. all the sex scenes are laughable, considering how many clothes they had on. do yourself a favor - put it down and save yourself a few bucks. conclusion: story - 0, sex - 0, acting - 0, score - 0 out 10.",0
"like all cult tv shows, there is a group of people who love the twilight zone so much that they rate practically every episode like they are the greatest shows ever. while several of them are indeed wonderful classics, the truth is for every great episode, there were several that were mediocre and at least one that stank. however, like die-hard trekkies, these zone lovers insist that all of them are gold. in fact, this is what initially got me to review some individual episodes of a couple cult series instead of the movies i usually watch.  while this isn't the worst episode ever made nor is it among the very worst, it is poor by any reasonable standard. a widow watches a long procession of civil war soldiers going past her home. in the end, a very unexpected twist is revealed and there isn't a whole lot of excitement or suspense here.",0
"i didn't expect much from this tv movie. you have to set the bar lower than you would for midget limbo for any tbs movie starring antonio sabato jr. still, it managed to disappoint, failing even to be a good-bad film.  every scene was by rote, as if someone had cut and pasted scenes from a dozen movies and tv shows dealing with big business conspiracies into the script, leaned back and said, ""my work is done"". it's all cliche, all predictable, and, even worse, the actors are forced to look like they're taking it seriously, (even when the plot developments are laughable).  do yourself a favor. watch ""the x-files"" if you're in the mood for paranoia. they handle it better. also, let anyone know that sitting through ""fatal error"" is just that.",0
"this is a great film. from reading other reviews, i can see that i'm not the only one who shed a tear. tamilyn tomita acted with such skill and conviction, she made the ending heartfelt and memorable. in the hands of a lesser actress, her last scene would have seemed trite and corny. one would never guess this film was done on a tight, limited budget. the cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors. the script is so wonderful, i can see why they all wanted to be in it. if you watch the long, long list of credits at the end, you'll see that half of hawaii pitched in to make this film happen, and for good reason. the soundtrack (available on cd) is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film. my only ""complaint"" is that i almost didn't want the film to end.",1
"this poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well, then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects. for example, in the original, one of the most chilling moments occurs when nell and theo are lying side by side in twin beds, listening in terror to the noises outside their room. nell tells theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her. nell then looks across at theo, who is several feet away and realises that it was not theo holding her hand. in the latest version, nell is lying alone in bed, when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor. it is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened. and can anybody explain what nell's final words mean - ""it's about family. it's always been about family""?  the one redeeming feature is lili taylor's performance, but even this cannot save the film. catherine zeta-jones demonstrates once again that, beneath her pretty exterior, there is little depth. in the original, claire bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion. zeta-jones, however has to spell it out, for example, by asking nell if she has a boyfriend - or girlfriend.  definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard.",0
"tachigui: the amazing lives of the fast-food grifters japanese title: tachiguishi retsuden  director: mamoru oshii featuring: toshio suzuki, mako hyodo, kenji kawai, shinji higuchi, katsuya terada narrated by koichi yamadera ----------------------------------------  way back in 1995, mamoru oshii unleashed his dazzling animation feature ghost in the shell, which helped consolidate anime's international acceptance - and also burrowed itself into andy and larry wachowski's overall concept for the matrix.  the movie's sequel, innocence (2004), was the inaugural japanese animated film to compete for the palme d'or at cannes, and it left heads spinning as much for its style and innovative effects as for its oft unfathomable plot.  always the trendsetter, oshii has now presented us with tachigui: the amazing lives of the fast-food grifters  which has absolutely nothing to do with ghost in the shell, nor japanese anime for that matter.  say hello to oshii's creation ""superlivemation"": not quite animation, nor exactly live-action. instead the cast endured somewhere in the vicinity of 30,000 snapshots, which were digitally processed and reconstituted in a deceptively simple paper cut-out fashion reminiscent of balinese puppetry. the movement itself is a stilted, stop-motion style that echoes sequences from shinya tsukamoto's experimental tetsuo: iron man (1988).  ""i couldn't think of any method but this one,"" said oshii in a recent interview with the daily yomiuri. ""i realized that this project was not suitable for traditional animation.""  the cast choice is equally enigmatic. kenji kawai - who also composed the superlative soundtrack - appears as a ravenous burger fanatic, while renowned studio ghibli producer toshio suzuki spends his screen time being murdered in bizarre fashion. others include katsuya terada, who dabbled with oshii on blood: the last vampire, and shinji higuchi - a special effects whiz who's worked on godzilla movies.  koichi yamadera's narration sounds like the stuff of a dry nhk documentary  which belies the comic undertone here as well as yamadera's extensive career voicing stoic anime characters like spike siegel in cowboy bebop.  and the plot itself is a bizarre re-imagining of post-wwii japan in the context of various fast-food off-shoots - from soba ramen shops to gyudon stand-up bars; american dogs in the heat-up trays of convenience stores to mcdonalds- inspired burger-chain restaurants. ""food is a primal root of desire,"" asserted oshii, by way of explanation.   thrown into the mix is a new breed of consumer: the fast-food grifters of the title, people who don't like to pay for their tucker and are constantly fine-tuning their elaborate scams to score free munchies.   oshii said his ulterior motive was homage to the ""art"" of eating food on the streets  something still considered a bit of a taboo in this country, and which goes some way toward explaining the use of ""tachigui"" in the title.  the director of live-action movies (avalon, stray dog) as well as animation, oshii has often blurred the definition between the two mediums. the celluloid result here is deposited somewhere in the grey area between both formats.  at times the visual experiment here is as exhilarating as it can be irritating. just don't ask what it's all really supposed to mean; oshii's films, which are equal parts cerebral and innovative, are often not particularly clear story-wise. where oshii succeeds is via a liberal dose of black humor  here you'll find kentucky fried rat, death by hula-hoop, the world's fastest samurai burger chef  and in the movie's very nature of surrealism.  this is a man who defers to the influence of filmmakers like godard and truffaut, and perhaps owes as much to andrei tarkovsky as he does david lynch. so it shouldn't come as any surprise that at one stage a b-52 bomber does a fly- through in a yoshinoya look-alike franchise. the 54-year-old writer-director seemed to think this natural. ""the japan i depicted in the movie may not necessarily be faithful to reality,"" he suggested.  of course. --------------  by andrez bergen",1
"i watched this film without knowing anything about it whatsoever and found it similar thematically to billy elliott (2000). both films are based around a troubled father/son relationship. in both films, the son does not want to follow his father down the mines and dreams of a better life away from their home town. both sons face derision by their classmates and both have a strong female role model who teaches them.  the major difference that i found between the films was that october sky was an infinitely more interesting and touching film. laura dern puts in a moving performance and chris cooper plays the disapproving father very well as he went on to do in american beauty (1999). joe johnston surprised me with his subtle directing, very different from his other directorial features such as jumanji (1995) and jurassic park iii (2001).

"this movie is without a doubt a perfect 10/10.. for all you people out there who are rating this film low grades because it has no ""good plot"" or anything like that, thats ridiculous, saying that a jackie chan movie is bad because of its plot is like saying a porn movie is bad because it has no plot! you watch jackie chan for the fight scenes, for the action its not so much concentrated on a good story or anything like that, if you look at how he makes movies and compare it to other american films from that era and even later you will realize that jackie chan's movies had over the top fights scenes and not really good plots while american movies had good plots but shitty action scenes compared to what jackie chan was doing at the time. porn is watched for the porn, jackie chan is watched for the action, i think you people are rating it bad because there's no plot because you think thats how a smart movie critic would rate a good movie but the way i see it is a good movie is a movie that can keep me entertained. sure the middle of the movie was boring, very boring, but put it this way the rest which is all action scenes and stunts very much do pay for all of that. this did change the way how american action movies were created, they have even stollen scenes from this movie. if you want a true man, a true entertainer then watch this movie and many more of jackie chan's, hes pure in everyway. he literally makes american movies look like a walk in the park, and even in todays movies. american movies rely so much on special effects and safety wires and stunt doubles and so much more. police story and many other jackie chan films are pieces of work of a true entertainer who just goes all out and is very talented in what he can do. a masterpiece",1

"just emailed a friend who's in film school about this flick. something to avoid when making a film - characters blabbering senseless, overwrought, convoluted monologues on screen that are ultimately trite and unconvincing. if the film is an attempt at social realism, these verbal barrages are so over-the-top that they actually draw attention to the film constructed as film and effectively neutralize that intent. is it the acting, or the script that is bad, or both?  the protagonist is also highly unbelievable for social realism - ravenously consuming canonical english literature and the bible while high or hungover and able to produce such profoundly sophomoric soliloquies while intoxicated? and how is such an unattractive, unwashed and verbally noxious character able to bed most of the women he meets within minutes of encountering them? (i had to applaud when one chick finally threw him out onto the street, despite his whining and self-pitying banter).  the viewer encounters pretentious references to ancient greek literature, nostradamus and the book of revelations. the impending doom of mankind, in the form of bar codes imprinted on our foreheads or right hands in spooky biblical fashion, is presented to a character who is oh-so-cleverly exposed in his role as a guardian of empty space.   this flick is over-scripted and over the top - a melodrama clumsily infused with pedestrian ""philosophy"" about the meaning of mankind, life, etc. it is trite, overwrought and tedious.  there are some very fine english films available with content similar to this film. ""nil by mouth"" is an excellent, far more interesting excursion into the lives of individuals in a similar social milieu. ditto for ""in the warzone."" and although the comparison is not even warranted, check out anything by peter greenaway, who far more deftly handles dialogue, wit and absurd characters and situations.",0
"another reason to watch this delightful movie is florence rice. florence who? that was my first reaction as the opening credits ran on the screen. i soon found out who florence rice was, a real beauty who turns in a simply wonderful performance. as they all do in this gripping ensemble piece. from 1939, its a different time but therein lies the charm. it transports you into another world. it starts out as a light comedy but then turns very serious. florence rice runs the gamut from comedienne to heroine. she is absolutely delightful, at the same time strong, vulnerable evolving from a girl to a woman.watch her facial expressions at the end of the movie. she made over forty movies, and i am going to seek out the other thirty nine. alan marshal is of the flynn/gable mode and proves a perfect match for florence. buddy ebsen and una merkel provide some excellent comic moments, but the real star is florence rice. fans of 30's/40's movies, don't miss this one!",1
"i was fascinated as to how truly bad this movie was. was the viewer supposed to learn something, or reflect on anything here? what was up with the pumpkins? was i supposed to be impressed with the motel shots? does it matter that there are some garbage bags on a rooftop across the street of a hotel? why does the narrator unsuccessfully mock the people he interviews (it is so obvious that he edited out the really informative parts of his interviews to achieve mockery). the best part of the movie was the interview with the film professor who tells us how bad this movie will be even before it is finished.  i am truly amazed. i believe that the creator is struggling to become an intellectual or is trying to impress the intellectual community.",0

"after witnessing his wife (linda hoffman) engaging in sexual acts with the pool boy, the already somewhat unstable dentist dr. feinstone (corbin bernsen) completely snaps which means deep trouble for his patients.  this delightful semi-original and entertaining horror flick from director brian yuzna was a welcome change of pace from the usual horror twaddle that was passed out in the late nineties. although the dentist' is intended to be a cheesy, fun little film, yuzna ensures that the movie delivers the shocks and thrills that many more serious movies attempt to dispense. despite suffering somewhat from the lack of background on the central characters, and thus allowing events that should have been built up to take place over a couple of days, the movie is intriguing, generally well scripted and well paced which allows the viewer to maintain interest, even during the more ludicrous of moments. the dentist' suffers, on occasion, from dragging but unlike the much inferior 1998 sequel, there are only sporadic uninteresting moments, and in general the movie follows itself nicely.  corbin bernsen was very convincing in the role of the sadistic, deranged and perfectionist dr. alan feinstone. the way bernsen is able to credibly recite his lines, especially with regards to the foulness and immorality of sex (particularly fellatio), is something short of marvellous. while many actors may have trouble portraying a cleanliness obsessed psycho without it coming off as too cheesy or ridiculous, bernsen seems to truly fit the personality of the character he attempts to portray and thus makes the film all that more enjoyable. had the dentist' not been intended to be a fun, almost comical, horror movie, bernsen's performance would probably have been much more powerful. sadly, the rest of the cast (including a pre-fame mark ruffalo) failed to put in very good performances and although the movie was not really damaged by this, stronger performances could have added more credibility to the flick.  the dentist' is not a horror film that is meant to be taken seriously but is certainly enjoyable, particularly (i would presume) for fans of cheesy horror. those who became annoyed at the number of scream' (1996) clones from the late nineties may very well find this a refreshing change, as i did. a seldom dull and generally well paced script as well as some proficient direction helps to make the dentist' one of the more pleasurable cheesy horrors from the 1990's. on top of this we are presented with some particularly grizly and (on the whole) realistic scenes of dental torture, which should keep most gorehounds happy. far from perfect but far from bad as well, the dentist' is a flick that is easily worth watching at least once. my rating for the dentist'  6.5/10.",1
"one of the things that interested me most about this film is the way the characters and their associated histories are developed on the fly. i suppose the writers wanted us to gain interest in the characters by not force feeding their characters. the premise of using the art and craft of furniture design and construction was a unique theme and/or analogy for what families/siblings go through in life. the complexity of having a twin serve as a surrogate father and even husband added great tension towards making this film emotionally interesting. also, although the story was not one that the masses might directly relate to (i.e. jewish/twins/family business) the themes are fairly universal as every family has a black sheep in it. that made it very engaging.",1
"simply well written, directed and acted... woody's best of the 2000's if not his best since the 80's!! hugh jackman was the perfect pick for his roll. scarlett johansson's banter with woody proves how well rounded an actress she has become.  it's refreshing to not being in a romance on screen with the leading lady. he plays the perfect bumbling magician.  there have been a few reviews maligning this movie. don't let them stop you from seeing the wonderfully done film. people in the crowd i saw this with were laughing so loud at some lines i missed the next line. if you like woody allen films of the 70's, you'll regret missing this one.  i suggest you go to watch this film with an open mind, if you do, you might walk out smiling.",1
"this is one of my favorites along with the mariette hartley and robert lansing ""sandy"" and the agnes moorhead-and-the-tiny-spacemen episodes.  it is an important take, from mid-1961, on the long cold war that the u.s. was then embroiled in. the beaten-down city-scene, the near-starving characters' sparse dialog, their threadbare uniforms, and the minimal action ""says"" it all: the absurdity of an on-going conflict that threatens to destroy human life, modern civilization, and all that is sweet and redeeming about it.  it is a ""fable"" because it was made in a time in which, had events turned out differently, such as the second berlin crisis (spring 1961) and the subsequent cuban missile crisis (oct. 1962), it would have actually been a reasonable representation of one of the u.s.'s major cities, ruined and replete with a few miserable survivors. i also see it as a ""fable"" because it is not only a cautionary tale, but because it is the most redemptive of all our popular myths: it is a love story, set in an impossible situation, and involving two highly mismatched lovers.",1
"the film is severely awful and is demeaning to rape victims. on the surface, it may be a daring film about rape but if you dig beneath the surface, what lies is a not-so-positive message about rape. aishwarya the rape victim is shown to be a helpless victim who cannot cope all because she is a woman. she needs a man to help her. when the society makes jibes about her and throws comments at her, she does not stand up for herself. it is all left to anil kapoor to do all the talking while aishwarya does all the crying.  the director (satish kaushik) went down the wrong path by portraying a rape victim as weak and submissive. what would have been more effective is portraying a strong woman who rebels against her enemies in a courageous way. the director is famous for being chauvinistic. his films are usually full of weak women but he tries to hide them in controversial roles. he needs to learn that just because the role is controversial, it does not mean that the character herself is strong.  the most degrading scene in the film is when aishwarya 'cleans' herself after just being raped. she does it to please her father who thinks that she is now dirty. though it is commendable that shah shows the stigma against rape victims in such a stark light, what he does not show us is whether ash's father was wrong for making his daughter do such a thing. thus we are left with a confusing message about rape.  the comedy too is not needed in a strong subject film like this. even more so, the comedy is simply not funny. ash is wooden in her role while anil kapoor does nothing but shout. the music is mediocre except for the title track, which is beautifully picturised (the only bright point of this film). sonali bendre's role is disappointing and pointless. overall, what could have been a great movie to remember ends up being an awful mish-mash that will give some viewers severe indigestion.",0
"the single worst film i've ever seen in a theater. i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004, and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival. it was an interesting premise, and seemed like it could go somewhere, but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything. first of all, if you're going to do a musical, find someone with musical talent. the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming. the lyrics were terribly written, and when they weren't obvious rhymes, they were groan-inducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to try to make this movie work. and you'd think you'd find people who could sing when making a musical, right? not in this case. luckily they were half talking/half singing in rhyme most of the time, but when they did sing it made me cringe. especially when they attempted to sing in harmony. and that just addresses the music. some of the acting was pretty good, but a lot of the dialog was terrible, as well as most of the scenes. they obviously didn't have enough coverage on the scenes, or they just had a bad editor, because they consistently jumped the line and used terrible choices while cutting the film. at least the director was willing to admit that no one wanted the script until they added the hook of making it a musical. i hope the investors make sure someone can write music before making the same mistake again.",0
"i am a big fan of cinema verite and saw this movie because i heard how interesting it was. i can honestly say it was very interesting indeed. the two lead actors are awesome, the film isn't ever boring, and the concept behind it (though obviously inspired by the columbine killings and the home movies of the killers) is really interesting. there are some weaknesses, such as the final 20 minutes which really detracts from the realism seen in the first hour or so and the ending really doesn't make any sense at all. the shaky camera sometimes can be a distraction, but in cinema verite that is a given. but i still think the movie is very well done and the director ben coccio deserves some credit.",1
"some wonder why there weren't anymore mrs. murphy movies after this one. will it's because this movie totally blew snot. disney was not the right studio to run this film. maybe touchstone (well, they're owned by disney, but it'd be more adult). the film is too kid-ish, as the book series is not. the casting is all wrong for the characters. the characters don't even act the way they do in the books. and why was tucker changed to a guy? he's a girl in the frigging books! was this done to make the film appeal to boys? sheesh. and where was pewter, the gray cat? one of the funniest characters from the book is absent from this filth. rita mae brown is a good writer, but letting disney blow her work was wrong. an animated feature film, perhaps in the vane of don bluth's artwork would suit a better mrs. murphy film. overall, i give this a 2, because at least disney made a film from an under-appreciated book series. but, i wish they did better. either way, i still have my books to entertain me.",0
"as someone else mentioned, it begins with a bizarre prologue about a little blond girl killing a cat. then the main story: a photographer (gaffari) and a writer (shepard) meet by chance and take a trip into the mountains. first they spend the night at an inn where the slightly deaf landlord gets hollered at, with increasing irritation to the audience, by gaffari. once in the mountains they seek shelter again and are invited in by a kindly old lady who seems overly hospitable to strangers (hansel and gretel, anyone?) what happens next i will leave for the bold viewer to sort out because i most assuredly couldn't. now, i like eurohorror, and this woulda been better if only artigot (writer and director) had made some attempt at logical story telling. the backdrop (pyrenees?) makes an excellent and intriguing location for mysterious and occult occurrences. the verdant peaks could easily obscure supernatural forces and those who command them. the photography is nice. just wish the whole thing made sense. you can view this film at archive.org.",0
"what starts out as a gentle country yarn, inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton's initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister, as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western.  an amiable rancher (norton) wanders into town and charms a young girl (evan rachel wood), seemingly rescuing her from a dead-end existence with her bad-tempered father with a whirlwind romance, but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye.  edward norton  a real chameleon actor (with changing facial hair to match) playing a country hick, accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he's merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent. he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan. however, with too many small changes it means we are never sure exactly where harlan is coming from, and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused. evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton.  down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace, and by never really making the protagonist's motives clear the audience's sympathies for the characters remain uncertain. should we like this drifter or not? even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear. this ambiguity is to the film's detriment, as if the writer could not make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch-potch. had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film, but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess. fans of old-fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone. completist fans of norton aside (or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley), give this a miss.",0
"this movie is hilarious! i watched it with my friend and we just had to see it again. this movie is not for you movie-goers who will only watch the films that are nominated for academy awards (you know who you are.)i won't recap it because you have seen that from all the other reviews.  ""whipped"" is a light-hearted comedy that had me laughing throughout. it doesn't take itself too seriously and should be watched with your friends, not your girlfriend. it won't win any awards, but it just has to be watched to be appreciated. true, some of the jokes are toilet humor, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. everyone can use some of it sometimes. some people need to lighten up and see ""whipped"" for what it is, not what it isn't.  ****1/4 out of *****.",1
"i am astounded at the positive reviews for this thoroughly uninspiring film.  often with foreign films i skip over reviews that complain about slow pace and seeming ""absence of action"" as many of the best international films do not live up to the western hollywood model of cinematic storytelling.  i enjoy the frequent artfulness and lack of cliché in the foreign film arena. i enjoy that many foreign films don't tie things up in a neat palatable little bow.  that said, this particular film offered no redemptive value for the time i wasted watching it. no meaningful character development, no engaging story arc, no way to get emotionally involved with any of the characters on screen.   synopsis: a bunch of emotionally immature uptight prejudiced colonials mistreat their slaves, and a little girl gets hurt by her only friend when the ""house-boy"" finally gets fed up and takes his abuse out on her.   while the above paragraph is poignant and dramatic, this movie will bore you while playing out the scenario. i was so unengaged that it took three sittings to finish it, and i wouldn't have even done that were it not for the positive ratings.   unless you have an academic interest in the period i strongly suggest steering clear of this one.",0
"if you like occasional nudity with junior high school level slap stick comedy, then look no further.  starting at about the halfway point, the beautiful and erotic arielle dombasle starts disrobing at every opportunity. that is the only thing that made this movie worth watching.  the story is both lame and preposterous, the humor is corny, and character development is basically non-existent.",0

"cash (now played by khrystyne haje in for angelina jolie) has wandered to a post apocalypse wasteland (after her protector has died from old age, said protector was played by elias koteas, an actual decent actor) and now she finds that people wander through the rubble looking for cyborgs to trade for scrap metal and cash. she leads a group of burned out cyborgs (that includes william katt, evan lurie and a human scientist played by zach galligan) against bounty hunter richard lynch. malcolm mcdowell has two minutes of screen time as lynch's employer. cyborg 3 does manage to be better than the other two entries but it still is a largely dull feature. the problem this time is that the ideas with potential are never used well, the action sequences are routine and the name cast such as mcdowell, katt and galligan are given little to do. haje is indeed a whiny heroine and lynch is too over the top(as usual) and the film lacks the inspiration or ambition to be as fun-bad as it's hilarious predecessor. (the one with van damme, the second one is just dull.) also disappointing is the science fiction angle which almost aggressively resists any good idea it has. as an action flick this is routine and by the numbers b-movie stuff and it is competently made, that's the only thing positive i can say about it.  *1/2 out of 4-(poor)",0
"i must say, i thought i had seen it all. i am an extremely jaded movie buff. this movie didn't shock me, by any means. i'm way past that point. but it did take me to certain emotional places i didn't know i could go to. i had no idea i could ever find (ick) the idea of beastiality erotic. never never never. ever. ever. but there you go. he did it. i have to give the director credit. he pulled it off.  for the first 40 minutes this movie is a total bore. we start off with some very explicit footage of two horses having sex. after five minutes of this i started wondering if buying this movie wasn't a mistake. then an old guy in a wheelchair talks to some other old guy about two people getting married. then some nervous guy shaves. then we see (briefly) a hot chick getting it on with a butler (but this is very brief). at this point i was cursing the movie out loud while trying to stay awake. in fact, i fell asleep at about the 40 minute mark and forced myself to finish it the next night.  we finally get the good stuff when a girl (who knows who she is, or who anyone is in this movie) has a dream about a victorian-era gal being ravaged by a beast-thing in the forest. the scene goes on for quite some time and is really the meat (heh-heh) of the whole deal. it's beautifully shot, superbly edited, and does deliver the goods. they do try to wrap up the plot at the end and it sort of makes sense but sort of doesn't either. oh well. i would definitely recommend this film. the first 40 minutes made me want to shoot myself (and my tv) but the last 50 minutes totally redeems it.",1
"when a small hobbit named frodo baggins inherits a magic ring from his uncle, the wizard gandalf investigates and discovers that the ring is an ancient creation of an evil dark lord. should the ring end up back in his hands, he will regain his power and destroy middle earth. frodo and his loyal friends set out on a a quest to destroy the ring with a band of warriors. this is an underrated adaption of the classic novels as it only covers the first half of the story. regardless, this is an epic and wonderfully animated film.  the animation is superbly done with rotoscope, which is tracing over live action footage. ralph bakshi worked well with the low budget he was given. the film also boasts a grand music score by leonard rosenman that fits every scene. there are a few plot holes with the script, but that has to be excused, considering the original deal was to make the book trilogy into two films, much had to crammed in the first one. my biggest gripe is some of the character design, samwise was a bit too goofy, while the other hobbits act completely normal. the other characters are actually well written for the screen, and the voice actors do a great job, i was pleased that legolas is actually a bit more helpful to the plot. the rotoscoped orcs are more comical than frightening, while the ringwraiths are eerie and nightmarish.  another problem is that the evil wizard saruman is called aruman, thanks to the writers. overall, i think a little more money and better writers would have done this a lot of justice, but there is something charming about it. ralph bakshi made a valiant effort of making screen adaption of these classic stories. the film suffers terribly from being overshadowed by the live action films, but it's still a great movie for animation lovers of all ages.",1
"man, i really love the new dvd that universal put out. i've never seen the sentinel look this good since i had to put up with crappy, grainy vhs tapes for years. unfortunately there are no extras beyond a trailer that looks pretty worse for wear. and avoid the goodtimes dvd at all costs. it sucks.  anyway, troubled fashion model alison parker (cristina raines) moves into haunted nyc brownstone, only it's more than just haunted. it's also a portal to hell and the vatican keeps an old blind priest (john carradine) to keep watch over it and make sure the devils and arch-angels don't escape.   this has an all star cast full of old-timey actors like ava gardner, arthur kennedy, jose ferrer etc... as well as cameos of upcoming 80s stars including christopher walken, jeff goldblum (who's voice was mysteriously overdubbed) and tom berenger. and you won't even recognize jerry orbach from law & order. i had to do a double-take when i didn't quite place where i'd seen him before.  nice gore scenes of alison slicing the eye and nose off her dead father's rotting corpse that's been possessed by the devil. and there's a neat ending where disfigured, deformed people try to haunt alison into committing suicide so she won't be the next one to guard the portal. it seems alison's troubled past makes her a prime candidate by the vatican to become the next sentinel.  an excellent, creepy 70s classic from director michael winner that shouldn't be missed. i also recommended it for those who want something a little more imaginative beyond the usual stupid teenager slashers and horror comedy.  7 out of 10  -",1

"********spoilers--careful*********  what can i say? i'm biased when it comes to urban cowboy. i love it and have watched it countless times--and usually find out something new about it with each viewing.  i think one of the things i like about it is that urban cowboy is about working class people, not rich people who live in either l.a. or new york. well, it is true except for pam.  travolta plays bud, a small town texas boy who moves to houston to work in the oil fields. and this is when travolta actually played in good dramatic movies like saturday night fever instead of playing stereotypical bad guys/good guys in big budget movies. this is a really good movie--the mechanical bull riding contest and two-step dancing may be silly, but you have to enjoy this for what it is.  bud meets sissy (played by debra winger with slutty brilliance)--and soon after, they are married and living in their dream trailer. but their relationship becomes a real life battle of the sexes. bud wants to be a real cowboy. sissy wants to be with a real cowboy. but in modern times, men's roles are not as clear. where can bud prove he's a real man? he can work his dangerous job by day and ride the mechanical bull by night--he can be a ""urban cowboy."" but sissy wants to drive his pick-up truck, and she wants to ride the mechanical bull, too. so where does this leave bud? as sissy asserts her independence, she lies about riding the bull and flirts with the ex-con and prison rodeo star--a real bull rider--, wes (played wonderfully greasy by scott glenn). bud is threatened, and bud and sissy break up.  sissy shacks up with wes, who abuses her. emasculating himself further, bud becomes the boy toy of pam, a rich girl whose daddy is in oil and all that implies. sissy comes by the trailer to clean it up--pam doesn't do that kind of thing. she writes a make up letter to bud, but evil pam tears it up and takes the credit for sissy's housework.  bud's uncle bob dies tragically at work when lightening strikes and causes an explosion. bud and sissy have a chance at reconciliation, but are too stubborn. later the mechanical bull riding competition is at gilley's, and you know bud is going to win. pam realizes that bud doesn't love her, but sissy--he did it for her. wes tries to rob gilleys, but wouldn't you know that urban cowboy, bud, saves the day and wins back the woman he loves.  of course, you may ask yourself why bud and sissy would go to gilleys about every night and ""live like pigs."" maybe that contributed to their bad marriage. or why didn't bud stay with pam--she wasn't that bad and had money. or why they had to kill off uncle bob. or why bud and sissy had such stupid friends like marshall and jessie who were always trying to break them up: marshall says to bud, ""she {sissy} rides that bull better than you do!"" but part of the fun of urban cowboy is making fun of it a little bit--and saying, isn't that bonnie raitt on the stage!",1

"the order starts in rome where the head of a special order of priests who deal in ghosts & demons named brother dominic (francesco carnelutti) is found dead, cut to new york city where one of his order alex bernier (heath ledger) is contacted by top-brass cardinal driscoll (peter weller) who ask's him to investigate the mysterious circumstances surrounding dominic's death. along with his girlfriend mara willims (shannyn sossamon) & fellow priest thomas garrett (mark addy) alex travels to italy to delve into his mentor's death, as the truth begins to emerge it appears that dominic was a 'sin eater' someone who absorbed other's sins & lived with the burden of them so they could die peacefully & that the church wasn't happy about his activities. alex must do what's right even if it goes against what he believes...  also know under the title the sin eater this american german co-production was written, produced & directed by bian helgeland & didn't really do that much for me if i'm honest & i usually am, honest that is. anyway lets start with the mess of a script that has some ok ideas but it's throughly predictable, excruciatingly dull & boring, really silly at times & it takes itself far too seriously. the whole concept is daft & while it thinks it's clever with it's oh so neat twist ending that ties everything up & brings the story full circle i thought it was the most obvious & lazy way to end things. there's the usual religious themes here, morality, sin, forgiveness, faith, belief, prophecy's, blah, blah, blah you know the sort of thing. then there's the twists which aren't hard to see coming, there's the abuse of power by high ranking clergymen, corruption, greed, evil, etc. you know the sort of clichéd hollywood ideals & themes that get reused every time it deals with the church. the order has nothing new to say & as a serious piece of film-making it sucks, a lot. i'm not too sure who the order is meant to appeal to, as a die-hard horror fan i didn't see much horror in this at all, as a thriller it's less than thrilling, as a mystery it's too predictable & there's nothing here to really grip or maintain ones interest & for some reason i cannot figure out the imdb also lists the order as an action film which is absurd as it's as exciting & action-packed as the average episode of sesame street (1969 - present), harsh maybe but it's what i think...  director helgeland does an ok job, the film seems to have a very soft lighting scheme & it all looks a bit drab, grayish & dull. for a supposed horror film the order is very light on scares or horror elements, in fact there aren't any of either apart from two evil kids who can turn into a flock of birds for no apparent reason, don't ask. forget about any gore or violence as there isn't any which is fine but it would have helped at least make the order somewhat watchable. according the imdb's 'trivia' section the release date of the order was put back so some of the special effects could be improved because they looked unintentionally funny, all i can say is judging by the finished film the effects must have been really bad to start with because they aren't exactly brilliant as it stands now.  i was amazed to see the order had a budget of about $28,000,000 which is a hell of a lot of money & i just can't see where it all went apart from the sets & production design which are good. the whole film looks & feels very average & utterly forgettable. the acting is ok although the annoying fat guy who seems to be some sort of foul-mouthed comic relief irritates, a good actor such as peter weller deserves better than this.  the order, i prefer the title the sin eater actually not that it matters too much, misses all of it's intended targets by the proverbial mile as far as i'm concerned & is a pretty dull way to waste 100 odd minutes of your life so don't do it! not recommended.",0
"when this movie first came out back in 1984, prince was one of the hottest acts around. everyone wanted to see this movie, which was not much more than a extended music video. the acting was pretty bad, but what can you expect from musicians acting on the big screen for the first time? despite that, it was still a very entertaining film! morris day and jerome benton provide some all time classic comedy, especially their rendition of ""the password"", which will make you think of abbott & costello doing their ""who's on first"" baseball routine.  appolina (who went by a single name then) provided some beautiful breasts, so you had the brief nudity covered. plus, she is very attractive. and of course, the soundtrack of the album is one of the best prince ever recorded. prince later on had a fallout with warner bros. and changed his name, but at this particular time in his career, he was at the top of his game.  this movie doesn't rank in the all time great category, but it is pretty entertaining.",1
"a solid b movie.  i like jake weber. his understated delivery is refreshing in a time of over the top performances. i liked the relationship between the father and son. i liked the family dynamics. the wendigo looks silly, but it is a representation of the kid's toy and the dead deer. it's an amalgamation like, see? this is a psychological story, not a freddy slash em up instant gratification flick. watch it and reflect on your inner child and what the movie might have to say to you and you'll be fine.  nice work.",1
"i thought it was one of the best sequels i have seen in a while. sometimes i felt as though i would just want someone to die, stanley's killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant. it was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died. my only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird. judd nelson is cute, at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as stanley caldwell. brilliant movie.",1
"2 stars, and i'm being generous. (minor spoilers) look, this is a low budget zombie movie set in gangland oakland. as the plot goes, a scientist wants to bring his dead brother back to life after being killed in a drive-by.  the main problem with this movie: what zombies?! all the ""zombies"" do is growl (which doesn't sound even remotely scary) and drip fake red blood from their mouths! no scary eyes, no decaying flesh, just a bunch of people growling pathetically and running around like idiots.  the cover is also misleading. there are only about 6 zombies in the whole film, so it's not like the whole ""hood"" is plagued with zombies or anything, it's just a few, and is contained in no time.  the acting actually is so bad it's hilarious. no one can act at all in this movie (except maybe one of the gang members) and it really seems like a bunch of friends got together, decided to cast their family, and made a movie one weekend.  final note: since when do doctors wear tracksuits?! skip this one, please!",0
"what the ........... is this ? this must, without a doubt, be the biggest waste of film, settings and camera ever. i know you can't set your expectations for an 80's slasher high, but this is too stupid to be true. i baught this film for 0.89$ and i still feel the urge to go claim my money back. can you imagine who hard it stinks ?  who is the violent killer in this film and what are his motivations??? well actually, you couldn't possible care less. and why should you? the makers of this piece of garbage sure didn't care. they didn't try to create a tiny bit of tension. the director ( stephen carpenter -- i guess it's much easier to find money with a name like that ) also made the kindred (1986) wich was rather enjoyable and recently he did soul survivors. complete crap as well, but at least that one had eliza dushku. this junk has the debut of daphne zuniga !!! ( who ?? ) yeah that's right, the melrose place chick. her very memorable character dies about 15 min. after the opening credits. she's the second person to die. the first victim dies directly in the first minute, but nobody seems to mention or miss him afterwards so who cares ? the rest of the actors...they don't deserve the term actors actually, are completely uninteresting. you're hoping they die a quick and painful death...and not only their characters  my humble opinion = 0 / 10",0
"not much to say on this one. a plot you can pretty much peg, in the first 10 minutes. nothing overly wrong with this film, very little action for an action film. there was a chance to explore the characters emotions occasionally. whether an action film is the right genre to do that with, i'm still undecided. sniper was one of the easiest films to watch without giving full attention to, as it had little twists and a straightforward plot. i was probably guilty of that, so with a second watch or with undivided attention it may be better.  4/10 (but the best of my 4 out of 10's)",0
"the soloist has all ingredients to impress the academy. its director, joe wright, has already authored a best picture candidate. the leading actor, robert downey jr., starred in a widely praised superhero film. finally, the movie itself is a drama. when it was mysteriously pulled from release in late 2008, filmgoers and critics were baffled. now that i've seen it, i assure you universal didn't just delay this film to promote iron man-oscar buzz. the soloist is a weak drama with no external conflict that is vastly inferior to any 2009 best picture candidates.  downey and co-star jamie fox aren't to be blamed for this mishap. joe wright is largely at fault but even he can't save a lifetime story. many movies are too complex and alienate viewers. this one is unusually simple. it's a movie about a newspaper reporter, steve lopez (downey), who befriends a homeless musician, nathaniel ayers (jamie fox). that's it. ayers is schizophrenic and doesn't resonate with lopez's traditional approach to friendship. the two become friends. they begin this movie as acquaintances and are bffs by its end. tension consists of moments like this: will ayers let lopez take him to the homeless shelter? this material would have been better suited as a made-for-tv production rather than a feature film.  wright includes many scenes of cheap humor to obscure the lack of content. lopez battles yard-defiling raccoons in what i consider a sub-plot. do you remember when this happened in atonement or pride and prejudice? those films were structured enough to permit an occasional joke but nothing so prolonged. ayers' back story is fleshed out when it doesn't need to be. worst of all, these scenes are not connected and appear at random intervals. it's a way of admitting that the main story carries little appeal. nathaniel was a violin prodigy with a tough upbringing (i was too). this is a fabricated attempt to create sympathy with ayers when most of us already have it. he's a homeless schizophrenic for crying out loud! the movie somewhat conveys humanity's love for music, like amadeus and beethoven lives upstairs. it isn't as effective as either of those pictures, however. the entire film is hinged on ayers' schizophrenia. it ultimately is how he interacts with everyone else. his being a musician is a nice touch but hardly worth including. the film doesn't incorporate this characteristic fully into his persona. take music out of amadeus or beethoven lives upstairs, and no film remains. the soloist is more about friendship in general than music. nathaniel could be a writer or film critic and few lines of dialog would need to be seriously altered.  this is only joe wright's third film, and his first that isn't a romance staring keira knightley. let's hope this film isn't an indication of how limited his abilities are. there are stylistic nods to his earlier works but the soloist is much weaker than either of them. in his defense, universal should not have agreed to widely release this picture. this film seems tailored for imagine entertainment (distributors of changeling). i wouldn't be so disappointed with it if had a limited release. its poor box office performance may inhibit better dramas from being distributed nationally.",0
"ned kelly (ledger), the infamous australian outlaw and legend. sort of like robin hood, with a mix of billy the kid, australians love the legend of how he stood up against the english aristocratic oppression, and united the lower classes to change australia forever. the fact that the lower classes of the time were around 70% immigrant criminals seems to be casually skimmed around by this film. indeed, quite a few so called `facts' in this film are, on reflection, a tad dubious.  i suppose the suspicions should have been aroused when, in the opening credits, it was claimed that this film is based upon the book, `our sunshine'. if ever a romanticized version of truth could be seen in a name for a book, there it was. this wasn't going to be a historical epic, but just an adaptation of one of many dubious legends of ned kelly, albeit a harsh and sporadically brutal version.  unfortunately, ned kelly is nothing more than an overblown hallmark channel `real life historical drama' wannabe! the story plods along at an alarming rate (alarming because never has a film plodded so slowly!) the feeling of numbness after the two hours of pure drivel brought back memories of costner's awful wyatt earp all those years ago. simply put, nothing happens in the film, but it takes a long time getting to that nothing. this would possibly have been a tad more bearable if the performances were good (because the direction sure as heck wasn't). however, unless you are looking to play a game of spot the worst oirish accent, then you're gonna be disappointed. between that, the game of `who has the stupidest beard?', `spot the obvious backstabber!' (clue, they are all ginger for some reason), and `nature in australia.including lions', it is an experience similar to flicking through hallmark, the history channel, discovery channel, and neighbours whilst suffering a huge hangover. yup, nature pops up a lot, as to fill even more time (possibly an attempt to look arty), the film keeps showing pointless wildlife shots, and once all the native species are shown, here's a circus to allow for a camel and a lion (which is used during one fight to try to make us actually feel more sorry for the lion than the massacred people).  this is a turgid, emotionless piece of historical fluff which should have gone straight to tv. there isn't even one good word i can say about this film. even the usually fantastic rush seems embarrassed to be here. when one of the characters comments that there is only 2 bullets left for him and his pal, i myself was wishing i had a gun to blow any memory of this film out of my head!",0
"ringmaster, jerry springer's pathetic excuse for wasting film that should be recycled as toilet paper recently destroyed my confidence in the art of film. first of all, it was made. second of all, people went to see it. third, some people voted it the best movie they have ever seen. if a monkey could make a movie, i'm 100 percent sure that it would be 1 billion times as good. most crappy movies have their moments, (even godzilla had a few cool special effects) this film's moment was when i left the theater nauseated. the only thing that possibly could've made this movie any worse would be if jerry springer was the star. if i want to stare at crap for an hour and a half, i'll take a dump in a can. if anyone didn't utterly despise this movie, i pity you, and your children, and your children's children's children; however, contrary to springer's beliefs, i clearly don't condone children having sex.",0
"oh dear. i was so disappointed that this movie was just a rip-off of japan's ringu. well, i guess the u.s. made their version of it as well, but at least it was an outright remake. so, so sad. i very much enjoy watching filipino movies and know some great things can come out of such a little country, so i can't believe this had to happen. claudine and kris are such big names there, surprised they would be affiliated with plagiarism. to any aspiring movie makers out there in the philippines: you do not have to stoop this low to make money. there are many movie buffs that are watching the movies filipinos put out and enjoying them!",0
"the more i analyze this film, the worse it becomes. first of all, why a motivational speaker? that part was just stupid. i mean, why would a megalomaniac trying to control the world rely on a motivational speaker? is alexander stone really that disorganized? first he can't decide what he wants to do to control the world, so he looks to the bible for ideas. many of these ideas, i might add, really have no reliability(for example, the part of the ""the houses of ishmael and isaac shall scream out in terror"" could have already happened. it could have been have been the synagogues burned during krystalnacht and the mosques could very well have been the mosques blown up in baghdad or something.) and gillen lane's family! they had no part except to provide a family values platfrom and dab their eyes with water! i might add that since casper van dien/gillen lane is only in his twenties(or that's the impression that i had)and has a ten year child, he had his child during high school. yeah, there goes tbn's family values. also, why did this film have to be so damn propaganda-like? i'll repeat what an earlier reviewer said. the indiana jones flicks use christian mythology as a plot dvice and manipulate it well so that we are intoxicated. this film doesn't do that. the beginnig starts off well, with michael ironsides playing a priest who murders a scholar off some sort and steals the dead guy's omega code. then when confronted by two men who he is obviously afraid of, the two prophets tell him ""tell your master that we are here!"". dominic(ironsides) replies ""he already knows"" and points to a small surveillance camera. that part sent chills up my spine. had only it gone on like that one scene i would have loved this film. i'll give michael york credit: he does a fine job of acting out his character, as does michael ironsides. but the good guys are horrible. i've already went on about lane's family  . now that i'm over the acting, i'll get on to plot. this is obviously a baptist film, since our beloved pope of the vatican is portrayed as an oaf. the world domination plot i liked and found plausible and subtle, as were the action sequences were also thrilling and well-done. also another diatribe against the vatican, their leaders are seen as dogmatically minded, since gillen explains to the pope that it's not the end of the world, but the beginning of a new one also, the vatican (or israelis)says their going to secede from the world union aince they used the omega code to control the world. whoever it was, they wouldn't just secede, they'd send over commandoes and kill them. this is the equivalent of america knowing about the kgb going to kill the president and simply saying ""we're not going to talk to you any more!"". come on! i did enjoy the scenes where we see bombers headed towards israel and see them again on the monitor. mediocre in short.",0

"luckily, not knowing anything about this movie i was curious enough to tape it from tv. and then the tape ran out just five minutes before the ending!  but i'm glad i managed to get most of it because this is a really great spy movie. there are the usual toy submarines and a bit foggy plots, but also very chilling and even daring moments. considering the production year 1969, the certain slight lesbian overtones must have raised a few eyebrows. of course now it doesn't surprise anyone and those scenes in fact seem pretty beautifully done. and it's not just because of the two george's actresses.  the gas attack seems to hit every viewer very strongly, no wonder, and it certainly did hit me. very effective. also the viewpoints from the both sides of the opponents gives the whole story more deepness along the usual suspense and action. this is not just a heroic war tale of one victorious side, but shows what lies behind the victory in good and bad. well, being a case of war, mostly bad.  for the fans of composer ennio morricone this is also a must. his work is always excellent, touching but never over the top. and i think i have to try to catch more movies with suzy kendall. talk about fräulein! let's hope they get this on dvd soon, so i can have the entire movie in my collection and more people will become familiar with this very little known gem.",1
"halfway through lajos koltai's ""evening,"" a woman on her deathbed asks a figure appearing in her hallucination: ""can you tell me where my life went?"" the line could be embarrassingly theatrical, but the woman speaking it is vanessa redgrave, delivering it with utter simplicity, and the question tears your heart out.  time and again, the film based on susan minot's novel skirts sentimentality and ordinariness, it holds attention, offers admirable performances, and engenders emotional involvement as few recent movies have. with only six months of the year gone, there are now two memorable, meaningful, worthwhile films in theaters, the other, of course, being sara polley's ""away from her."" hollywood might have turned ""evening"" into a slick celebrity vehicle with its two pairs of real-life mothers and daughters - vanessa redgrave and natasha richardson, and meryl streep and mamie gummer. richardson is redgrave's daughter in the film (with a sister played by tony collette), and gummer plays streep's younger self, while redgrave's youthful incarnation is claire danes.  add glenn close, eileen atkins, hugh dancy, patrick wilson, and a large cast - yes, it could have turned into a multiple star platform. instead, koltai - the brilliant hungarian cinematographer of ""mephisto,"" and director of ""fateless"" - created a subtle ensemble work with a ""continental feel,"" the story taking place in a high-society newport environment, in the days leading up to a wedding that is fraught with trouble.  missed connections, wrong choices, and dutiful compliance with social and family pressures present quite a soap opera, but the quality of the writing, koltai's direction, and selfless acting raise ""evening"" way above that level, into the the rarified air of english, french (and a few american) family sagas from a century before its contemporary setting.  complex relationships between mothers and daughters, between friends and lovers, with the addition of a difficult triangle all come across clearly, understandably, captivatingly. individual tunes are woven into a symphony.  and yet, with the all the foregoing emphasis on ensemble and selfless performances, the stars of ""evening"" still shine through, redgrave, richardson, gummer (an exciting new discovery, looking vaguely like her mother, but a very different actress), danes carrying most of the load - until streep shows up in the final moments and, of course, steals the show. dancy and wilson are well worth the price of admission too.  as with ""away from her,"" ""evening"" stays with you at length, inviting a re-thinking its story and characters, and re-experiencing the emotions it raises. at two hours, the film runs a bit long, but the way it stays with you thereafter is welcome among the many movies that go cold long before your popcorn.",1
"i have this film out of the library right now and i haven't finished watching it. it is so bad i am in disbelief. audrey hepburn had totally lost her talent by then, although she'd pretty much finished with it in 'robin and marian.' this is the worst thing about this appallingly stupid film. it's really only of interest because it was her last feature film and because of the dorothy stratten appearance just prior to her homicide.  there is nothing but idiocy between gazzara and his cronies. little signals and little bows and nods to real screwball comedy of which this is the faintest, palest shadow.  who could believe that there are even some of the same manhattan environs that hepburn inhabited so magically and even mythically in 'breakfast at tiffany's' twenty years earlier? the soundtrack of old sinatra songs and the gershwin song from which the title is taken is too loud and obvious--you sure don't have to wait for the credits to find out that something was subtly woven into the cine-musique of the picture to know when the songs blasted out at you.  'reverting to type' means going back up as well as going back down, i guess. in this case, audrey hepburn's chic european lady is all you see of someone who was formerly occasionally an actress and always a star. here she has even lost her talent as a star. if someone whose talent was continuing to grow in the period, like ann-margret, had played the role, there would have been some life in it, even given the unbelievably bad material and mongoloid-level situations.  hepburn was a great person, of course, greater than most movie stars ever dreamed of being, and she was once one of the most charming and beautiful of film actors. after this dreadful performance, she went on to make an atrocious tv movie with robert wagner called 'love among thieves.' in 'they all laughed' it is as though she were still playing an ingenue in her 50's. even much vainer and obviously less intelligent actresses who insisted upon doing this like lana turner were infinitely more effective than is hepburn. turner took acting seriously even when she was bad. hepburn doesn't take it seriously at all, couldn't be bothered with it; even her hair and clothes look tacky. her last really good work was in 'two for the road,' perhaps her most perfect, if possibly not her best in many ways.  and that girl who plays the country singer is just sickening. john ritter is horrible, there is simply nothing to recommend this film except to see dorothy stratten, who was truly pretty. otherwise, critic david thomson's oft-used phrase 'losing his/her talent' never has made more sense.  ben gazarra had lost all sex appeal by then, and so we have 2 films with gazarra and hepburn--who could ask for anything less? sandra dee's last, pitiful film 'lost,' from 2 years later, a low-budget nothing, had more to it than this. at least ms. dee spoke in her own voice; by 1981, audrey hepburn's accent just sounded silly; she'd go on to do the pbs 'gardens of the world with audrey hepburn' and there her somewhat irritating accent works as she walks through english gardens with aristocrats or waxes effusively about 'what i like most is when flowers go back to nature!' as in naturalized daffodils, but in an actual fictional movie, she just sounds ridiculous.  to think that 'breakfast at tiffany's' was such a profound sort of light poetic thing with audrey hepburn one of the most beautiful women in the world--she was surely one of the most beautiful screen presences in 'my fair lady', matching garbo in several things and delphine seyrig in 'last year at marienbad.' and then this! and her final brief role as the angel 'hap' in the spielberg film 'always' was just more of the lady stuff--corny, witless and stifling.  i went to her memorial service at the fifth avenue presbyterian church, a beautiful service which included a boys' choir singing the shaker hymn 'simple gifts.' the only thing not listed in the program was the sudden playing of hepburn's singing 'moon river' on the fire escape in 'breakfast at tiffany's,' and this brought much emotion and some real tears out in the congregation.  a great lady who was once a fine actress (as in 'the nun's story') and one of the greatest and most beautiful of film stars in many movies of the 50's and 60's who became a truly bad one--that's not all that common. and perhaps it is only a great human being who, in making such things as film performances trivial, nevertheless has the largeness of mind to want to have the flaws pointed out mercilessly--which all of her late film work contained in abundance. most of the talk about hepburn's miscasting is about 'my fair lady.' but the one that should have had the original actress in it was 'wait until dark,' which had starred lee remick on broadway. never as celebrated as hepburn, she was a better actress in many ways (hepburn was completely incapable of playing anything really sordid), although hepburn was at least adequate enough in that part. after that, all of her acting went downhill.",0
"i bought this dvd for £1 and now i realise why. the acting was the worst i've seen in a long time. the lighting and sound are shoddy at best. the plot makes little sense even when sober (warning: i don't advise watching this film when sober.) this film feels like you're watching the home movie of someone who doesn't get out much. it really is a shame that all the very little money spent on this project went to such a waste, i look forward to seeing if any of those envoled still have a career, other than eva longoria who is the only ""star"" of this film that was apparently not hit with the bad acting stick. i'm sorry that none of this criticism seems constructive but i will say one thing to james cahill, don't try it again. in the words of squirlyem ""its severely lacking in the good department"".",0
"this movie is definately one of my favourite movies in it's kind. the interaction between respectable and morally uncorruptable characters is an ode to chivalry and the honour code amongst thieves and policemen. it treats themes like duty, guilt, word, manipulation and trust like few films have done and, unfortunately, none that i can recall since the death of the 'policial' in the late seventies. the sequence is delicious, down to the essential, living nothing out and thus leading the spectator into a masterful plot right and wrong without accessory eye catching and spectacular scenes that are often needed in lesser specimens of the genre in order to keep the audience awake. no such scenes are present or needed. the argument is flowless and honest to the spectator, wich is an important asset in a genre in wich the the suspense is often achieved through the betrail of the audience. no, this is not miss marble... a note of congratulations for the music is in order a film to watch and savour every minute, not just to see.",1
"clara lago is wonderful as the title character of the film, essentially a film about a spanish/american girl who moves to spain with her mom at the time of the spanish civil war. it turns out, the mother goes home to die, and she is left with her grandfather. she also makes friends and experiences much in a short time. tomiche (juan jose ballestra) is at first a nuisance to her then they become close. the film is shot beautifully, bathed in soft colors mostly. carol yearns for her dad, who is a pilot in the war, and you can feel the love sher has for him. while the war itself is kind of taken a back seat in this film, it envelops the character's lives. i think you'll like it. see it especially for clara lago, who does a great job as carol. she is definitely one to watch.",1
"isn't anyone else tired of that old cliché' where a nearly dead person shows up in a horror film, gives us some informations, and then blasts his head off for no apparent reason? i know i am.  the sad thing is that it's use in this film is worthless. if you have seen the first film (the first remake i should say) then the information given is completely worthless, because you would have already known it. i guess, you can that it isn't worthless to the main characters..but then why does the idiot shoot himself in the head? wouldn't he want to live? sure, he would have died anyway..  this is the second film to be titled ""the hills have eyes ii."" the first being the sequel to the original 70's film. this is where it gets a little complicated for someone like me. see, i'm probably part of minority of people my age that even knew there was a hhe2 to begin with, much less an original hhe1. and now that we have a sequel to a remake and the fact that this sequel is named exactly as the sequel to the original hhe1...it just makes it worse! but anyways..  wes craven's original hills have eyes was decent. in the end, though, the idea was better than the presentation, but he most likely had a low budget. to be quite honest, wes craven isn't that good of a horror director. he's only made a few good horror movies (nightmare on elm st., new nightmare), a few alright ones (scream) and a bunch of horrible ones (cursed, shocker, vampire in brooklyn). oh yeah, and he made swamp thing, as well...but the original hhe2 falls under the latter category. i've only seen a few minutes, but it was terrible.  now he has co-written the new hhe2..and it's such a disappointment! last year's hhe remake was even better than the original film. it was tense. i guess it had to do with the fact that the main characters were a family, and not a bunch of beer and pot and sex crazy teenagers. it made us feel dirty. for the first hour, we were in hell, and finally in the last few moments, the good guys got revenge on the bad guys and it felt good..  this new film has no tension. no suspense whatsoever. just violent things happening to mostly stupid people. there is hardly any menacing presence here. just ugly hobos hiding under rocks.  i'm getting tired of horror movies where people die because of the stupid mistakes they keep making. it was just the other day that i watching ""deep blue sea"" where samuel l. jackson kept on walking around the water, while giving the speech, and then he gets eaten by a shark, only because the idiot stayed to close to the water..something that nobody would do in the given situation! here is the exact same thing. people go off by themselves to take a leak even though they know people are dying..seriously, couldn't a potty break wait? and then when you think people would have learned, someone else goes of by themselves! seriously, isn't more scary when the characters are bringing their a-game and still losing? i would think so...  it even under delivers. it should have made the first remake look like ""the fog"" remake (which was less menacing than an episode of ""becker""). more bad guys. more time in the caves. more tension. more of everything.  but it actually downgrades. less bad guys. no tension. sure we have more time in the caves, but not a whole lot happens there. in the end, it only seems like there is two or three bad guys. the last film made it seem like a whole tribe of people. where is this tribe? who keeps on watching them through binoculars? seriously, these are the things this film should have brought us, but it ends with the exact same promise that the last film gave us, with that exact same ""being watched"" scene. come on! i'll give the devil it's due. the look of the film is good..but thats it.  i don't even think fans of gore will like this..though i'm probably wrong! there is gore (though most of it is sped-up while in the dark), but without the tension, and characters you even care about..the gore does nothing in my book! in the end, you're not frightened. you;re not shocked (unless you're an 8 year old girl). you don't even feel like you have seen anything new.",0
"there are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them. this film shows it as it is. it is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy, it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful. i've only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel. it is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop. this is what films should be about- they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong.",1
"i must admit that at the beginning, i was sort of reticent about watching this movie. i thought it was this stupid, little, romantic film about a french woman who meets in the train an american and decides to visit vienna with him. i was not actually enchanted about this kind of script, since it continued to make me believe that it is just a movie. still, i watched it! and i was amazed...""before sunrise"" is one of the few films who dare to talk in a rather philosophical way, wondering about the fact that in the moment of our birth, we are sentenced to death, or that it is a middling idea that fact that a couple should rest together for eternity, or that, we, humans, can afford sometimes to live in fairy-tales.   the ending was wonderfully chosen (we do not know if they will meet again in six months, at six o'clock, in vienna's station) -in our optimism, we sincerely hope so. the actors acted in a very good manner, so, that, i began to believe that i, myself could live a love-story just like this.",1

"a small funny film. it is totally incredible, unbelievable, impossible. but it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized, even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms. of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the internet. you must not believe ten percent of what you're told there and never, ever, ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally. most of their ""businesses"" there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you. but here the chap deserves being the victim of such gangsters because he is not only naive, he is absurdly silly. but then the film becomes funny because it ends up with the victim of the crooked business having the upper hand and ending up playing the same game with his victimizer and winning. one think is sure too. security in english airports is not exactly what it should be, but i guess it's not better anywhere else in the world and even now they have tightened up all rules and regulations it is just fun to go through their procedures and foil them systematically. then they have their vengeance by losing your luggage, a real plague on modern airports, and don't expect to get fair compensation. or even confiscating a bottle opener or a can opener because it may be dangerous. i can see myself cutting my way through the side of the plane with a can opener. funny, isn't it? dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines",1
"i should explain why i gave this...""piece of art"" 1 star rating out of possible 10. simply because it's hard or next to impossible to rate it unbiased. probably it would have been the same if i had given it 10/10 - explanations anyway would have followed.  i am not fond of these pointless gore movies like hostel or so - i think that's disgusting and pretty terrible (in all the possible contextual meanings), but as i found out after watching this movie - there is a genre called ""historical drama"" - and probably it would have been the case of 10/10 as it has plenty of it and tarantino would have been more than happier with it (and made kill bill 3 to spill even more blood on screen than here to show that it is possible). but the thing about ""historical drama"" genre is that it's a sub-category of the ""trash movies"" where john romero is the undead-gory-emperor-of-the-guts and so automatically it can't be rated as your default movie - as these are movies that are made bad on purpose and you can't really tell whether the comically bad moment was meant to be so, or it was simply bad. it's for the people who like to enjoy bad acting, bad screenplay and bad everything else. and by some turn of faith - i am one of them too. there are days when i have an urge of seeing a really bad movie and look up for some trash and here you go - the day is saved! but that's definitely an opinion of mine and doesn't have match with anyones' else.  what i wanted to say is that if you want to watch some terrible movie - then fellini's casanova is definitely the choice, but heed my advice and don't rate it by default means.",0
"way, way back in the 1980s, long before nafta was drafted and corporations began to shed their national identities, the united states and japan were at each other's throat in the world manufacturing race. remember sayings like 'union yes!,' 'the japanese are taking this country over,' and 'americans are lazy?'  as the reagan era winded down and corporations edged towards a global marketplace, director ron howard made one of several trips into the comedy genre with his 1986 smash 'gung ho,' which drew over $36 million in u.s. box office receipts. while in many ways dated, howard's tongue-in-cheek story of colliding cultures in the workplace still offers hard truth for industrial life today.  'gung ho' focuses on hunt stevenson (michael keaton), the automakers union rep from hadleyville, a small, depressed town in the foothills of pennsylvania. stevenson has been asked to visit the assan motor company in tokyo (similar to real-life toyota), which is considering a u.s. operation at the town's empty plant. with hundreds of residents out of work and the town verging on collapse, assan decides to move in and stevenson is hired as a liaison between company officials and workers on the assembly line.  the 112 minutes of 'gung ho' is a humorous look at these two sides, with their strengths and weaknesses equally considered: on one hand, an american workforce that values its traditions but is often caught in the frenzy of pride and trade unionism; on the other hand, japanese workers who are extremely devoted to their job yet lacking in personal satisfaction and feelings of self-worth. in stevenson, we find an american working class figure of average intelligence with the skills to chat people through misunderstandings. with the survival of his workers' jobs and most of hadleyville on the line, stevenson proves a likable guy who wants nothing more than a fair chance, although his cleverness will sink him into a great deal of trouble. besides answering to the heads of assan, we witness a delicate balancing act between stevenson and his fellow union members, many of whom he grew up with. this includes buster (george wendt), willie (john turturro), and paul (clint howard, ron's brother).  the japanese cast is headed by gedde watanabe, also known for 'sixteen candles' and 'volunteers.' watanabe plays kazihiro, the plant manager who is down on his luck and begins to feel a sympathy for american life. he is constantly shadowed by saito (sab shimono), the nephew of assan's ceo who is desperate to take his spot in the pecking order. while given a light touch, these characters fare very well in conveying ideas of the japanese working culture.  with hunt stevenson dominating the script, michael keaton has to give a solid performance for this film to work. 'gung ho' is indeed a slam-dunk success for keaton, who also teamed with ron howard in 1994's 'the paper.' he made this film during a string of lighter roles that included 'mr. mom,' 'beetle juice,' and 'the dream team' before venturing into 'batman,' 'one good cop,' and 'my life.' it's also hard not to like gedde watanabe's performance as the odd man out, who first wears japanese ribbons of shame before teaming up with stevenson to make the auto plant a cohesive unit.  the supporting cast is top-notch, including wendt, turturro, shimono, and soh yamamura as assan ceo sakamoto. mimi rogers supplies a romantic interest as audrey, hunt's girlfriend. edwin blum, lowell ganz, and babaloo mandel teamed up for gung ho's solid writing. the incidental music, which received a bmi film music award, was composed by thomas newman. gung ho's soundtrack songs are wall-to-wall 80s, including 'don't get me wrong,' 'tuff enuff,' and 'working class man.'  the success of 'gung ho' actually led to a short-lived tv series on abc. while more impressive as a social commentary twenty years ago, ron howard's film still has its comic value. it is available on dvd as part of the paramount widescreen collection and is a tad short-changed. audio options are provided in english 5.1 surround, english dolby surround, and french 'dubbing,' but subtitles are in english only. there are no extras, not even the theatrical trailer. on the plus side, paramount's digital transfer is quite good, with little grain after the opening credits and high quality sound. while a few extras would have been helpful - especially that 'gung ho' was a box office success - there's little to complain about the film presentation itself.  *** out of 4",1
"this interesting feature has a very fine story-line, rather colorful characters and a very steady pace. it also incorporates a plot device from ""reap the wild wind"", and since cecil b. deille directed that and his son-in-law anbthony quinn directed this film from his preparations, that can hardly be a coincidence. it works in both cases, i must report. the unusual set-up tells the viewer that barataria, an island ruled by jean lafitte is built upon piracy, but during the war of 1812, and before, he has always refrained from bothering united states' vessels. now general andrew jackson has been charged with defending nearby new orleans with only 12,000 men against 60,000 british imperial redcoats and 60 ships. lafitte's men want him to side with the stronger force; he wants freedom and pardons for his men before ceding such a strategic landing spot to the u.s. forces. there are other factors at work in the story-line; pirate bonnie brown and her father want to attack u.s. ships and do so in defiance of lafitte's orders, leaving a boy alive without knowing they have missed an eyewitness. when his testimony finally comes out, jackson cannot grant what lafitte asks; but lafitte supports him anyway and in the fog, the pirates and jackson rout the british and he sails away to whatever destiny awaits a man who had genius and statesmanship but not fortune. the cast of this colorful and physically-lovely film are skilled indeed. yul brynner has one of his best roles as the pirate king, inger stevens is beautiful; as the girl he loves, charles boyer has many good lines as his adviser, powerful lorne greene is a rival, e.g. marshall the governor, and claire bloom is charismatic as bonnie brown. others in the cast include ted de corsia, douglass dumbrille, george mathews, henry hull as jackson's adviser, bruce gordon, onslow stevens, robert f. simon, henry brandon, fran jeffries, and leslie bradley, among others. the music by elmer bernstein is very memorable, and the 1938 script remade here had only to be freshened a bit. the shiny cinematography was the work of veteran loyal griggs, the set decoration was supplied by albert nozaki, hal pereira and walter tyler, with set decoration by sam comer and roy moyer and costumes by edith head, john jensen and ralph jester. nellie manley did the elaborate hairstyles and wally westmore the difficult makeup. the film contains quite a bit of good adventure-level dialogue and a very strong climactic battle scene. charlton heston, as as andrew jackson, prepared to play the part of an elder general and then discovered the man was young at the time of the battle; but he is often effective, grey-haired or not, especially in his exchanges with henry hull as mr. peavey. this is an exciting and well-mounted entertainment, which looks exactly as if c.b. demille had completed his production; it is a beautiful and nearly a very-fine motion picture.",1
"the only thing that kept me from vomiting after seeing this movie was the fact that these are just actors and not the freak show that usually appears on the tv show. this is also the main reason that fans of the tv show won't like the movie, but not the only reason. this movie has about as much entertainment value as getting a root canal. it approaches the abyssmal depths of bad movie making, and then gets even worse. i won't waste your time describing this movie in further detail; suffice it to say that i pity the poor camera people who had to suffer through watching this c**p the first time.",0

"having read some of the other comments here i was expecting something truly awful but was pleasantly surprised. reality check: the original series wasn't that good. i think some people remember it with more affection than it deserved but apart from the car chases and daisy duke's legs the scripts were weak and poorly acted. the duke boys were too intelligent and posh for backwood hicks, the shrunken boss hog was too cretinous to be evil and rosco was just hyper throughout every screen moment. it's amazing the series actually lasted as long as it did because it ran out of story lines during the first series.  back to the movie. if you watch this film in it's own right, not as a direct comparison to however you remember the tv series, then it's not bad at all. the real star is of course the general lee. the car chases and stunts are excellent and that's really what d.o.h. is all about. johnny knoxville is his usual eccentric self and along with seann william scott as cousin bo the pair make this film really funny in a hilarious dumb-and-dumber sort of way the tv series never achieved. the lovely jessica simpson is a natch as miss daisy, burt reynolds makes a much improved boss hog and m.c. gainey makes a believably nasty rosco p. coltrane, the way he always should have been.  if you don't like slapstick humour and crazy car stunts then you wouldn't be watching this film anyway because you should know what to expect. otherwise if you want an entertaining car-action movie with a few good laughs that's not too taxing on the brain then go see this enjoyable romp with an open mind.",1
"lee hosted the 100 years of horror for ted newsom and was talking about filmic werewolves. he said something to the effect that his only brush with lycanthropy was the howling ii, then he quipped, ""the less said about that the better."" indeed he was right as this film may very well be the worst in his entire catalog of screen performances. the first howling by joe dante was a groundbreaking werewolf film with its incredible special effects and its campy sense of style and subject matter. it was a film to be taken seriously. like other good original films, filmmakers for some strange reason thought that even more campy sequels were needed rather than what worked the first time(see chud then chud ii to illustrate this point). this film is miles and miles away from the first on every front. there is absolutely nothing scary about it. it looks cheap and is pitch black through most of the major scenes. lee is the only actor in the film worth mentioning(okay, i'll cede ferdy mayne too). lee looks embarrassed as he says inane dialog and does ridiculous things(check out that ending with him and stirba). lee looks incredibly tired and knows what dreck this is which is a tad more insightful than the two leads who leave america to go to romania. the story isn't really worth examining here, and you can bet there is very little story worth mentioning when you have to have stephen parsons and his band babel play through much of the film in the beginning and the ending with that dreadful noise. sybil danning is here and, yes, she disrobes once and then we get that scene showed again and again and again - one reviewer said 17 times(i counted ten - but might have been so bored out of my mind by that point). i gave the film three stars, but it really deserves a zero - the three i gave it are 1 for lee and two for ms. danning's contributions. yuck!",0
"in the year 1985 (my birth year) steven spielberg directed an emotionally strong and unforgettable story of a young african-american girl celie (debut role for whoopi goldberg) whose life is followed through rough times. the story begins from the year 1909 when celie is only 14 years old. she has given birth two children for her father. celie has a younger sister nettie with whom she is inseparable. a widower lays his eyes on nettie but their father gives celie to him. it is the beginning of an era of horrible abuse and constant controlling. women are inferior of men and especially being an african-american woman their rights are less than a zero. celie's story is a true survival story.  ""the color purple"" is a master-piece and underestimated film of spielberg. he should make more drama which ""the color purple"" and ""schindler's list"" are good notion.  the cast is amazing. whoopi goldberg is known better as a ravingly funny comedienne but the introducing role as celie is a remarkable word that she really can pull of heavy drama. danny glover was surprisingly nasty ""mister"". i have never seen him in a such an evil role. the talk-show icon oprah winfrey is brilliant as a strong-willed sofia.  warning! prepare to have a number of tissues with you when watching this film. you can really connect to the story of the strong sisterhood. especially if you have as close relationship with your siblings like i have with my sister.  big applauds to mr. spielberg!",1
"a few years ago, a friend got from one of his other friends a video with the michael mann film 'heat' on it. after we finished that movie, and were about to stand up, we saw that there is another film just after, tough on the cassette's envelope the owner didn't write it up. yet we were all glued back to our seats by its distinct opening, which lacked credits.  some two hours later, i just sat there wondering: how could i not have heard of this masterpiece before?...  this film was europa. lars von trier woke film noir from the dead, deconstructed reality with intentionally obvious sets, yet often there was haunting similarity with post-war german photographs i saw. and then the tricky cuts!  the story itself is a hard-to-take moral odyssey that has no happy end. a young american pacifist of german descent comes to post-war germany, intent on doing some good to pay for the bombs his countrymen dropped. but he mostly meets distrust and self-destructive defiance. he hires with zentropa, a dining-and-sleeping-car company (modeled on mitropa), whose owner is one of the nazi collaborators the occupiers whitewash. our hero falls in love with his daughter - who later turns out to be a member of the werewolf, nazi post-war terrorists. when he doesn't understand the world (or just europeans) anymore, in his rage he blows up a railroad bridge under a train which he just saved.  as a final note, for historical correctness: in the real world, the werewolf were nowhere as important as the film implies, they were mostly a final nazi propaganda coup. after an ss unit assassinated the major of allied-occupied aachen, two months before the capitulation, the nazis announced the creation of whole legions of saboteurs and terrorists who will be ready to fight behind the lines, the werewolf. but only a few hundred of mostly hitler youth received some training, and while two or three times some were deployed to murder suspected communists or forced-labourer foreigners in bavarian villages to imprint lasting fear on inhabitants, with hitler's death and the war's end it all fell apart.  however, the werewolf propaganda had a profound effect on the occupiers. they feared the werewolf everywhere, suspected it behind any serious accident - but without exception another cause was found later (ignored by some recent pseudo-historians). for example, when a gas main exploded in the police hq of bombed-out bremen, or when the soviet military commander died in a motorbike accident in berlin. the effect was strongest on the soviets, who arrested tens of thousands (in large part children!) 'preemptively' on suspicion of being werewolf, and closed them off in prison camps where a lot of them died.",1

"this film breeches the fine line between satire and silliness. while a bridge system that has no rules may promote marital harmony, it certainly can't promote winning bridge, so the satire didn't work for me. but there were some items i found enjoyable anyway, especially with the big bridge match between paul lukas and ferdinand gottschalk near the end of the film. it is treated like very much like a championship boxing match. not only is the arena for the contest roped off in a square area like a boxing ring, there is a referee hovering between the contestants, and radio broadcaster roscoe karns delivers nonstop chatter on the happenings. at one point he even enumerates ""one... two... three... four..."" as though a bid of four diamonds was a knockdown event. and people were glued to their radios for it all, a common event for championship boxing matches. that spoof worked very well indeed.  unfortunately, few of the actors provide the comedy needed to sustain the intended satire. paul lukas doesn't have much of a flair for comedy and is miscast; lovely loretta young and the usual comic frank mchugh weren't given good enough lines; glenda farrell has a nice comic turn as a forgetful blonde at the start of the film, but she practically disappears thereafter. what a waste of talent!",0

"a case of being in the right place at the right time. what a fascinating film. it is easy to see why chavez is so popular with his people. he gets things done. he is accessible. and it is also easy to see why the west hates him so much. he has control of the resources of his country and gives the profits back to the people. mostly the poor. and it easy to see how the tv stations can portray misleading images to put there case. just like the iraq war, or the war on terror. or those missing wmd's. or how about the axis of evil. people need to wake up. and get different points of view. stop the neo cons ruling the world. go watch this movie with an open mind. and make your own mind up. then i suggest you see aaron russo's: america: freedom to fascism. it is not the people of america that are the problem. it is the government.",1
"you can't hold too much against this knowing that it was made in four days, and i had expected it to be campy anyway. (it's not all that campy in reality. with the exception of kevin kalisher and huntley ritter, who don't take themselves seriously, the rest of the cast plays it halfway straight; riley smith is exceptionally bad.) the ridiculous story is actually paid attention to, which kind of shocked me; i assumed the whole purpose with these ultra-low-budget horror movies was to cater to the basest sexual fantasies and not give a damn about the story, but they use lots of words like ""technological"" and ""physicality"" in the script to get their point across. (although it's possible that the story is important only to explain why there's so few cast members.) nobody cares about this stupid storyline, and the only things that are interesting in the film are the mocking of cults and the soft-core homoeroticisms (which aren't all that edgy). i would have enjoyed it more if there were just some random killings for no reason. the film is grainy, with a tv-quality look and acting level. there are a few ""sexy"" scenes that are alright -- the boys writhing in bed in their boxers, feeling themselves up; or being tied down and making orgasmic faces while wine is poured on them -- and some of them are kinda funny. and i liked the digs at l. ron hubbard and the intended irony of a story about religious cultists told with intense gay overtones, but it still isn't any good. 3/10",0
"well, it was funny in spots. this film is a 4 or maybe a 3. its a film that sits on the video shelf and gathers dust. rent this one after you seen everything else. beats boredom, but not by that much. my wife like like this film better then i do, maybe its not that bad.",0
"  as with the other episodes in this made-for-tv series expanding on the many adventures of the sea legend, horatio hornblower's super human infallibility ruins all chance for suspense.  as little wesley crusher ruined many seasons of the next generation, horatio hornblower invincibly saves every situation. each and every clever solution inevitably comes only from the lips of horatio hornblower. immeasurably superior, hornblower's main trouble in this movie series seems to be tolerating the many error ridden characters above and below him in the chain of command. a perfect being makes for dull story telling. so superior is our hero, that even those who attempt to help him are powerless to do something correctly unless hornblower is there to direct and control their every move.  what is the sense in telling a story about any person who cannot do wrong and will repeatedly win at everything every single time? what is the point of watching such a story?",0
"i have seen it. it's not ""good"" but interesting in an understated way. the boys in it are quite naturalistic but................the graphic/gratuitous final gang rape scene is repugnant and -oh yes- the arbitrary insertion of second world war footage is offensive in the way it attempts to compare real horror with this misogynistic contrivance. real atrocity is real- this film is just atrocious. however, the film has a look which can draw you in. but it seems to me that is the ""emperor's new clothes"", but in fact in reverse. the film looks good, but the direction, story, content and final feeling you take away from this film is vacuous. if a feeling can be vacuous-this is it.",0

"before i begin, i want to briefly say that this movie in and of itself is very well made and well acted by all involved, including whittaker, who indeed deserves his nomination. it is highly entertaining, and . . . taken in the right context as a work of fiction, it is a very good movie. for that, i give it the two stars.  however, rather than wasting your time with what you can read a hundred times elsewhere, i want instead to point out the absolute fictional nature of this film and how dangerous it is to sell people a work of fiction as if it is truth. i stress that this film nowhere in the credits lets us know that the main character, dr. nicholas garrigan, is a complete invention of fiction. rather, it presents this character into a real historical setting, and allows the uninformed viewer to assume he was in fact real, and what they are seeing is the truth. i have no problem with the blending of fact and fiction - but to do so in such a dishonest matter is, in a word, reprehensible.  there can be no doubt that africa, along with most third world countries is rife with human misery and suffering. hollywood has long attempted to capture the suffering of people in these countries on film. but hollywood also has its eye toward making money. the only true way to capture the suffering that seems to happen everywhere but the west is to either experience it for yourself, or to at least have it captured in an honest documentary.  but these depictions of fictional characters in real historical settings can only do so much. at the end of the day, they become less about presenting the facts for the viewer to decide for himself, and more about leading you from image to image and hitting you over the head screaming, ""see, we told you it was bad!"" the seminal example of this can be found by anyone willing to watch the documentary on the dvd after sitting through the movie. arguably the most shocking image of the film is the viewing of the body of kay amin, idi's second wife, whom he killed when he discovered her infidelity. in the film, we see that her limbs have been severed and reattached in reverse (arms for legs and vice-versa). this is the director making sure you understand that amin is, as the gungans say, bom-bad! but watching the documentary, we learn that this is in fact nothing more than a myth, which the sitting minister of health at the time himself tells us is not true.  so . . . what . . . they just make up these things? why? because hollywood has a low opinion of our intelligence, that's why! they don't trust us to come to the right conclusion ourselves. look, that she was murdered and dismembered is in itself enough for us to conclude that amin was not the likable guy he portrayed to the media - we don't need this texas chainsaw massacre inspired imagery to reinforce that! and this is just the tip of the iceberg. what is also not explained to the casual viewer is that lead character garrigan is himself fictional. there was no young scottish doctor taken under amin's wing. as such, garrigan is clearly present only for the sake of helping us dumb westerners understand the african world. the producers seem to thing we won't be interested in a film about africa unless there is a white face in it. (ironically, even the titular character is portrayed by an american black actor!) the problem with this is that the movie is no longer an expose of amin and his regime, but instead an exploitative thriller about a white westerner coming to africa for all the wrong reasons, making several horrible mistakes, and then ""redeeming"" himself, even at the cost of three other innocent lives. honestly, i have to say it is nearly reprehensible to suggest that the real tragic death of mrs. amin was the result of a tryst with a fictional scottish doctor - it almost seems to become a morbid joke for the sake of entertainment! i really wish hollywood would stop jerking us around for our money. i first realized its propensity to do this with the woefully manipulative a beautiful mind, ron howard and akiva goldsman's sugary-sweet adaptation of the life of john nash, which deleted the darker side of the man to present only the tortured hero that america just can't get enough of. the sad truth is that hollywood has been selling us these fakes for years, and viewers, who are predictably and understandably too lazy or uncaring to investigate for themselves, buy these fake portraits hook, line, and sinker.  look, i'm certainly not suggesting amin is being turned into a villain he wasn't. my point is, with the truth being so shocking enough to convince us of the brutality of the man, why must hollywood then go to such fictional lengths? why must hollywood continue to insult us by holding our hands through these films? why can they not trust us to think for ourselves!? can we not just put the honest portrayals on screen and let the audience decide for themselves? i urge all who continue to watch hollywood's purportedly ""true"" movies to do yourself the favor of always investigating for yourself, and to never assume that what is on screen is even close to the truth!",0
"""house of games"" is definitely not without its flaws- plot holes, stiff acting, final scenes- but they do little to detract from the fun of watching a thriller that so methodically messes with your head. ""house of games"" does almost everything a good thriller is supposed to do. of course, this is not a huge feat given the fact that we're dealing with the the world of confidence men and the cons they perpetrate. so it stands to reason that we never really know what's going on, even though we think that we do. but that's what makes the film worthwhile for those who are game; a film for which repeated viewings are indulgences instead if necessities.  it has a definite hitchcock slant to it. the film draws on some similar themes found his 1964 effort ""marnie"", considered a misfire when released but now regarded as one of the master's more thought-provoking works. one could easily consider the idea of lindsay crouse's character being the same as tippi hedrin's...ten year later perhaps. both are strong-willed loners, both with compulsive behaviors which compel them to walk too close to the shark pool. as crouse's repressed, up-tight character says, ""what's life without adventure?"" put your reality check on a low setting and enjoy swimming with the sharks!",1
"if you want to be cynical and pedantic you could point out that the opening where a raf lancaster bomber is mortally wounded on the 2nd of may 1945 is somewhat unlikely since german air defences were as lively as adolph hitler on that day but this isn't a movie that should be viewed by a cynical audience and i guess a character being killed in literally the last hours of the war adds to the poignancy . in fact you'd have to have survived the second world war to fully appreciate the intellect , beauty and soul of powell and pressburger's masterpiece . the scenes of heaven are painfully twee when viewed today ? again you have to view the movie of the context when it was made . raf bomber command lost 58,000 men during the war , the same number that america lost in 'nam but during a shorter period and a far , far smaller pool of active combatants , there's no atheists in a fox hole and i doubt if you'd lost a relative during the conflict you'd view material atheism as being a sensible thing . when richar attenborough's young pilot looks down in awe at the sight below him many war heroes must have openly wept at this scene as they remembered much missed comrades who didn't survive the war . also bare in mind that despite losing several million people from 1939-45 there seems to be very few people from germany passing through the pearly gates . it's obvious nazis don't go to heaven   the plot itself where dashing young pilot peter carter arguing for his life in front of a celestial court wouldn't have had much appeal to me if it wasn't for the subtext , you see a matter or life and death is a highly political and visionary film that laments the end of the british empire as it's replaced by american ambitions . there's little things that show up the film as being made by people aware of american history and culture . one is the ethnic mix of america , even today many britons think that the usa is overwhelmingly composed of white anglo saxon protestants when in fact only 51% of americans are "" white european "" . the film rightly contains a scene where a multitude of different races confess "" i am an american "" as peter is judged by abraham farlan , an anglophobe who was the first revolutionary killed by british forces in the american war of independence . as for the "" special relationship "" between britain and america - what special relationship ? powell and pressburger know their history when it comes to britain and america . they obviously know their future too   so remember to watch this movie with some of your mind in the past and some of your mind in the present . it's strange , beautiful , poignant and clever but most of all it's a film that would never ever work if it were made in the last 40 years . can you imagine if the story was set in 2003 and revolved around a british soldier killed in iraq ?",1

"i watched the canadian videotape of this movie as ""the witching"" which somehow made its way to new york state. audio was quite bad, i had to raise it to about 7/8 just to hear it and the soundtrack often was overwhelming the dialog. orson welles was a mumbler, worse than usual, and some of his dialog and of others was run through an echo chamber. a ghostly figure who keeps reappearing had her voice distorted. some closed captions would really have helped!  a group of witches or satanists (the end credits say the group was not meant to represent any real group!) have a ritual in which they get naked and cause a miscarriage by stabbing a doll. the woman who had the miscarriage and her husband move to a town named ""lilith,"" where he's been offered a job at a toy factory. despite one of the akas of this movie apparently being ""the toy factory,"" we never see it, and it's only occasionally referred to at all.  on the way to lilith, her husband gets impatient with some of her questions about what his new boss mr. cato wanted to know about their religious persuasion. he drives aggressively, and causes another car to go off the road and blow up. after the police arrive, she takes a doll that fell out of the car, the second of many handmade dolls in the movie.  it turns out mr. cato and all the townspeople are witches, and that they are the ones who caused her miscarriage, though she doesn't realize it. they want her because she has an innate talent for necromancy, of which she was not really aware.  some images in the movie have some impact, but on the whole the movie is not very involving. the movie does seem a bit of a mess, and this is no doubt largely due to its re- editing and the addition of new footage. the original version, according to the end credits, was called necromancy - a life for a life. the magic of dvd could let us see both versions on one disc, but re-releasing this movie probably isn't a priority.",0

"yes i have rated this film as one star awful. yet, it will be in my rotation of christmas movies henceforth. this truly is so bad it's good. this is another k.gordon murray production (read: buys a really cheap/bad mexican movie, spends zero money getting it dubbed into english and releases it at kiddie matinées in the mid 1960's.) it's a shame i stumbled on this so late in life as i'm sure some ""mood enhancers"" would make this an even better experience. i'm not going to rehash what so many of the other reviewers have already said, a christmas movie with merlin, the devil, mechanical wind-up reindeer and some of the most pathetic child actors i have ever seen bar none. i plan on running this over the holidays back to back with kelsey grammar's ""a christmas carol"". truly a holiday experience made in hell. now if i can only find ""to all a goodnight (aka slayride)"" on dvd i'll have a triple feature that can't be beat. you have to see this movie. it moves so slowly that i defy you not to touch the fast forward button-especially on the two dance routines! this thing reeks like an expensive bleu cheese-guess you have to get past the stink to enjoy the experience. feliz navidad amigos!",0
"as if most people didn't already have a jittery outlook on the field of dentistry, this little movie will sure make you paranoid patients squirm. a successful dental hygienist witnesses his wife going down on the pool man (on their anniversary of all days!) and snaps big time into a furious breakdown. after shooting an attack dog's head off, he strolls into work and ends up taking his marital aggression out on the patients as he plans what to do about his ""slut"" of a wife. there are plenty of up-close shots of mouth-jabbing, tongue-cutting, and beauty queen fondling, as well as a marvelously deranged performance by corbin bernsen. the scene in which he ties up and gases his wife before mercilessly yanking her teeth out is definitely hard to watch. a dentist is absolutely the wrong kind of person to go off the deep end and this movie sure explains that in detail. ""the dentist"" is incredibly entertaining, fast-paced, and laughably gory at times. check it out!",1

"this has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an austen novel. although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular ""pride and prejudice,"" ""emma"" is a lush and relatively faithful tv version of austen's novel -- especially considering its short length. the biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one, as the unnecessary snobbishness that austen exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to emma's character in the rest of the book. i thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were well-picked. kate beckinsale walks the fine line between girlishness and the social snob with a grace completely lost in gwyneth paltrow's '96 version. samantha morton's wispy blonde locks suit her attitude and character as the simper that accompanies her role in previous characterisations is replaced with the harriet we know from the book. mister knightly's role is carried out extremely well in my opinion; both the seriousness and the gentle compassion that the hero is painted with in the novel are present here in this much-neglected, sumptuous film.",1
"this film is actually pertinent even today given the threat of bio-terrorism, and the threats of superbugs, west nile virus, and sars. as a thriller, the tension is fairly intense. richard widmark and paul douglas are more than serviceable in their roles. the domestic scenes between widmark and his wife provide a nice interlude to the main plot. the actor in this film who most left his mark is jack palance. his sharply defined features and seemingly easygoing exterior always wither way to reveal the avaricious and cruel man beneath the surface. the chase scene through the packing plant is impressive even today. recommended, 7/10.",1
"i was very excited when this series premiered in 2005. the premise was very simple and appealing: each episode would be a one-hour mini movie directed by a famous, noteworthy horror director. then, when i finally watched them it was a bit of a letdown. some good episodes emerged from that first season, but all in all it was a mixed bag. i attributed it to the learning curve, and figured that season 2 would be a whole lot better.  boy, was i in for a shock. at least season one had a few good stories here and there. season 2 (with the exception of ""the black cat"" starring the excellent jeffrey combs) was a complete and total loss to me. the episode ""sounds like"" may very well be the worst thing i have watched on tv in the last 10 years, and most of the other episodes aren't much better. i really hope that season 3 turns this around next year, but i'm not holding my breath.",0
"when i started watching this movie i saw the dude from buffy, xander, and figured ah how nice that he's still making a living acting in movies. now a weird movie i can stand, given that it's a good dose of weird like for example david lynch movies, twin peaks, lost highway etc. and you sort of have to be in the mood for one. this one however made me mockingly remember the crazy websites about there about conspiracy theory's that make absolutely no sense. i mean come on people nazi's who conspire with america to make an unholy trinity of evil powers? i was surprised they didn't mention the hollow earth in this movie with hitler flying saucers and lizard people. maybe if you had like 60 grams of heroine with this movie it would make some sort of sense, but seriously i don't condone drugs like i don't condone this movie. it should be burned, shredded and forgotten just so good ol' xander might get another acting job. it wasn't his acting though, that was alright, but the script just didn't make any sense. sorry.",0

"this series is one of the worst shows i have ever seen. terrible acting, terrible effects, terrible writing, you get my drift. the stories are so far from the legend of robin hood it's amazing. looks like they just wanted to use the name robin hood to attract an audience. it might as well have been called new adventures of mr. bland acting.  someone commented before me that if you had imagination, you'd love this show. that is a horrible approach to a tv-series. a visual media like this should spark your imagination, you shouldn't have to force your imagination into something to make it good. that would be like the simpsons episode where they try to brainwash homer with a religious propaganda movie, and he starts talking about who killed who or whatever. ""if a movie is boring, i just make up my own story.""  in conclusion: absolute human waste.",0

"anyone interested in pop music, and not familiar with british music trends of the late-seventies, should be sure to watch breaking glass at least once. the movie, about a young woman's quest to make her mark in the music world, captures the times perfectly, from the overt sexism, rough economic times, social upheaval, to the shift in pop culture from rough-and-tumble punk to terribly fey and pretentious futurism/new romanticism. the music and fashion styles created daily in britain in the late-seventies are still being rediscovered and recycled (there really has been nothing new since 1980). this was a dazzling time, and breaking glass both tells a very personal story and surveys the cultural landscape, and does both extremely well.",1
"my, how the mighty have fallen. kim basinger is a great actress but she was definitely slumming when she took this role. this movie is bad for one reason in particular: lapses in logic. its looks like one of those movies that would have been passable with all its plot holes if it had came out in the 80s and 90s but in 2008 it just looks real stupid. this is the worst thriller i've ever seen and i've seen the bone collector and twisted.  the story details della(kim basinger)is just getting from buying gifts in a mall an is harassed by a gang of thugs that end up killing a cop that came to her aid. from then on she is chased by these idiotic goons through an abandoned street and she gets rid of them one by one with a toolbox full of tools.  so many things are wrong with this movie. as i said this movie leaps over logic at every turn and with the exception of kim basinger, the acting is made-for-tv bad. hell, this pseudo thriller is made-for-tv bad. the way she kills each of these politically correct thugs(1 caucasian, 1 hispanic, 1 asian and 1 african american all coming together to stalk a caucasian woman. don't you just love america?)is laughable to a fault. the way she killed the hispanic guy made me laugh hysterically. the sex scene with the main hoodlum was so out in left field that it make you shake your head in shame. i only recommend this to lovers of bad films and no one else. anybody else especially kim basinger fans would do well not to own this flick. you don't want see an actress you respect in a film this bad now do you? of course not. you were warned.",0

"i think i usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be ""quirky,"" and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters' simplicity in the face of a complicated context. what was exceptional about big bad swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laugh-out-loud humor in scene after scene. there was a sophistication, maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the dp, i've rarely seen in an indie film, and even more rarely in a comedy. of special note here: paget brewster's turn as amy the math teacher. after seeing this performance i cannot understand why brewster hasn't been ""discovered"" by a larger audience. she brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential. this is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience. i look forward to more from the director and this cast!",1
"here is one of those movies spoiled by the studio's insistence on a happy ending. conflicts which have stretched out for years are settled in a few minutes. it would have been far more interesting to inject a tone of ambiguity. the talented barbara stanwyck is undone by a sudden metamorphosis from independent and assertive woman to a compliant female of the kind she has put down all her life. brent, as usual, is well over his head and then there is the ludicrous situation of gig young playing a character named gig young. someone mentions ""gig young"" and then who appears but gig young, the actor! worth seeing though far below what it could have been.",0
"this is a musical adaptation of dicken's ""oliver twist"". for the most part, the original story has been maintained, though for the flow of the film certain subplots (such as the summer he spent recuperating and the half-brother) are omitted. the biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book, fagin is hanged--an ending very different from this musical film.  this is a one of a kind musical--one whose style and scope really hasn't been matched before or since. not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable, but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold. whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing, here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more. it's truly a sight to see and i was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories. having just seen it again a few moments ago, i would have to say that the film only got better over time. great sets, wonderful acting and singing--this is a special treat that is hard not to love.  by the way, when i saw the film again tonight, i was surprised by just how high and feminine mark lester's singing was for the film. well, according to imdb, his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice.",1
"the inspiring story of carl brashear (cuba gooding, jr.), a black man who grew up in poverty in kentucky and then joined the us navy, aspiring to be the first black master diver in navy history. we are shown the series of struggles from boyhood on that brashear has to overcome to make his dream come true (and then to keep it alive.) not the least of the challenges was master diver bill sunday (robert deniro), the head trainer at the diving school the navy sends brashear to, who is not especially sympathetic to brashear's goals, but who ultimately becomes an unlikely friend and supporter.  this is a good movie; fast paced and with a lot of action, although not an ""action"" pic in the normal sense of the word. there's a very human story here as well, and an interesting study of racism and the struggle to overcome it; there's also a sense of the struggle that took place in the 1960's between older and younger naval officers (the ""old navy"" vs the ""new navy."") the performances are quite good - particularly goodings'. i thought deniro was perhaps a bit over the top in his portrayal of sunday (although, who knows, sunday might well have been this extreme kind of loose cannon) and the portrayal of sunday's wife gwen (by charlize theron) also made me question whether these parts were ""jazzed up"" to provide entertainment value.  a good movie, though. i never once wondered if it was worth tuning into.  7/10",1
"written on the wind, directed by douglas sirk and released in 1956, is like all of sirk's mid 50's films- pure melodrama. yet it is engrossing, richly developed melodrama, and sirk's trademark lurid colour expressionism, throbbing, barely repressed emotions, symbolism and juxtaposition of the classes make this a film to crave.  the film opens brilliantly, with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling. sirk uses a clever flashback structure to take us into his world...  robert stack and dorothy malone are magnificent as the two hadley ""kids"", kyle and marylee. he drinks and sleeps around with women. she drinks and sleeps around with men. they both are worth millions, thanks to the hadley oil business. hunky, yet poor, mitch wayne (rock hudson) is kyle's lifelong friend, and marylee's dream lover. enter into this sordid mess lucy moore (lauren bacall), a slim, attractive young woman who falls under kyle's charms after he picks up a phone and flies her across the countryside one evening. mitch loves her too, but kyle wins her. they quickly marry, and kyle stops drinking. but fate seems to be written on the wind, and it is not long before a conniving marylee (who will ""have mitch"", marriage or no marriage), a secretly smitten mitch, the confused lucy and the sad drunk kyle come to blows....  malone is just wonderful as marylee hadley, thoroughly deserving her best supporting actress oscar. she steals every scene she is in. stack is almost just as good, amping up the melodrama, while still maintaining subtly and quiet desperation. hudson and bacall are a lot more restrained than those two, yet it is in keeping with the characters they play.  so, what's all this melodrama really about it? well, a lot of things. stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear, for one thing. sirk surrounds stack with phallic symbols throughout the film- note his tiny little gun, the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol, kyle's seeming inability to conceive children. stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex, made worse by his father's preference for hudson, his sister's desire for hudson, and his suspicion that his wife is carrying on with hudson. with all this wealth kyle hadley still ends up at the wrong end of town, buying cheap corn liquor like a ""bum"".  it's about impossible dreams, and having to let go of them. the river where kyle, marylee and mitch used to play when they were kids is constantly referenced throughout the film, symbolising kyle and (especially) marylee's wish for the innocence and simplicity of youth. in an excellent melodramatic scene, perfectly pulled off by malone, marylee's stands by the river and imagines herself again as a child, with voice-over of mitch telling marylee that she will always be his girl. this is where sirk strikes a huge emotional chord with the viewer. who hasn't dreamed about going back to that special place in childhood? who hasn't, at some point, lived on a treasured memory? who hasn't wanted something they couldn't have? and hudson's last line of the film (yes, he gets no dialogue in the last 10 or so minutes, only close-ups) recollects on how ""far we've come from the river, marylee"". amazing.",1
"i like this episode quite a bit, ruth gordon is good if not a little hammy as she always was. as has been stated, the music is very good, and it has a moodiness that doesn't exist in all episodes.  but one major plot hole exists, so wide you can drive a fleet of trucks through it. it is established that the light doesn't work in the vault. don't you think that the very intelligent columbo or the rest of the police would have thought to check if the light bulb worked? you'd think in pretty short order they would have unscrewed the bulb and so found the note. granted this is tv whodunit fiction, and various holes will always be found, but this seems much too glaring.  it really doesn't make columbo out to be the hidden genius when the light doesn't work but the ""death bed"" testimony goes on unfound, apparently for days.",1
"in the same vein as natural born killers, another movie that was not so popular with critics because of its excessive violence but that i also loved, kalifornia is a movie that clearly glamorizes violence, but i like to think that it turns that around in the final act. kind of like how the basketball diaries glamorizes drugs at first, but shows the bad side by the end of the movie, which is far worse than the good side is good. david duchovny plays brian kessler, an artistic yuppie with an even more artistically yuppie girlfriend, who is into that violent sexy black and white photography generally reserved for, i don't know where, places where nudity passes for art. maybe it really does and i just don't understand it. at any rate, brian and carrie (duchovny and michelle forbes, who fits the role flawlessly), make the perfect couple to go on a documentary tour of famous murder sites. brian, the writer, will write the book, carrie can take the pictures.  being artistic types, brian and carrie are not quite financially prepared for such a trip, so they put out an ad for someone to share gas and travel expenses, and are contacted by early grace and adele corners (brad pitt and juliette lewis). early is on parole and assigned to janitorial work at the local university by his parole officer, sees the ad on a bulletin board, and decides to leave the state for a while, violating his parole but also leaving the scene of his landlord's murder so he won't have to deal with a pesky murder investigation. two birds with one stone, you know.  the movie has a curious ability to portray two stereotypes, the artsy yuppies and the greasy trailer trash, without resorting to clichés or even ending up with caricatures of either type. brian and carrie are artsy liberals, but while carrie catches on to early and adele, brian is fascinated with early's status as an outlaw, as seen in the scene where brian shoots early's gun. never having fired a gun before, he's as fascinated as a little kid. while adele and carrie are back at a hotel and adele reveals such things in her childlike way as the fact that early ""broke her"" of smoking and that she's not allowed to drink (early doesn't think women should), early and brian are out at the local bar. brian reacts nervously to a drunk trying to start a fight with him, and early first gives advice to brian on what to do and then steps in and dishes out a quick lesson for the guy. ""hit him, bri, it's comin'."" this is one of my favorite scenes in the movie, partly because it's so funny what early gleefully says as the guy's friends drag him away, bloodied and battered, but also because as it is intercut with the girls back at the hotel, we learn so much all at once about the two couples, their differences, and the conflicts that are likely to come up because of them. and besides that, because brian benefited from early's actions and carrie is appalled by what she hears from adele, it also illustrates the different way that carrie and brian react to early and adele.  clearly, by now, you can tell that this is not your typical odd couple type of thriller, where the city folk run into the country folk and all sorts of stereotypical mayhem ensues. on one hand it seems a little too convenient that brian and carrie go on a tour of murder sites and just happen to be accompanied by a real life murderer, but on the other hand it's a great way to counteract the glorifying of murder that is inherent within a cross-country trip designed to bring fame to murderers and their crimes. while studying the actions of past murderers, brian and carrie ultimately find themselves face to face with the very material that they are studying, and realize that murder is not as pretty or morbidly fascinating when it's in your face as it is through disconnected studies of murders past.  i am constantly amazed at brad pitt's versatility as an actor. consider, for example, his roles in movies like kalifornia, 12 monkeys, fight club, and ocean's 11 and 12. pitt is like tom hanks in that he can change his appearance drastically or just enough to fit a given character, and is completely believable. incidentally, i tried in vain to be early grace for halloween this year, but just couldn't get the hair and beard right. i even got the hat right, which initially i thought would be the hardest part.  it's easy to understand why a lot of people disliked kalifornia or why they think that it glorifies violence and murder, but i think that whatever glorifying it does is done with the intention of clarifying the audience's understanding of its subject matter. a film that didn't glorify violence, at least initially, could never be as effective as kalifornia, but the movie structures it perfectly. the glorification is all embodied in brian's and carrie's fascination with the idea of murder and the auras of the places in which is happened, but their realization, and ours, is embodied in the real thing, which they encounter with early and adele. the movie's very purpose is to describe that difference between idealizing violence and seeing the horror of it up close and for real.",1
"of all the football films i have watched, this is one of the 2 best. the other being fever pitch. but hero is about the greatest world cup ever and consequently arguably also the greatest player ever to play in a world cup, diego maradona. this story is centered around him principally but also revolves around the other giants of the game at the time.  the musical score is evocative and the images are powerful. the narration by michael caine is suitably unbiased and also calmly dramatic. this story is not about the individual games of the world cup; rather it is more about the emotions of the players and the beauty of the event itself.  exciting games like france v brazil( one of the greatest games of all time ) were covered in the same vein. the final argentin v w germany was also in the same vein. highly recommended. a classic of world football. to be watched over and over again, esp if you're a maradona fan.",1
"it is rare that one comes across a movie as flawless as this. it's truly one of the best acted, most tightly structured films i've ever seen. every line of dialogue can be interpreted in several ways, relating to each of the three main characters differently. the film weaves an intrinsic web of motivations and double crosses that snare you and refuse to let go. add to this that the slow-burning romance between kevin and faye is as moving as anything that's ever been committed to celluloid and you have the ingredients for a perfect film. it exposes the romance of movies such as ""titanic"" as the trite cliches they are. if you're looking for a movie to watch while you fold laundry, this isn't it. you have to commit yourself to this film. you can't have a conversation while running in and out of the room. this movie demands your attention. treat it with the respect you deserve and you'll get a lot out of it. unless you think ""titanic"" is the greatest film ever.",1
"i am fully aware there is no statistical data that readily supports the correlation between video games and real life violence. the movie is false and phony because it is in complete contradiction of itself, which is what i tried to emphasize in my original review. the movie fails, not necessarily because i really do think these kids were influenced by video games, but because the movie sets it up as ""random"" and doesn't follow through. let me clarify. in aileen: life and death of a serial killer, you can see her claims about the police and being controlled by radio waves are ridiculous, yet she is so troubled, she really believes them to be true. the viewer can make the distinction however. in zero day, the 2 kids keep saying how they are not influenced by anything environmental, which is obviously false since everything they do contradicts this. neo-nazism, talking about going on cnn with wolf blitzer (which is laughable not only because they know his name, but its a shameless attempt by the filmmaker to get coverage of his bad movie)..etc. this movie doesn't depict 'reality', it shows nothing but phoniness to prove a point. unfortunately you fell for the bait and didn't see this, and you didn't pick up on it from my review either. the entire movie is just taking michael moore's hypothesis and applying it to something ""real life"" in hopes of validating and it fails, not necessarily because the hypothesis is wrong, but because the movie is wrong and doesn't support it. of course i don't think kids that play video games are more likely to kill people, but if i'm not mistaken, didn't video tape exist of the columbine kids (or some teen killers) shooting guns in the forest claiming how much they looked or acted like the weaponry in doom? hmmmmmmm, the distinction is kids are most likely aware of the media, influenced, but obviously balanced or intelligent enough that its not even an issue. zero day is a bad movie not because i really believe a correlation exists, but because the film maker doesn't know what hes trying to say, and the movie does more to disprove his point then support it. it's almost as if the new ratings given to video games made someone upset so they came up with 'zero day' in retaliation. if you want to see the 'mindless' teen killer theory pulled off right, go watch bully.",0
"believe it or not, inspector gadget's last case is what got me hooked on the whole gadget thing.  my name is miriam and i am twelve years old, so obviously i wasn't around when inspector gadget was at the top of his career. sure, i'd heard of him, but i didn't really know him.  while reading, note that i never saw the original series (i would if it came on!). this is just about the only gadget thing i've ever watched (even though i am now obsessed) and i will be focusing on what i liked about it since everyone else is so negative. for all you pessimists, i've got some cons down there, too. =p first off, for a childish sense of humor, you could deem this movie pretty funny. i thought it was, so sue me. i also thought the animation and character designs were good, and i'm also happy there was more gadget in it, since he's my favorite character. (i do not like penny.) then there was claw (his voice was awful, though) and the madcat; i thought they were done fairly good too. gadget's idiocy seemed pretty well in place, if not a bit exaggerated (i.e. sucking his hat-hand thing's thumb. would make a good screen shot, though. =p) oh, and i liked the song that ran in the credits. yes, i am strange.  and, like all movies, there are some negatives, too.  talking cars? what's up with that? you can tell this was aimed at younger boys. that wouldn't bother me quite so much if there wasn't the fact that the cars basically saved the day. i would have much preferred if penny and brain had taken their place. and, apparently, gadget loved his car more than would be called natural. a bit weird, to say the least.  oh, and the chief was downright mean to gadget. i mean, sheesh, yeah, he wasn't always the most cheerful of people, but he didn't hate gadget, from what i've read. like the inspector, his personality was exaggerated.  well, that's pretty much all i have to say about this movie. i thought the animation made up for the car-centered plot and that it was overall pretty decent; more so than the live-action gadget films (butchered, butchered, butchered!) at least. maybe i'm just biased because this is what got me into gadget in the first place, or maybe my mind is twisted, or maybe i'm just odd, but i really liked this movie, even if i'm the oldest it's recommended for.",1

"""the screaming skull"" opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it - now there's a hook! the story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick: scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness, then attempts to convince her that she's going insane with shrill noises, mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times. add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the man's first wife who he was devoted to. maybe it's just that the 1950's didn't have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie, the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane. but then again, when i first saw ""house on haunted hill"" as a nine year old, it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way i'm sure this film did for young viewers of the same era.  don't get me wrong, the film is not terrible, it just seems to get tedious at times. but there's some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished whitlock home, and the gardens and pool are a nice touch. for me the best played out scene involves eric whitlock (john hudson) going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull, he just wades right in clothes and all, in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener (director alex nicol in a dual role). it makes you wonder who the real dimwit was.  in it's own good way, perhaps the most shocking thing about the film: how about that neat roadster the whitlock's make their first appearance in - gull wing doors in 1958! that at least made me jump out of my seat!",0

"director alfred green's melodrama ""baby face"" with barbara stanwyck ranks as one of the more notorious of the pre-code movies. these films were produced before the production code administration had the power to enforce its rules in 1934. ""inspiration"" scenarist gene markey and ""midnight mary"" scribe kathryn scola penned the screenplay, based on mark canfield's story, about the rise and fall of a girl who used her sexual charms to acquire wealth and position in society. incidentally, mark canfield was a pseudonym for producer daryl f. zanuck. these pre-code films today seem tame, but they aroused controversy galore and contained more racy material than most movies until the late 1950s when the code began to erode. the themes that the filmmakers explore are women versus men, women versus women, and women versus society. our crafty protagonist does enough skulduggery that all themes are about equal.  lily's worthless father nick powers (robert barret of ""distant drums"") operates an illegal speakeasy bar during prohibition, when the thirteen amendment outlawed liquor, and brews his own booze in a still out back. nick is such as an obnoxious fellow that he pimps out her beautiful, but hard-working daughter lily (barbara stanwyck of ""night nurse""), but lily refuses to help her father out with a sleazy local politician. the politician. ed sipple (arthur hohl of ""private detective 62"") vows to retaliate for lily's refusal to accommodate him. later, nick chews his rebellious daughter out. lily reproaches him. ""yeah, i'm a tramp and who's to blame? my father, a swell start you gave me, nothing but men, dirty, rotten men. and you're lower than any of them."" no sooner has she stormed off than nick dies when his still blows up and kills him. lily and her african-american maid chico (theresa harris of ""arrowsmith"") pack their bags and catch a ride of the first freight leaving town.  no sooner have our heroines arrived in new york than lily uses her charm to get a job in a bank. visually, director green shows lily's shrewd ascension up the ladder with camera angles that move upward until lily's sexuality threatens to destroy the bank. at one point, lily breaks up a marriage between one bank officer, ned stevens (donald cook of ""the public enemy"") and his fiancée, anne carter (margaret lindsay of ""cavalcade"") after stevens had almost fired her for flirting with her boss, brody (douglas dumbrille of ""his women"") in the employee restroom. lily is extremely shrewd and manages to emerge from each debacle better off than before. the board of trustees hires courtland trenholm (george bent of ""jezebel"") to take over as president of the bank. the first thing that trenholm does is pay off lily instead of letting her publish her diary entries about the higher ups at the bank. moreover, trenholm ships lily off to their branch bank in paris where lily doesn't create any commotion until trenholm arrives and they become romantically attached. lily fights tooth and nail for everything that she has gotten and hates to throw it all away, but she sacrifices everything at the end for her husband.  ironically, lily winds up back in the same town that she started out in, but trenholm and she are happy now. ""baby face"" qualifies as one of the five best pre-code movies. look for john wayne dressed up in a suit and tie in one scene.",1

"the teasers for tree of palme try to pass it off as a sort of allegory for a fairy tale with actual meaning, then immediately start raving about the animation. i should have known what that meant.  the main character, palme, is a good example of the whole movie's problem. one minute, palme is a humble hero in search of himself, the next a violent psycho with an unhealthy fixation on a girl he once took care of.  like all of the characters in the movie, palme is poorly defined. you do not bond with the characters at all, although shatta has acquired a couple of fan girls. it seems that the writer was more interested in cramming all the drama and complexity he could into this movie than actually exploring his characters' motivations and personalities.  new, useless story lines were being introduced in the last fifteen minutes of the movie. the writer seriously needed to streamline his story. perhaps he was trying to be epic, but it was simply too much information for a two-hour movie. however i can't help but wonder if a plot with so many dimensions and characters would have been better suited for a tv series or graphic novel.  in the last five minutes of the movie, i simply could not endure the sheer lack of quality any longer and began laughing at how contrived the characters, the relationships, and the whole plot was. i touched my companion and he started cracking up too, as did a young man seated behind us. we tried so hard to control ourselves, but we simply could not take the terrible quality of this movie.  on the bright side, the animation is incredible and viewers will find themselves admiring the lush backgrounds and charming character designs. the animation almost guides you; when you don't care about the characters, it tells you how to feel.",0

"after seeing jeremy brett as sherlock holmes, no actor should ever display such conceit as to imagine that he could ever come close to mr. brett's portrayal of ""one of the most interesting characters in literature"". jeremy brett is sherlock holmes and in my opinion there can be no other. the great actor basil rathbone is,i must admit, a close second but, is still second. one might make the argument that mr. rathbone's screenplays were inferior to the absolutely top notch productions afforded mr. brett and to this i would agree. however when all is said and done jeremy brett will always and forever be the only actor to truly ""become"" sherlock holmes. the book should be closed on this subject and we,the public,left to enjoy mr.brett's unique performances.  bill rogers   (sonarman65@yahoo.com)",1
"whenever i make up a list of the absolute worst movies i've ever seen, this movie is always on it. it has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. it took an act of will to sit through the whole thing, and i would sooner spill my own blood than have to sit through it again.  what's wrong with it? let me tell you the story of my trip to go see it in the theater.  i went to a midnight show, on a saturday night. i the only ones in the theater were myself, and a bunch of loud, boisterous, rather unruly teenagers, sitting somewhere behind me. they were obviously out having a good time on a saturday night, and had come to this ""comedy"" for some laughs. before the movie starts, during the previews, they were laughing and joking and making loud comments having a grand old time. it was borderline annoying; had they continued their unbridled enthusiasm into the actual movie, i might've said something, but i was feeling tolerant and empathetic of their spirited fun, so i let it go. and they did settle down once the movie started.  why am i telling you all this? because you can judge this alleged ""comedy"" by the effect it had not just on myself, but on this rowdy bunch.  during the entire run of the film, not one person in the theater laughed. not once. not myself, not the boisterous kids. absolute silence, aside from the soundtrack. and when the film was over and the lights came on, we all, all of us, slowly filed out of the theater in slow, somber, absolute silence. it could've been a funeral.  this was the effect that this ""comedy"" produced. not laughter, not enjoyment, but absolute depression. it was a depressing, depressing movie, and not the tiniest bit funny. preachy, self-indulgent, depressing, but not funny.  i consider mel brooks' ""blazing saddles"" to be on the short list for funniest movie ever. it still absolutely blows my mind that the same gentleman could be responsible for quite probably the least funny movie ever.  in short: if you're feeling too happy, give this movie a whirl; otherwise, don't say i didn't warn you.",0
"well the main reason i tuned in to watch this film is because it was done by trey parker and matt stone of south park fame. however as soon as the film started the laughs started erupting from my belly. from the subtle gestures towards a joke, to the blatant toilet humour throughout, along with a constant reliance on some very witty innuendo. this film could ruin event he sternest mans poker face, let alone his poker underwear. some of the funniest blink and you'll miss it jokes ever portrayed in hollywood, along with constant critique of themselves thrown into the bargain.  i just goes to show that not only is trey parker adept at writing he's not too shabby at the old acting game either. i was surprised with the amount that i was absorbed in this film. however i'm quite worried that it is not available to buy over the internet, here in the uk. sort it out boys!  i am, and will continue to show it to all my friends annoyingly pointing out the funny bits, and occasionally snorting into my lager. all in all an excellent film if you are a fan of unnecessary comedy. however if you have no sense of humour about silly or rude things steer well clear! however i'm sure the inclusion of jenny mccarthy and jasmine bleeth could have you gurgling past those prejudices.",1
"without reiterating what was said above about this movie, i would like to add that i was looking forward to watching this film...the cast/location and the work of the excellent director michael winterbottom etc...it had a vague shadow of 'don't look now' about the storyline from the beginning. a stay in different surroundings (italy again) to dim the heartbreak of loss...or perhaps that's how i saw it? so consequently i sat there waiting for the story to unfold and put a spin on what we expect to happen to this family in a foreign european country....and i sat there and sat there....and guess what? nothing actually happens! and i mean nothing!! you are not even given the chance to get into the characters as they are so 1 dimensional and vacuous..you are led to believe from the pace of the movie that something was going to happen to turn the whole film on it's head...the eldest daughters flirtation with the local vespa boys, had great scope to take the movie in another direction, the youngest daughters visions of her dead mother ended up being a fruitless and pointless exercise, the fathers attempts at being seduced by one of his female students felt ridiculous given his age. it felt as if the script had a last recall made where they decided at the last minute to eradicated any guts to the story and went for paring it down to a bare minimum to no effect. when the credits started to roll (unexpectedly) you can't help but feel robbed of your time spent sat watching this pile of rubbish.",0
"i read that jessie matthews was approached and turned down co-starring with fred astaire in damsel in distress. jessie matthews in her prime never left her side of the pond to do any american musical films. if they had teamed for this film it would have been a once in a lifetime event.  it's a pity because damsel in distress has everything else going for it. fred astaire, story and adapted to screen by author p.g. wodehouse, burns&allen for comedy, and songs by the gershwin brothers. in answer to the question posed by the nice work if you can get it, there isn't much you could ask more for this film.  except a leading lady. though ginger rogers made several films away from fred astaire, damsel in distress is the only film astaire made without rogers while they were a team. young joan fontaine was cast in this opposite astaire.  her character has none of the bite that ginger rogers's parts do in these films. all she basically has to do is act sweet and demure. she also doesn't contribute anything musically. and if i had to rate all the dancing partners of fred astaire, joan fontaine would come out at the bottom. the poor woman is just horrible in the things are looking up number.   when she co-starred later on in a musical with bing crosby, the emperor waltz, it's no accident that fontaine is given nothing musical to do.  the version i have is a colorized one and in this case i think it actually did some good. the idyllic lush green english countryside of p.g. wodehouse is really brought out in this vhs copy. especially in that number i mentioned before with astaire and fontaine which does take place in the garden.  burns&allen on the other hand as a couple of old vaudeville troopers complement astaire in grand style in the stiff upper lip number. the surreal fun-house sequence is marvelously staged.  p.g. wodehouse's aristocracy runs the gamut with constance collier at her haughty best and for once montagu love as fontaine's father as a nice man on film.  the biggest hit out of a damsel in distress is a foggy day maybe the best known song about the british capital city since london bridge is falling down. done in the best simple elegant manner by fred astaire, it's one of those songs that will endure as long as london endures and even after.  overlooking the young and inexperienced joan fontaine, a damsel in distress rates as a classic, classic score, classic dancing, classic comedy. who could ask for anything more?",1
"i was disappointed. the film was a bit predictable and did not live up to the hype plastered all over the box. having said that, the characters were well developed, the windego myth was used in a unique premise and the house was pretty spooky but it just missed for me. i kept waiting for that big ahhhhh or boo! but it never came.  furthermore the movie was plagued with poor filming of poor special effects. thus showing to much of a bad thing and not using atmosphere and viewer imagination to create the horror and suspense. try movies like session 9 or the cube if your looking for a low-budget but well conceived horror movie.",0
"carlito way, the original is a brilliant story about an ex-drug dealer who hopes to leave his criminal past and so he invests in a club and the deals with the trouble that comes with it.  this film was....  i saw the trailer and knew instantly it was going to be bad..but after dismissing films in the past and finding out they were great( lucky number slevin, tokyo drift)...i gave this a shot and it failed within the first five minutes...  the script is something a teenager would come up with if given five minutes to prepare...it was weak, with weaker dialogue. it seems there is an instant need for romance in a gangster movie. so brigante decides to beat a guy up for the girl....and she say's 'yes!' and if you need to act bad just throw racism around...as we learn from the 'italian mobsters'...  the acting was terrible to say the least...i found 'hollywood nicky', hilarious.  i absolutely hate all these musicians turning to movies. lets face it the only reason p diddy did this movie was so he could play a gangsters...the actress who plays leticia was weak but beautiful. the sex scene was weak but we got to see her..which was okay...  but overall i expected it shed light on how carito ended up in prison and the love of his life...and the assassin towards the end completely added to the horrendous movie that is...  carlito's way: rise to power..",0
"it gets really bad. the only half-way redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film. there are context errors everywhere. the acting is horrible, save kirk. the story is as holey as the grail, and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie, if it wasn't already a corpse. so all in all it's a waste of your life. i would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale.",0
"tess of the storm country is possibly the best movie of all of mary pickford's films. at two hours, it was quite long for a 1922 silent film yet continues to hold your interest some 80 years after it was filmed. mary gives one of her finest performances at times the role seems like a ""greatest hits"" performance with bits of mary the innocent, mary the little devil, mary the little mother, mary the spitfire, mary the romantic heroine, etc. characteristics that often were used throughout a single film in the past. the movie is surprisingly frank about one supporting character's illegitimate child for 1922 and at one point our little mary is thought the unwed mother in question! if the academy awards had been around in 1922, no doubt the best actress oscar for the year would have been mary's.",1
"having watched both the lion king and lion king ii and enjoyed both thoroughly. i thought lion king 1.5 might be worth watching. what a disappointment ! disney must be getting desperate for revenues.  especially now that they lost the deal with pixar.  basically, they just picked up some bits of footage that were left on the editor's floor (or garbage can) and glued them together to make a  quick buck. unlike lk i & ii, both of which had strong story lines.  this movie hardly has a story at all. while the characters and animation are always fun to look at, there is simply not enough material here for a movie. some of the bits could have been good 2nd disk fillers on the original offerings.  disney - shame on you for putting this trash out to make a quick buck!  next time take the time and effort and put our an enduring work.",0
"7 if you're a kid- 6 if you claim to be an adult. this semi-sequel to the lion king sees to spin off side characters timone and pumba, retelling the original story through their eyes, including the story of how they met. in the grand tradition of disney, inferior sequels are made, and occasionally tv series featuring the adventures of minor characters from their biggest hits. you can be as sceptical as you want about this, but kids and fans of the series will likely not care; their are enough jokes and songs and interesting things to ensure that this is one of the few above average sequels. this works because of the charm of the much-loved central characters, the quick pace, the in-jokes involving the first film, and for older viewers there are some funny gags. the animation is as good as ever, if a little less flamboyant than the original, but the plot here is all about taking it easy, hakuna matata.  timone and pumba decide to watch the events of the first film, frequently stopping mid-film to joke about parts of it, like a real audience. we see how timone is a near outcast, he feels he does not fit in and decides to go looking beyond what he sees to find his ideal home. on the way he meets pumba, another outcast and they become friends. soon they meet simba, a lion cub, natural predator of t and p, but they form a trio. however, when simba realises he must follow his own destiny and leave the group, it is up to the others to decide whether to help or not, and how. of course the usual disney elements and themes are here, friendship, good versus evil etc. the plot is simple but works on many levels, making it smarter than your average animated movie. as the cg movies appear, disney's traditional form must become smarter, but not forget the roots which made them popular. toy story and all that have come since have been clever, with jokes to suit all ages, and it seems this is the way the market is shifting. however, there will always be a place for films like this, and you cannot go wrong buying this for the youngsters.  7 out of 10",1

"a drama at its very core, ""anna"" displays that genuine truth that all actors age, and sometimes, fade away. anna is a character that believes america is her safety net, her home, and it can do her no wrong  but she refuses to belittle herself to do work she doesn't believe in. she is hard-nosed, optimistic, stubborn, and arrogant when it comes to her life, yet not afraid to let others in, yet drop them at a moments notice. anna flip-flops between personalities, which makes this film ideal of an aging star, but not idea of the viewing audience. ""anna"" has been praised for its star sally kirkland, and her ability to get ""grungy"" for the role, but a month into 2008, ""anna"" does not remain a staple of film culture. it is dated, dull, and formulaically chaotic.  director yurek bogayevicz has a message hidden within ""anna"" about the falsehoods of czechoslovakia, both politically and socially, but kirkland refuses to let them upstage her. bogayevicz is not afraid to play with the camera, to use wooden frames to allow kirkland to stand out, and he is not afraid to lessen the surrounding characters so that when you walk away from the film, it is kirkland you remember. if it isn't obvious, this film didn't sit well with me. from the opening of the first act and deep within the second, ""anna"" felt like a high school theater production. the characters were non-existent, there was no enlightening pre-story, and there was no definition of time or place. there was sally kirkland, stubbornly saying that she is better than the other actresses vying for the same lifestyle that she wants. randomly she encounters a friend, a young girl that has also traveled a long distance to get to america for the glitz and glamour, and two of them (within the span of 20 minutes) build a friendship that could break all walls. it is emotionally boring and unbelievable. again, randomly, we meet anna's boyfriend daniel (played by the weak robert fields), who brings nothing to the table in terms of definition or character  only to boost the attention onto kirkland's anna. through the course of nearly two hours, we watch as more random acts coupled with unnamed characters intertwine together to feebly create a story that is held together by loose threads  and sally kirkland. arg, it pains me to continue to say this but ""anna"" could have been a fantastic film had bogayevicz presented equal time between anna, daniel, and krystina, but instead we are forced into a one-sided game where emotional scenes speak louder than plot.  is this where charlize theron found inspiration for her beauty-less role in ""monster"", or halle berry in ""monster's ball""? was sally kirkland one of the early actresses discover that by letting themselves go for a character oscar will shine in their direction? throughout this film i was disgusted by kirkland's portrayal of anna, and bogayevicz's lack of excitement for anything else fluent. bogayevicz gives us an anna that doesn't work hard for her parts, doesn't care for others, and is generally mean spirited  yet we are to feel sympathy for her? near the beginning of the film, she forces what she wants to do onto others, and gets upset when she doesn't get her way. sure, aging actresses my have that appeal to them, but kirkland creates a more childish character instead of a mature one. that is where ""anna"" could have improved. if this was a mature kirkland, i would have gobbled it up, but this stammering childish anna was impossible to believe. while my favorite scene was near the end where anna goes to watch one of her older films playing (included is absurd make-out characters) and the film burns, this scene is also one of my least favorite. anna has made a phenomenal life for herself, creating films and building the dream, yet when anyone else wants to enter that spotlight, she gets jealous and outraged. this didn't make for a character i wanted to stand behind nor win oscars. coupled with the classic 80s background synthesizer, the outrageous over-the top wardrobe, and the displaced ending (where did that come from and what happened??)  ""anna"" slipped far in the scope of amazing cinema. it was a show-piece, an opportunity for an aging star to yell at the world one more time. in this one it worked, but i don't think i will be fooled again.  overall, i cannot say that i was impressed with this film. ""anna"" is not a film about an aging film star; it is about sally kirkland, and only sally kirkland. bogayevicz tries to do more with the story, but fails either because kirkland will not allow him or he just realizes that there isn't enough to support a full story. there are one or two decent scenes in this film, but nothing that promotes this film as innovative or influential. bogayevicz did not create a character that audiences would believe, tear up for, or dedicate a sunday afternoon with  he created an annoyance. kirkland wasn't anna, she was an actress playing her a bit overdone and crusty on the sides. perhaps i missed the scope of this film, but what makes films like this work is the cooperation of everyone involved. that wasn't the case here. in ""anna"", kirkland orders daniel to act like a dog (apparently as a symbolic act) and yet during the entire emotional scene, i couldn't help but think that was what kirkland was like to those on the set. she didn't make this into a film, she transformed it into her own production, and because of it ""anna"" failed. i cannot suggest this to anyone  from one czech to another  skip it!   grade: * ½ out of ***** (for that pesky theater scene that creeped me out)",0
"1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in hollywood history, with more classic films released than in any other, and john ford directed three of the best, ""stagecoach"", ""drums along the mohawk"", and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the union, ""young mr. lincoln"".  with the world plunging into a war that america dreaded, but knew it would be drawn into, abraham lincoln was much on people's minds, in 1939, as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life, and had triumphed. on broadway, robert e. sherwood's award-winning ""abe lincoln in illinois"", with raymond massey's physically dead-on portrayal, was playing to packed houses (it would be filmed in 1940). carl sandburg's continuation of his epic biography, ""abraham lincoln: the war years"", was published, and quickly became a best seller. president roosevelt frequently referred to lincoln in speeches, and the lincoln memorial, in washington, d.c., became the most popular landmark in town (a fact that frank capra made good use of, in ""mr. smith goes to washington"").  all this was not lost on darryl f. zanuck, at 20th century fox; as soon as he read lamar trotti's screenplay of lincoln's early days as a lawyer, he designated it a 'prestige' production, and assigned john ford to direct, and henry fonda, to star.  fonda did not want to play lincoln; he felt he couldn't do justice to the 'great emancipator', and feared a bad performance would damage his career. even a filmed make-up test, in which he was stunned by how much he would resemble lincoln, wouldn't change his mind. according to fonda, john ford, whom he'd never worked with, cussed him out royally, at their first meeting, and explained he wasn't portraying the lincoln of legend, but a young ""jackanape"" country lawyer facing his first murder trial. humbled, fonda took the role. (john ford offered a different scenario of the events, but the outcome was the same!) obviously, they found a chemistry together that worked, as nearly all of their pairings would produce 'classics'.  unlike the introverted, melancholia-racked lincoln of ""abe lincoln in illinois"", ford's vision was that of a shy but likable young attorney, who made friends easily, and misses the mother he lost, too young (resulting in a bond with a pioneer mother that becomes a vital part of the story). injustice riles him, and he speaks 'common sense' to quell violence, interlaced with doses of humor. both productions play on lincoln's (undocumented) relationship with ann rutledge; in ford's version, the pair are truly in love, and committed to each other. after her death, lincoln would frequently visit her grave, to share his life with her 'spirit' (a theme ford would continue in ""she wore a yellow ribbon"").  a murder trial is the centerpiece of the film, and shows the prodigious talents of the star and director. fonda deftly portrays lincoln's inexperience, yet earnest belief in justice tempered with mercy, and ford emphasizes the gulf between the big-city 'intellectuals' (represented by pompous d.a. donald meek, and his slick 'advisor', stephen douglas, played by a young milburn stone), and the informal, rule-bending country sense of lincoln. with ford 'regular' ward bond as a key witness, the trial is both unconventional, and riveting.  with the film closing as lincoln strides away into the stormy distance, and his destiny (dissolving into a view of the statue at the lincoln memorial), audiences could take comfort in the film's message that if a cause is just, good would ultimately triumph.  ""young mr. lincoln"" is a truly remarkable film, from an amazing year!",1
"much of ""over her dead body"" is so painfully unfunny that i was actually squirming in my seat out of embarrassment for the actors.  eva longoria proves that she can't carry a film in this terrible romantic comedy, and further, that she doesn't really even have any comedic timing. she's grating and annoying as a ghost who returns to earth to keep a cooky psychic from dating her widower fiancé. the fiancé is played by paul rudd, drippy and charmless, while the psychic is played by lake bell, bringing the movie whatever anemic energy it has. i felt most sorry for bell, as she appears to have some comic abilities and was working overtime in an effort to make the material work. unfortunately, she is up against the insurmountable task of making any movie that features jason biggs tolerable, and she is dragged down with the rest of the cast like leo dicaprio at the end of ""titanic.""   ""over her dead body"" actually pi**ed me off, because of its laziness and utter lack of effort. i started to think of all the interesting projects that can't get funded because vast amounts of money are being funneled into bland crap like this. seriously, does hollywood think movies like this are good enough? how stupid do they really think the movie-going public is?   grade: f",0
"when you read the summary of this film, you might come to think that this is something of an odd film and in some ways it is, for the primary character of this film, gerard reve (jeroen krabbé) is haunted by visions and hallucinations. the visions gerard see are all (more or less) subtle hints to what will happen to him as the story continues and it is great fun for the viewer to try and figure out the symbolism used in the film. despite the use of symbolism and a couple of hints to the ending of the film, the film maintains a very high level of excitement throughout and does not get boring for one minute. this is mostly due to the great performances of jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk (christine) and the great direction of the whole by paul verhoeven. his directing style is clearly visible and one can say, looking at it from different angles, that 'de vierde man' is a typical verhoeven film. it will not only seem typical for people familiar with his american films because of the nudity and the graphic violent scenes, but it will also seem typical for people familiar with his dutch films, because of the same things and his talent to tell a great story. when people watch verhoevens american films, short sighted people might say, he has no talent in telling a good story and only focuses on blood and sex. that is what some people think, whereas i think that he is a very talented director who tries to convey a deeper message in each with each film. although not a good film, hollow man (his last american film) is an example that verhoeven can do more than science fiction splatter movies and maybe companies should trust him more and offer him more various films to helm. he needs that. just watch his dutch films. not only do they show that he needs a certain amount of freedom, but they also show that he has remarkable talent. 'de vierde man' brought him one step closer to hollywood and is certainly one of his best.  8 out of 10",1
"i never wanted to see this film, then one day, for a joke i watched it to see how bad it was; my preconceptions were confirmed.  for starters i'd like to question the politics of the film. it hides behind of mask of women 'making it big in the city' but the only way that women can make it big is through using their sexuality rather than their intelligence or skills. these women are nothing more the whores. are slightly less attractive girls not allowed to be successful? this is not the only right wing message of the film, there are hundreds of shots of american flags and huge wads of cash. a fine example of how the only powerful thing in america is capitalism and anything of spiritual, moral or artistic value is not even given a look in of this film. money is depicted as the only important thing to young people.  the manageress of the bar states that she does not allow drug users in her bar, and then she goes on to poor gallons of hard liquor down her own neck and then the necks of her staff and customers. any one who knows anything about intoxicants will know that liquor can be just as dangerous as heroin and more dangerous than most illegal drugs.  and finally, why are scenes in which the lead character is a point of sexual interest to the audience (when she is getting undressed or with her boyfriend) is her father always involved? we watch get her undressed with the camera virtually caressing her legs while she is one the phone to her father. she 'auctions' her father just as she 'auctions' her boyfriend. i find this most strange.  in conclusion, this film is immoral, fascistic, degrading to women and frankly, disturbing. but what else do you expect from jerry bruckhiemer?",0

"the ancient mariner is a truly classic piece of work, as the original poem was/is. the context/setting with the old mariner himself is fine, clear, and without pretense. the artistic work that accompanies the reading of the poem fits perfectly the time/period of the setting and of the work itself, carrying the audience into the period with a still, yet moving accompaniment, using excellent still-movement strategies only well conquered by the pre-mtv era producers and much less apparent in more current works. (mtv brought to television and video a static movement that races through, often irrelevant cuts, from theme to theme without forward movement and without clear relationships to theme or storyline.) the voice, intonation and vitality of redgrave's reading brings this touching poem to life with all its fear, strife and pain. in addition, the smooth movement of the video emphasizes the cadence and occasional monotone (in this case a positive mood under the theme of the story itself)of the author's rendition of the ancient mariner's sad and spooky tale. this is a must for any love of classic poetry, the sea, a tall tale, that almost rings true, and a story that has left a lasting impact on our world and culture. who does not understand the meaning of an ""albatross""? or the concept of ""water, water everywhere and not a drop to drink?"" a truly fine experience. thank you mr. dasilva for bringing this to life for us, never to be forgotten.",1

"a may day 1938 when happen a huge rally celebrating hitler's visit to rome serves as the backdrop for a love story between antoniette(sophia loren)married to fascist(john vernon) and gabriel(marcello mastroianni). she's a boring housewife with several sons and he's a unhappy, solitary homosexual fired from radio and pursued by the fascists. she's left alone in her home when her spouse must to attend the historical celebration. then both develop a very enjoyable relationship in spite of their differences. the film is set on the historic meeting fuher hitler and duce mussolini along with others authorities as count ciano and king victor manuel iii, describing the events by a radio-voice in off which sometimes is irritating.   it's a romantic drama carried out with sense and sensibility. an unrelentingly passionate romance between two conflicting characters. magnificent performances from two pros make a splendid movie well worth seeing. of course ruggero macarri and ettore scola's sensible screenplay results in ever interesting, elaborate and sentimental. colorful and atmospheric cinematography by pascualino de santis. emotive musical score by armando trovajoly with sensitive leitmotif. the film won deservedly golden globes 1978 to best foreign film.  director scola's imagination stretches to light up the limited scenarios where are developing the drama. usually his films take place on a few stages and are semi-theatrical. for example : ¨le bal¨(1982) uses a french dance-hall to illustrate the changes in society 2)¨nuit of varennes(1983) a stagecoach is the scenario where meet an unlikely group as thomas paine, luis xvi and marie antoinette who fled from revolutionary paris 3) ¨the family¨(1987)all take place in the family's grand old roman flat; and of course 4)¨una giornata particulare¨ or ¨a special day¨ where loren and mastroianni strikes up a marvelous relationship into their respective apartments and at the flat roof.",1
"this is one of the worst movies i have ever seen. however, the little slave girl, alice and jared harris imitating christopher walken is what makes this movie entertaining. alice's smoking, drinking and uncanny way of showing up when her name is called is strange and interesting. i have to applaud jared for his christopher walken imitation, and christopher walken for allowing this to be in the movie.",0

"i really wanted to like this, but in the end it's a poorly made film with too few laughs.  the politics are spot on, it's gonna offend the hell out of republicans but that's what it's designed to do. that alone gives me reason to chuckle.  the problem is, it looks like it was made in a real hurry (like about a week). and it contains a stupid subplot about some bimbo singer, which seems to be completely off topic.  turiqistan is obviously iraq, or afghanistan, or any other number of countries the us has f**ked with since the 50s. the humour is a little dark (amputees dancing with prosthetic legs made by tamerlane corporation) but it is on the mark, especially with the corporations cashing in on the reconstruction (""democracy lite""!)   however like a lot of satire criticising the us, it seems terribly heavy handed and laboured. i guess it's running counter to so much bs propaganda so it has to bludgeon people over the head to make a point. who knows. i prefer more of a nudge, wink approach - a bit of subtlety. but that's just me.  anyway i might watch it again, perhaps i missed something.  i'm hoping ""w"" is more on the mark.",0
"bela lugosi plays a doctor who will do anything to keep his wife looking young and beautiful. to this end, he drugs brides during their wedding ceremonies to make it look as if they are dead so he can steal their bodies. i'm not exactly sure what he does with the bodies. i don't remember it ever being fully explained. all i know is that he extracts something from them and injects it in his wife. (i'll just guess that it's spinal fluid. spinal fluid was all the rage of mad scientists in the 40s.) you can pretty much guess the rest from here.  there are a couple (well, really more than a couple, but i'll only write about two) of problems that i have with this movie. one is the way bela is used. sure, he does a decent enough job in his own overacting sort of way (btw, the rest of the cast is simply abysmal). but, to have him hiding in the back of a hearse or having him creep into the female reporter's bedroom to do nothing is just silly. also, why have him beat and/or kill every henchman he has? is it to make him look evil? well, someone who is kidnapping comatose brides doesn't really need to be made to look more evil.  the second problem i have is the idea of drugging brides. why brides? wouldn't any female under the age of 20 do? watching bela go through these gyrations to get his victims, i was reminded of the idiotic fisherman in i still know what you did last summer. in each case, there would appear to be an easier way of reaching your objective than employing a seemingly impossible plan that depends way to much on circumstances out of your control. (btw, an alternate title for this movie is the case of the missing brides. i guess that partially explains the need for 'brides'.)",0
"the young victoria is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by jean-marc vallée of stalwart julian fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become england's longest reigning monarch - victoria. much of the early portion of the film, that part when victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (miranda richardson) and sir john conroy (mark strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. but once victoria (emily blunt) comes of age and is courted by prince albert (rupert friend) the film blooms. blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary lord melbourne (paul bettany). but as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing german prince albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of albert. the film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of queen victoria and prince albert's effect on the various royalties throughout europe! it makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in emily blunt and rupert friend. a solid if not transporting epic.   grady harp",1
"i was not expecting much going in to this, but still came away disappointed. this was my least favorite halestorm production i have seen. i thought it was supposed to be a comedy, but i only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes. is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over? what was up with the janitor in heaven scene? fred willard has been hilarious with some of his christopher guest collaborations, but this did not work. they must have spent all the budget on getting ""known"" actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget. it looked like it was filmed with a video camera and most scenes were very dark. does it really take that much film to show someone actually shoot and make a basket, as opposed to cutting away and editing a ball swishing through a basket? i try not to be too critical of low budget comedies, but if you want to see something funny go to a real church basketball game instead of this movie.",0
"ostensibly a film that predicts the coming trends in british popular music, it's wrong on so many fronts that it's laughable. tommy quickly? the honeycombs? the movie does include a song by the spencer davis group, two by the animals, and one tacked on live film of the beatles doing their live version of twist and shout (all 1:20). but all in all, an awkward display of british music circa 1964. oh, and herman's hermits.",0
"as far as cinematography goes, this film was pretty good for the mid 50's. there were a few times that the lighting was way too hot but the shots were generally in frame and stayed in focus. the acting was above average for a low budget stinker but the direction was horrible. several scenes were dragged out way too long in an attempt at suspense and the effects were non-existent. the attack by the skull in the pond should have been completely removed from the final cut and every attempt to bring life to the skull was obvious with stick pokes and strings. i also couldn't help but think the budget didn't allow them to furnish the house so they kept making references to the movers and that all the things in storage should be coming soon. honestly...it would have been more entertaining if it were a worse movie. it wasn't bad enough to be a ""good-bad"" movie but wasn't good enough to be ""good"" either. get the mst3k version...it's more fun.",0

"i saw and liked the first two a lot, really. especially because the second is not just a try to make another one as good as the first. and it's a story standing alone. you don't have to know the first movie. i liked that in the ""free willy"" movies, too.  but... the third, here is absolutely useless! i tried it with a friend of mine, because we both liked the first two. we decided to stop after a good half an hour. the movie is okay, there are funny parts in it alright. but what for? timon and pumba were funny creatures in the first two movies. what lion king 1 1/2 is for me is: a hard attempt to get even more fun of the first movie than it had already, plus telling the story from their point of view. but what for? i'd really like to know. you know, the idea of the two of them sitting in the cinema watching the first one, is really nice. but what comes after is mostly unnecessary. i guess many people liked timon and pumba, and so do i really. yet, for me many parts were very constructed with a try to be funny. no chance, most of it wasn't funny at all, at least for me. btw. what was the movie about anyway? was it a) about timon and pumba or b) an attempt to get more fun out of the first movie? i tend to choose option b and i'm very disappointed about it.  if you like to see stories like: ""the story behind xy"", you should see ""rosencrantz and guildenstern are dead"" by tom stoppard with tim roth and gary oldman. that's really funny and no try to get more out of ""hamlet"" then it has.",0

"ah, the sex-and-gore movie. it's too bad they don't make these anymore (unless you live in japan). but if they all turned out like this, that is not a bad thing.  the movie basically consists of the two lovely vampires picking up ""johns"" along a country road, taking them home to their castle, having crazy sex with them, and then eating them (except the first victim, who they keep around for no particular reason). things are complicated when a woman camping with her husband becomes too curious about these mysterious women she keeps seeing. it gets real ugly from here. by the end, the two vamps are in such a bloodlust that they're eating everything in sight, and manage to let their captive victim escape. oops, so much for that secret existence.  the fact that the two vampyres don't mind taking their clothes off and fooling around with each other is the only thing this movie has going for it. otherwise, it's a bloody, confusing mess (why is their tomb so far away from their castle?), watchable only for the scant few minutes of vampyre playtime. the only thing i got out of this movie was these two valuable bits of advice: shooting lesbians will not kill them; it will only turn them into vampires, and, don't pick up hookers along a country road; they are probably vampires. other than that, it really wasn't worth my time.",0
"flynn, known mostly for his swashbuckling roles (and his bedroom antics!) takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully. playing real-life boxing champ jim corbett, flynn turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled san francisco bank teller to a celebrated pugilist, all the while setting one eye on society deb smith. he and best pal carson attend an illegal bare-knuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men (and a dog!) including a prominent judge. the next day, he gets a chance, via smith, to gain entrance to the judge's private club. he uses this opportunity to weasel his way into the good graces of its exclusive members and land a spot as the club's resident boxer. his unusually adept skill in the sport soon has him taking on all comers, up to and including the world champion john l. sullivan (bond.) flynn is downright magical here. he is the epitome of charm, charisma and appeal in this role. he looks terrific (especially in a hangover scene with his hair mussed and wearing a white union suit) and does virtually all of his own stuntwork (impressively!) his line delivery is delicious and he is credible and sympathetic and at the same time duplicitous and rascally. smith exudes class and taste from every pore and is a good match for flynn. at this stage, he needed a female costar who could stand up to his advances and reputation (he was undergoing statutory rape charges at the time) and she does so admirably. she is repulsed by his freshness and cavalier attitude, yet can hardly help but fall under his enchanting spell. bond is incredibly burly, brawny and towering, yet tender when the script calls for it. amusing support is provided by a young and ebullient carson. frawley is his dependably cantankerous self as flynn's manager. the rest of the cast is excellent as well including flynn's rambunctious family and an assortment of stuffy nob hill types. the whole thing is beautifully appointed and securely directed. a few of the sets are amazingly presented. some of smith's gowns border on the garish, but she suits the upswept hairstyles very well. it's a terrific glimpse into the earliest days of championship boxing, but it's also so much more. some of it (like the character traits shown by flynn) is enhanced or exaggerated for entertainment purposes, but a lot of it is authentic (like the methods and costumes shown in the fight scenes.) one line is particularly memorable: ""i believe you like me more than i like you, but it's entirely possible that i love you more than you love me."" it's classic romantic dialogue (and there are more than a few zingers sprinkled throughout the script as well.)",1
"after reading all of the rave reviews about this film and a few that give it a so-so. i finally decided to throw in my no cents worth. i agree with most on the point that if it hadn't been for lauren lewis and chris ferry it would have been a disaster. filmed in mariette oh. just north of dogpatch where all the real talent fled south down i-77 years ago, at least as far as a tank of gas would allow. i did get a chuckle from reviewers who subtly claim that they cerebrate a little better than most by claiming they followed the plot without an inkling of confusion. this wee tale by the brothers crook is like an old record with a skip in it. as an american i understand the difficulties ind film artists have to face. a trip to romania would have wiped out the budget for sure. lets face it this whole film was a loop de loop of claire in the gas station, claire on the side of the road, claire under the bleachers, claire in the house, claire in the cornfield, claire at school. claire here and claire there. it almost became monotonous and would have if she had not been the best actor in the cast. josh and jeff have to make a living but don't write a two page script and turn it into an hour,twenty flick. before writing another screenplay about dreaming ghosts watch an episode or two of ghost whisperer or something and get a little background. all of the cast except the above mentioned and a couple of others were engaged in their first and last film. also, there is an appearance by co-director jeff as he is in all his films. just like alfred hitchcock, eh? one thing the film had going for it is that the cameraman seemed to have a fixation on lauren lewis' derrière. well, with all sarcasm now satisfied i still recommend the film for the horror buff just to see this young actress in the formative time of her career (i hope)and that chris ferry has established himself as a villain worth watching.",0
"i have begun to melt so i will make this review as short and sweet as possible.  there's this astronaut, and he goes up in a spacecraft with two other guys, ya know? except something happens that exposes him to radiation, and then when they come back...well, never mind what happened to the other guys, but our astronaut has begun to melt! no, not just burn up, but melt! like an ice cream cone in july! well ok maybe not that fast, but ya know what i mean.  anyway, he gets all red & gooey, and the fact that he's melting makes him really mad. i guess he also checked out the ""melting man"" handbook because suddenly he knows that in order to keep from totally melting away, he has to eat human flesh, so he starts ripping people apart.  there are other characters, but in a movie where a man melts and melts and melts (and melts), do you really need any others? what's important is who will he munch next, and what will be left of them? how long will it take for him to just melt away to nothing? why was this movie made in the first place? where did they get the money? when will you fall asleep while watching it?  i've very nearly melted, but i still have enough time left to tell you that this movie is dreadfully boring, even though the idea is really cool and kind of gross. the makeup is neat but everything else is...splat",0
"i was so excited to see this film because i had always heard it was very scary.  what's interesting about it is that it is a japanese film they decided to bring to america, but they actually filmed it in japan with the original crew! i think this made the film... more japanese (which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most japan-to-america horror movie flops) but it also made it a bit inaccessible to american audiences. the difference in what scares the japanese culture and what scares the american culture felt present throughout the film. this worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character: a frightened fish in a big, busy, unfamiliar, tokyo pond.  the storyline was quite confusing as well. in typical japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing. the beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until, at the end of the film, we see the ending and beginning of the whole story. this constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me. also, i didn't think some things were explained so well and i had to ask my friend to explain them to me (she had already seen it, as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the story).  overall, there is plenty for american audiences to love, tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes.",1

"watching the first 30 minutes of sands of oblivion gave me high hopes. it seemed i was in for a cheaper version of the mummy. the setup was promising, in the 1920's cecil b. demille makes his opus of the ten commandments. it seems in using real egyptian artifacts for the movie set they unleashed an ancient and terrible evil (don't they always?). aware of what had been unleashed demille orders the entire set buried instead of the usual practice of tearing it down. hopefully the evil will be buried with it for all time. then we switch to present day where a team is attempting to excavate the site (the movie's first mistake, but hey those period costumes are expensive and this is a sci-fi channel movie). the first sightings we get of the anubis monster are well done and it's a costume that they put some effort into and not the usual cheesy cg effect. then the body counts starts. this is were the movie went south for me. the reactions to the fact that people are dying in gruesome and strange ways gets a strangely subdued reaction. once they realize that the ancient evil has again been unleashed and is on a killing spree what do the stock issue leading man and lady do? they make the usual stop to the ""guy who knows the truth but never told anyone"". after getting that vital information do they share it with the comrades at the dig site? no, they stop off at a hotel for a refreshing shower and some pleasant small talk. really i'm not the most motivated person but if i knew a demon from ancient egypt was on the loose and killing everyone in sight and would be coming after me i'd put a little hustle in my step to solve the problem. after this overlong and pointless middle section they get around to destroying the anubis monster in the usual way, by racing around in dune buggies and shooting it with a rocket launcher while it's standing by a pile of phosphorous grenades. for a sci-fi movie it was above the usual crap they put out, which isn't saying much at all. what disappoints me is this could have been a lot more if someone had wrote a decent script for it.",0

"forest whitaker's performance is all the more impressive for making it almost worthwhile to sit through this dreck. ""historical fiction"" does not justify changing history. the absurdity begins from the ground up with the imaginary lead character played by james mcavoy. to create a fictional observer for the purpose of giving the reader a point of connection in the book is regrettable, regrettable that white people can't just read a book without a white protagonist to connect to, but at least he was placed in a somewhat passive role. making up a fake historical actor and crediting this fiction with exposing amin to the world is irresponsible, lazy and stupid. not making the actions of this creation believable or even sane is just criminal, and has opened the door for movies like the one they're planning to make with leonardo dicaprio as a heroic enron whistleblower who never existed. the logic of the world does not apply in this film where some scottish kid thinks its okay to sleep with the wife of a murderous dictator. it doesn't apply where the wife of the dictator desires to sleep with some stupid scrawny irresponsible white boy. for that matter everybody is lined up to sleep with this scrawny, irresponsible, arrogant white boy, he even has gillian anderson licking her comely chops.  let me declare, i do not like james mcavoy. i'm not sure what it is about him, but i thought his mr. tumnus in narnia was creepy and pervy. i think that kerry washington would never look twice at him so i can't believe that the wife of a powerful dangerous man like amin would risk and lose her life for him. i don't believe him as a doctor, and i just don't see the appeal. his character seems to have far more arrogance than would make sense, and trying to make him look like a badass in shooting the cow was just...there's that word again...absurd. think about it, you are watching all of these characters bend themselves into knots in order to accommodate this unbelievable main character and there never was such a guy.  gillian anderson looks incredible and sounds more british than most brits. whitaker gives a great expansive magnetic performance, and highlighted, with his incomprehensible pre-oscar speeches, just how much he was acting. it's a shame the film around him had no reason to exist.",0
"chris rock, apparently desperate for a cozy star-vehicle which would cross his appeal over to white and mainstream black audiences, updates the hit 1978 comedy ""heaven can wait"" with an urban agenda. he plays a struggling comedian involved in a car accident who has his soul removed too soon from his body--consequently, his angels must find another body to place him in, and can only come up with that of a white businessman. rewriting a movie as bland and sentimental as ""heaven can wait"" only shows that rock's eye was on the box-office (this was strictly a corporate move organized by the most mercenary of hollywood players). why not strive for something loftier or more memorable than a silly reincarnation comedy that culminates with an evening at the apollo? terrific supporting cast (including the usually-reliable regina king, the wonderful mark addy, wanda sykes, eugene levy, and terrific frankie faison) do what they can, but rock seems awkward and unsure of himself throughout. *1/2 from ****",0
"men of honor has many great aspects to it. good action sequences, plenty of ""feel good"" scenes, a good musical score, but the part that really makes the movie is the great acting. mostly by robert deniro. the story of men of honor is focused about carl brashear played by cuba gooding jr. who wants to be the first african american deep sea diver in the navy. it chronicles his rough struggle from being a poor farmer to getting into diving school and even further. it is a good story, but it seems like it has been done many times before. a person, against all of the odds, won't give up until they accomplish their goals that they set for some sentimental reason many years ago. it could happen, but a lot of the struggles the brashear faces in the movie are questionable including the c.o. of the diving school tampering with his final test. however, all of that is made up for the scene when robert deniro finally enters the movie. deniro plays mater chief sunday who is the teacher at the diving school brashear is attending. as soon as deniro come in he omits this vibe of extreme arrogance that you can't hate unless you have incredible wilpower. before the movie ends, deniro gives off multiple speeches that would have you laughing at how cool he is but you are too stunned at the way he punches them out. in the end you must doubt some of the aspects of the film, but admit it, if it was all the truth, it would have you snoozing it your seat by the first twenty minutes.",1
"i was quite surprised to read some of the comments on this work, honestly. some people were looking for a plot??? ok, when this video came out over a decade ago, i watched it for what it was: a collection of music videos. it's not a movie. it doesn't have a plot, nor a central storyline. it's a rather artistic anthology of mostly long-form videos, all of them rather smartly or creatively done. michael jackson may be considered a freak these days, but, after all, this was the man who gave us thriller (considered by many to be the greatest music video of all time) and set trends with billie jean and beat it. with moonwalker, he and the filmmakers and artists who collaborated with him once again took his music and dance moves to create some vividly entertaining stuff, incorporating claymation, special effects, live performance footage, and even self-parody (the ""badder"" sequence). and for those wondering what joe pesci was doing there, this video came out just a tad before he became a household name, and was one of his most memorable appearances on film. and, imho, i think the smooth criminal sequence (the choreographed section) beats anything else michael jackson did up to that point!",1
"harem suare is the best film i saw in the year 2000. bravo ferzan ozpetek. sensually shot and stunningly portrayed, harem suare is a bold film that tackles interracial romance, which is such a taboo in hollywood. women of all shapes, sizes, and color, populate the film. cut off from the outside world, the women entertain each other by telling stories about intrigue, rivalry and jealousies within their ranks.",1
"a different look at horror. the styling differences between american and russian films is interesting. however from my american perspective this movie just wasn't that good. the protagonist, marie played by anastasia hille wasn't a pleasant character and i had a hard time identifying with her. she was disagreeable most of the time and confused for much of what little time was left. also too much time was spent in bringing her to the main location of the film. then a long time passed before any real suspense built up. once that happened it seemed volume was used as the main effect which was more annoying than anything else. the concept was more original than most direct-to-video movies and they didn't use sex to make up for a thin plot. all in all i'd recommend it for renting, but not for theater goers.",0
"i must admit i'm a little surprised and disappointed at some of the very negative comments this film seems to provoke. i think its a great horror/sci fi film. colonel steve west (alex rebar) returns to earth after an historical space flight to saturn. while in space he contracted some bizarre and unknown disease. he wakes up in a hospital bed, he looks in a mirror and before his very eyes his face is melting! escaping the hospitals supervision, he hides out in some local woods surrounding a small town. unfortunately he starts to develop a rapidly growing hunger that can only be satisfied by eating other people. he must feed on human flesh and drink the blood of others to survive! stalking human prey he begins his reign of terror! its up to his old friend dr ted nelson (burr debenning) to find him and try and help him. he has to work alone as his boss general perry (myron healey) wants it kept ultra quiet. nelson can't even tell his wife judy (ann sweeny). however, sheriff blake (micheal alldredge) becomes suspicious as general perry turns up just as some of the local townspeople start turning up half eaten. i don't really understand why this film gets such negative reviews, what do people expect? anyway, i really like this film. the star of the film are unquestionably rick bakers special make-up and gore effects which for the most part are excellent, and the fact their all prosthetic effects and no rubbish horrible cgi makes them even better. writer and director william sachs isn't afraid to use them either, we get some nice long lingering close up shots of the incredible melting man and they hold up very well, even now. photography, music and direction are a little bit dull, but professional enough. the script manages to create some sympathy for the the monster, shots of him looking longingly into ted nelsons house, or when he sees his own reflection in some water and reacts violently. the ending, set in a large factory of some sort, is pretty downbeat so don't expect any happy ending. which surprised me. also, the script doesn't really do anything with the premise, he just walks around melting and killing, with his friend trying to stop him, maybe a bit too simple. personally i think the worst bit of the film is near the start when the fat nurse runs down a hospital corridor in slow motion, her screams are also portrayed in slow motion too, it looks and sounds totally ridiculous! you need to see it to believe it! i like this film a lot and recommend it to 70's and 80's horror/sci fi fans. a bit of a favourite of mine.",1
"had the original casting idea been kept (hunting rutger, not ice-t), this movie might have worked. sadly, racism had to come into the picture (literally) and mess it up. the predominantly black production staff couldn't allow the antagonist be black, so they swapped rutger's and ice-t's roles. this was only the start of the downward spiral of this film. ernest dickerson's news-room approach to 'directing' only verified that this was another affirmative-action job assignment. master shot, close up, close up. gads, 'who's line is it anyway' even uses more creative camera work. eric's rewrite of 'the most dangerous game' is at least an attempt at modernizing the classic tale, but fails to give us any motivations for why the characters are doing this. we are never given the reasons, other than ""no one will miss these people"", why the leader (re-written as rutger) does these things. aside from a heart-felt performance by john mcginley, and a fair job by charles dutton, do not bother with this one. one small bit of trivia, there was a real drunk-driving accident during filming that injured f.murray abraham, and resulted in the death of the intoxicated young driver that caused the accident.",0
"worst film ever, this is a statement that people here on imdb often throw around. whether it's an uwe boll movie, bad classics like manos the hands of fate or the latest no brains summer action fest from michael bay, people are often quick to jump to the sudden conclusion that on the board they're posting that there is nothing worse in the movie world.  i envy these people, because they're blissfully ignorant and unaware of how deep the rabbit hole of crap movie making really goes. there are films out there so bad, so hideous, so unintentionally hilarious and so ridiculous that cults form around them to celebrate their awfulness and their discussion boards are the kindest places on the internet due to everyone agreeing unanimously that said film is really that bad.  ladies and gentlemen, i present to you ben and arthur, an 85 minute gay epic that is so utterly bad that it's a lot like a violent car crash, you know it's awful but you can't stop looking at it. the brainchild of self proclaimed ""hollywood actor, director"" and may i add beached whale sam mraovich, this film is legendarily terrible. let me give you a hint of how ego driven this project was. mr mraovich not only directed this film, he wrote it, produced it, executive produced it, scored it, edited it and then finally starred in it. this is a man so blinded by his own ego and so believing of his non existent genius that like someone with an ugly child he fails to recognise just how catastrophic his bastard creation really is.  everything in this film fails on an epic level, the acting is the worst you will ever witness, the plot is the most ridiculous, the editing and cinematography is the most amateur and even the music is like nails on a chalkboard. i'm aware i've gone on a bit of a tangent here, but please believe me that this film is really as bad as i describe it, i would say this film is horse crap squished into a film reel, but the truth is it wasn't even shot on film, it was shot on a digital camcorder not much better than the one sitting in your closet right now gathering dust. don't get me wrong, i forgive low budgets for films provided the concept is interesting, for example as much as i disliked it the blair witch project proved that low budgets can still lead to an atmospheric interesting film. ben and arthur does not have a good concept to fall back on, even if this film was shot on a budget of 20 million with hollywoods finest actors it would still suck, the plot is that atrocious, and the characters are even worse. one of the main characters arthur who is portrayed by non other than sam mraovich is one of the most whiny loathsome little turds ever put in a film. you'll dislike him within 5 minutes of the start of the film and by the end of the film that hate will have turned into outright loathing. apparently mr mraovich forgot that we're supposed to root for the hero.  i don't want to spoil all the gut busting hilarity you'll experience watching this film (which i urge you not to pay for) so i will give you two tame mild examples of how stupid this film is, tame and mild as in amongst the least offending mistakes in the movie. in one cut we hear one of the main characters say how ""they know a good lawyer and will give him a call"" the shot fades out then fades back in and this him they spoke of earlier is actually a woman, quite a spectacular mistake to make in post production i think. the second is simple, seconds after seeing this transsexual lawyer the characters are told to fly to vermont, we then cut to a shot of a plane landing amongst palm trees in a sunny area. i've never been to vermont personally but i'm certain you won't find any palm trees there.  imagine this kind of stupid amateur inconsistency stretched to nearly an hour and a half combined with ridiculous dialogue and plot and then multiply it by 10 and it still won't fully prepare you for ben and arthur. imagine the absolute worst film you've seen in your life and imagine it being even worse and you still won't be on the same level as ben and arthur, this film is really that bad.  however we should be glad in a way, films like this are a true rarity. they give us hope that one day we can become film makers ourselves or that we can be screenwriters. simply because we'll have a new found sense of confidence due to the fact that we'll know that nothing we produce no matter how amateur could be as much of a suck fest as this.  the real worst movie of all time has finally been discovered, and it is called ben and arthur.",0
"these two men went thru hell and beyond and have produced the movie that conveys the terror that many did not survive. this is definitely a movie about survival, but not without it's touching moments.  the finest piece of work i have seen documenting the 9/11/01 tragedy of new york city.",1
"of course, he did have to invent everything about cinematography, film directing, etc. before he could make classics like ""the gardner,"" so i suppose he may be forgiven this initial excursion into mere sociological documentary. today we call them ""home movies,"" and they are just as boring now as this one is",1
"if my grandma did films they would probably do much better figure than this one... incredible bad... the main characters (the mom, the dad and son) are ok. specially the mother she's a nice actress and the kid also proves to be a nice one specially on the scenes where he is supposed to be scary. but does the the director know the meaning of the words plot point, triller and good script. the script hasn't any evolving atmosphere to become a suspense thing. if you like being chased by trees you can probably enjoy it, otherwise just stay at home and sleep. oh... actually there was something funny: the movie's from 2001 but we couldn't realize it since the image is so bad (like on mini-dv) and the cars are so old (like 70 and 80's).",0
"while a bit preachy on the topic of progress as the saving grace of mankind, this is still a stunning film that presages the science-fiction special effects blockbusters that would take another 40 years to arrive on the silver screen. it predicts the global chaos of wwii, but expands on the premise by having the conflict last 30 years, and then tells the epic tale of man's struggle out from under the rubble and into the wilds of space. the acting seems wooden and strangely sterile, but this is perhaps a result of its contrast with the visuals which must have been utterly breathtaking at the time of the movie's release, and which still impress today. this is a film not to be missed by anyone at all interested in the sf genre.",1

"i went into the straight story expecting a sad/happy type drama with nice direction and some good acting. these i got. what i wasn't expecting was an allegory for the trials of human existence. leave it to lynch to take a simple story about a 300 mile trip on a lawnmower and turn it into a microcosm for the human condition.  if you didn't notice, watch it again, paying attention to the ages of the people alvin meets, the terrain he's driving through, the reactions people give him, the kinds of discussions he has (one of the first is about pregnancy and children, one of the last is outside of a cemetery). the last road he drives down is particulary haunting in this context, as it narrows and his fear and nervousness mount. the last mechanical failure could be seen as a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his engine relating to an afterlife, in which he achieves the desired reunion.  i only hope some of the people who branded this as a slow sappy melodrama take the time to watch with a more holistic attention.",1
"where to begin. this movie started out as something that seemed like a rip-off of ""darkness falls"". an old , disfigured woman living in the woods, giving kids presents for their teeth. sound familiar? then it changes. in ""darkness falls"", the tooth fairy only killed you if you saw her. the tooth fairy in this movie killed you no matter what. why did they need the rocker, his hippie girlfriend or the bubbas and their sister? i think the movie would've been fine without them. it seems like the producers sat around and decided that they needed to put extra people in the movie just so the tooth fairy would have people to kill. although, it's nice to see a pretty blonde girl not being portrayed as a bubble-head for a change. okay to rent, but i wouldn't suggest buying it.",0

"in short, the movie had a little bit of a weak 1st act with some forced acting and a somewhat disjointed rhythm and pacing, somewhat of a decent 2nd act that managed to build some tension and intrigue despite some inconsistent pacing and some inferior performances by the cast, and the 3rd act ... there virtually wasn't any 3rd act!  regarding the 3rd act, the movie just abruptly ends. there is no resolution and no path down from the climax of the 2nd act, so there wasn't much of a 3rd act. the bad guys die and that's that; the end credits roll. there is nothing to show what happens to the protagonist and the supporting characters and so on. the audience would've likely left the theater after the movie, asking ""that's it?"" a real letdown.  music was composed by david bell which worked adequately enough to serve the film most of the time, but it's certainly nothing outstanding. it's just functional, but achieves this by being merely generic and derivative. it is also apparent that the score is very dated with the use of synthesized timpani for some of the percussion. what least impressed me about the score is that some moments of tension heralds music cues sounding like they were ripped off of james horner from ""48 hrs."" and ""commando,"" particularly the brass.  in all, the film had potential as the basic story itself is good, but the execution was lackluster with mediocre direction, weak acting, and somewhat inconsistent pacing.  there was virtually no 3rd act to properly finish the story, and this omission is major and unforgivable as it doesn't allow the movie to end satisfactorily. this could either be the screenplay or, possibly, the production had to cut out filming or editing the 3rd act into the finished movie due to budget constraints (but i'm speculating as to why there isn't a 3rd act). whatever the reason, the abrupt ending really hurts the movie overall.   this is good for a view if you're curious and you can get the movie for very cheap as well as to learn the reason why you need to have the 3 acts (beginning, middle, end) if you write screenplays and make movies.  otherwise, you might not want to waste your time unless you can get the mst3k version to at least get some laughs out of it.",0

"despite being quite far removed from my expectations, i was thoroughly impressed by dog bite dog. i rented it not knowing much about it, but i essentially expected it to be a martial arts/action film in the standard hong kong action tradition, of which i am a devoted fan. i ended up getting something entirely different, which is not at all a bad thing. while the film could be classified as such, and there is definitely some good action and hand to hand combat scenes in the film, it is definitely not the primary focus. its characters are infinitely more important to the film than its fights, a rather uncommon thing in many hong kong action movies.  i was really quite surprised by the intricacy of the characters and character relationships in the film. the lead character, played by edison chen (who is really very good), becomes infinitely more complex by the end of the film than i ever thought he would be after watching the first thirty minutes. the police characters also defied my expectations thoroughly. in fact, the stark and honest portrayal of the seldom seen dark side of the police force was quite possible my favorite aspect of the film. i don't know that i would say dog bite dog entirely subverts typical notions of bad criminal, good cop, but it certainly distorts them in ways not often seen in film (unfortunately). so many films, especially hong kong action films i find, portray police in what is frankly a very ignorantly idealized light. this is one of my least favorite things about the genre. i was pleasantly surprised to see that dog bite dog actually had some very unique, and really quite courageous, ideas to present about the police force. there are negotiation scenes in this film that i have never seen the likes of before, and doubt i will ever see again, and am sure i will remember for quite a while. also, the criminal characters are shown from an interesting perspective as well, there is some documentary footage in the film of cambodian boys no older than ten being made to fight each other to the death with their bare hands, which i thought was one of the film's most powerful and moving moments. it says a lot about the reason these guys are the way they are, rather than simply condemning them. also, the relationship between chen's character and the girl he meets in the junk yard reveals a lot about his character. it wasn't until this element entered the film that i really started to see the film as an emotional experience rather than only a visceral one. there is something about most on screen relationships that doesn't quite get through to me, but for some reason this one really did. the actress does an incredible job with this role which i imagine was not easy to play.  dog bite dog also features some really breathtaking cinematography, all though it is unfortunately rather uneven. there were some moments that i found really striking, particularly in the last segment of the film, but there was also a good deal of camera work that was just ok. another slight problem i had was with the pacing, which i also felt was uneven. i found a lot of the ""looking for a boat"" scenes to be a little alienating, all though it quickly picks up after that. the action scenes are short and not too plentiful, but are truly powerful and effecting, particularly towards the end. the fight choreography is honestly not all that impressive for the most part, all though to its credit it is solid and fairly realistic, but the true strength is the emotional content behind the fights. the final scene, while not a marvel of martial artistry or fight choreography, is one of the most powerful final fights i have ever seen, and i've seen quite a few martial arts films.  i suppose the biggest determining factor of whether or not one will get much out of dog bite dog is whether or not you can connect with the characters. all of them are certainly some of the more flawed characters one is likely to see in a film of any kind, but there was something very human about all of them that i couldn't help but be drawn to and really feel for them, particularly chen's girlfriend. i should say that i doubt most people will like the film as much as i did simply because i imagine that most people will not like or care about the characters in the same way, but i still recommend it highly all the same. it is truly a deeply moving and effecting film if you give it a chance.",1

"the woman in black (1989) is a tv adaptation of susan hill's modern classic ghost story, published only a few years earlier than the film was made. sadly, this film has not been released on dvd, and as far as i am aware it has been deleted on vhs. it's availability is in direct contrast to it's popularity amongst those in the know about horror films. the story revolves around events in a seaside community in the early 20th century where a young solicitor is sent by his firm to conclude the affairs of a recently deceased widow, who died on her isolated marshland estate. what he thought would be a routine and probably tedious task turns into a nightmare as he discovers that the old woman was haunted to her death, and that the ghosts of her past are not content to rest. the story is told in a subtle but concise way, never being self-indulgent, flashy or over-expositional. the obviously tight budget may have contributed to the no-nonsense approach, but it's just what the story needs, and why it works so well. it's what you don't see that scares. having said that, there is one particularly terrifying scene that relies on the visual, and it works to perfection. i watched this film during the day, and it still gave me nightmares nearly a week later. if you love being terrified, do what you must to get hold of and watch a copy of the woman in black.",1
"the premise of this awaited sequel was really good and after the huge success of the remake i expected a lot sincerely.  the sad truth is that this movie is really absurd and inept. the situations are dumb and beyond reason and the acting is truly awful.  this time there aren't likable characters or violins unlike the remake. also, the gore is not that abundant and when it happens it's truly bad.  the violence is minimal and it's a shame because there are many arguments that make you think that there's room for heavy violence. i mean, there's a swat team that is hunting a family of cannibal mutants. you surely expect something different! when i watched it on the movies i wanted my money back.  anyways this is a clear example of how rushed out movies turn out to be a mess and demonstrate poor quality on all aspects.  a mess that let down the fans of the remake like me. that's why sequels are never welcomed; at least this movie isn't as terrible as the 1985 sequel to the original.",0

"aside from the great movie metropolis, this is about the oldest pure sci-fi movie. while at times the film is a bit preachy and the acting can be a bit broad, it is a great film for two reasons. first, it is extremely original in both style and content. even in the 21st century, there are no films i can think of that are anything like it. second, for its time, the special effects were absolutely incredible--using matte paintings, models and huge casts to create amazing scenes of both a post-apocalyptic world and a vast city of tomorrow. sure, you could sit back and knock the film because, by today's standards, the effects are only so-so. but, you must appreciate that this was state of the art when the film came out in 1936 and it must have really amazed audiences. in many ways, the sets look highly reminiscent of the ""modern cities"" featured at the 1939 world's fair.  i think the movie is also interesting because it seems torn by the question ""are people really that stupid or are we destined for greatness?"" the end result seems to be a little of both! how true!  a final note: i saw this twice on tv and just a short time ago on video. all three times the sound and print quality stank--particularly the sound. if this is available on a dvd, hopefully it is a lot cleaner and will provide optional captioning. as the sound on the video kept cutting out, i really would have appreciated this!",1

"so, every year there is at least one movie, that hasn't got any chance of being a box office success, because from the moment of production, even before one simple shot is filmed, everybody's picking on this movie... there is a long list of these kind of movies, and in the end, some are really bad (battlefield earth (2000)), some may have their flaws but are quite enjoyable (catwoman (2004), elektra (2005)) and then there are a few, which actually are really great for what they are, but no one admits! i mean, my gosh, just because the wide crowd does have to have a victim each year they can pick on, not everybody has to join them. so yeaaah, maybe those movies aren't perfect, but c'mon, how many movies are? not every movie is supposed to be a new the lord of the rings! not everybody will enjoy these movies, but i bet there are more than who admit they do. hudson hawk (1991), who is just hysterical funny, color of night (1994), which may not be oscar-worthy, but is definitely a not dumb at all thriller with some nice twists, swept away (2002), which i thought is a great mix of sick humor and a beautiful romance, gigli (2003), which was great entertainment with some really memorable lines and not badly acted at all from the former ""bennifer""-couple, and this year it's ""basic instinct 2""! well, when i heard the rumors of a sequel to one of my favorite movies i was very sceptically, and although i really love sharon stone i stayed sceptically until i've finally seen this movie. and really, i was very positively surprised! i can't understand why it gets such a bad press and such a bad voting here. it never simply copies the original, it has a quite clever story, has tension, action, humor and the absolutely stunning sharon stone reprising the role of her life! with 47 years when shooting the movie she looks hotter than many stars in their 20s, but it's more than her being beautiful, it's brilliantly acted, with all her looks, her famous smile, the way she speaks and moves... from the very first frame she's in you can't take your eyes off of her. it's simply a pleasure to watch her as catherine tramell, and all of the other actors deliver solid performances, too! so i really can't see what's wrong with this movie... it has a dark, thrilling, sexy and gritty look, strong performances, and you never felt bored! maybe the story isn't oscar-caliber, but it never even tries to be! it's an entertainment-movie, and by this standard it absolutely delivers in my opinion! so give it a try!",1
"plot is never the strong point of a fred astaire and ginger rogers movie, but ""follow the fleet""'s screenplay is exceptionally mediocre. fred and ginger still come off all right--they play ""bake"" baker and sherry martin, dancers whose personal and professional partnership ended when bake joined the navy. when they meet again, their love-hate relationship generates some entertaining comic moments. but for much of the movie, they take a backseat to a tedious subplot about sherry's sister connie (harriet hilliard), her love for sailor bilge smith (randolph scott), bilge's dalliance with another woman, and an old schooner that connie inherited from her father. though hilliard is rather charming, this plot is uninteresting.  but at the same time, ""follow the fleet"" is blessed with an exceptional irving berlin score that gives the stars plenty of chances to show off their talents. astaire gets two good solos with ""we saw the sea"" and ""i'd rather lead a band."" he sings expressively and, of course, dances electrifyingly--and the sailor suit makes him look a little more boyish and athletic than usual. rogers sings the catchy ""let yourself go"" and later does a solo tap-dance to the same tune.   the three duets really save the film, even though they're all shoehorned into the plot with silly excuses. fred and ginger win a dance contest by doing an energetic routine to another reprise of ""let yourself go"". later, they sing and dance ""i'm putting all my eggs in one basket"" as if it were an early rehearsal of the number, flubbing the choreography to comic effect. at the end, the movie finally figures out how to get fred and ginger in evening clothes for a romantic duet--it makes it part of a show-within-the-show. the situation is contrived, but the song, ""let's face the music and dance"", is one of the most sinuously beautiful things berlin ever wrote (it's reminiscent of cole porter), and the dancing matches it in elegance. quintessential astaire and rogers.  it would be a chore to sit through most of the dialogue sections of ""follow the fleet"" again, and, in fact, it's not necessary, because the plot rarely propels the musical numbers. but i could watch the songs over and over.",1
"a chinese ghost story stars the late, great leslie cheung as ling choi sin, a penniless tax collector who decides to spend the night at a deserted temple, where he meets and falls for a beautiful woman called tsing (joey wang). when ling discovers that tsing is actually a ghost who has been forced to seduce victims for an evil tree spirit who feeds on 'chi' (life force), he decides to try and free the girl by giving her remains a proper burial. enlisting the help of swordsman yin (wu ma), a crazy taoist monk, ling successfully defeats the tree spirit, but must also do battle in hell against the evil lord black, to whom tsing is due to be wed.  the first hong kong film that i saw which wasn't purely martial arts action, a chinese ghost story opened my eyes to the incredible world of asian fantasy horror, a magical realm inhabited by beautiful female ghosts, bumbling innocent heroes, sword wielding taoist monks, monstrous spirits, and dark lords of the underworld; i instantly fell in love with the film's exuberance, energy, humour, inventiveness and visual excellence.  two decades later, and this amazing movie still remains one of the finest examples of its genre that i have seena sumptuous, breathtaking masterpiece that brilliantly blends horror, comedy, fantasy and romance. with superb direction from siu-tung ching, excellent editing from david wu, stunning cinematography, and a whole slew of imaginative special effects (including a humongous killer tongue, a many tentacled monster, and multiple flying heads!), a chinese ghost story is a completely unforgettable and thoroughly enjoyable experience from start to finish.",1
"really it's a dreadful cheat of a film. its 70-minute running time is very well padded with stock footage. the rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes. the plot exposition is very poorly rendered. they are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together. there is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors. please don't ask.  the plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting earth five miles up threatening to destroy the earth. it's a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built h-bomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour. nothing very much here to report except for a mad speech by a scientist against the project because there might be some sort of life aboard and think of the scientific possibilities but this speech made by the obligatory idiot liberal was pretty much passé by then.  what saves this film, somewhat uniquely, is the stock footage. i've never seen a larger selection of fifties jet fighter aircraft in any other film. this is by no means a complete list but just some of the aircraft i managed to see. there's a brief interception by a pilot flying, in alternate shots, an f-89 scorpion and an f-86. first to scramble interceptors is the royal canadian air force in hawker hunters and f-86 sabre jets (or canadian built cf-13s) and even a pair of cf-100 clunks.  then for some reason there are b-52s, b-47s and even b36s are seen taking off. more padding.  ""these canadian jets are moving at 1200 miles an hour"". i don't think so since one of them appears to be a ww2 era gloster meteor, the rest f-80s. the meteors press the attack and one turns into a late f-84f with a flight of early straight wing f-84s attacking in formation.  there's a strange tandem cockpit version of the f-80 that doesn't seem to be the t-33 training type but some sort of interim all-weather interceptor variant with radar in the nose. these are scrambled in a snowstorm.  an angled deck aircraft carrier is seen from about 500 meters. it launches f-8u crusaders, f-11f tigers, a-5 vigilantes and a-3 skywarriors. the air force scrambles f-86s and f-84s and more f-89s then you've ever seen in your life as well as f-100 super sabres and f-102 delta daggers.  the f-100s press their attack with sooooo much padding. the f-89's unload their rockets in their wingtip pods in slo mo. the f-86s fire, an f-102 lets loose a falcon, even some f-80s (f-94s?) with mid-wing rocket pods let loose. there is a very strange shot of a late model f-84 (prototype?) with a straight wing early model f-85 above it in a turn, obviously a manufacturer's (republic aviation) advertising film showing the differences between the old and the new improved models of the f-84 thunderjet. how it strayed into here is anybodies guess.  there is other great stock footage of ottawa in the old days when the capital of canada was a wide spot in the road and especially wonderful footage of new york city's times square during one of the civil defense drills in the early 50s.   i think we also have to deal with the notion that this was filmed in canada with the possible exception of the auto chase seen late in the picture as the pacific seems to be in the background. the use of a jowett jupiter is somewhat mind-boggling and there is a nice tr 3 to be seen also. canada must have been cheap and it is rather gratuitously used a lot in the background.  as far as the actual narrative of the film there is little to recommend it other than the mystery of just who ellen parker is giving the finger to at the end of the picture. and she most definitely is flipping someone off. could it be, r as in robert loggia? the director who dies before this film was released? her career as this was her last credit?  its like the newspaper the gift came wrapped in was more valuable than the gift.",0
"spoilers ahead, but does it really matter? have you ever read a movie review composed entirely of questions? could this be it? why did an ancient civilization bury artifacts all over the world? why is this question never answered? why was the opening text crawl incoherent? why would a nun (she sure seemed nice!) hand over 20 orphans to a madman? has there always been a gold mine in downtown vancouver? why does one of the gold mine's shafts exit in the front yard of an orphanage? why does tara reid's character suddenly show up at christian slater's apartment for sex?

"as a forty-something urban explorer/photography and longtime fan of the original kolchak: night stalker series since my early childhood, one aspect that hasn't really been mentioned is the amount of urban exploration carl's character undertook during the series. he always managed to get himself in to one great abandonment, sewer or tunnel after another. armed with only his trusty penlight (okay, so he had some flares in the primal ape episode tunnel) and his camera, he never carried any other gear to either protect himself or make the exploration easier.  like many here, i recently purchased the dvd box set of the two pilot movies and subsequent tv episodes, and have been slowly revisiting all the shows. and although i remember watching them back in the early 70s when they first aired, its been over 30 years passed...so many of them seem new all over again. campy, dated and cheesy - but charming and highly entertaining. they just don't make stuff like this these days. now its all regurgitated spin-offs with predictable characters and plots.  thankfully, my 16-yr-old daughter has been sitting down to watch the episodes with me and has developed an appreciation for them (she enjoys the genre). it gives me hope and faith the series will carry on to new generations of fans for years to come.",1
"sisters in law will be released theatrically on march 24th in sweden. a good occasion for our nordic friends to discover this original and thoughtful documentary. it was shown in göteborg together with a retrospective dedicated to kim longinotto, ""director in focus"" of the festival. she gave a master class, very much appreciated, telling about her method as documentary filmmaker and told the audience about the special circumstances which led her to shoot sisters in law twice : the first version got lost for good, so a second shooting was organized and the film turned out to be different at the end. a pretty awful problem happened, in this case, to create the possibility of a very strong movie.",1
"robert taylor as the mad buffalo hunter charlie gilson is the main character in this film. at the beginning i was thinking that charlie would end up redeeming himself like john wayne in the searchers or james stewart in the naked spur. but as the film goes along gilson keeps doing more atrocities until you realize there is no hope for him. stewart granger is sandy mckenzie, who wants to stop hunting because he realizes that the buffaloes will soon be gone and he becomes disgusted by the act of killing. gilson is a natural killer who makes no distinction between animals or human beings. debra paget as the indian girl is a surprising character considering the self imposed censorship of that time. she lies with gilson in total resignation even though she hates him. the last scene of a frozen gilson, is unforgettable.",1
"what a shame that a really competent director like andre de toth who specialized in slippery, shifting alliances didn't get hold of this concept first. he could have helped bring out the real potential, especially with the interesting character played by william bishop. as the movie stands, it's pretty much of a mess (as asserted by reviewer chipe). the main problems are with the direction, cheap budget, and poor script. the strength lies in an excellent cast and an interesting general concept-- characters pulled in different directions by conflicting forces. what was needed was someone with vision enough to pull together the positive elements by reworking the script into some kind of coherent whole, instead of the sprawling, awkward mess that it is, (try to figure out the motivations and interplay if you can). also, a bigger budget could have matched up contrasting location and studio shots, and gotten the locations out of the all-too-obvious la outskirts. the real shame lies in a waste of an excellent cast-- hayden, taylor (before his teeth were capped), dehner, reeves, along with james millican and william bishop shortly before their untimely deaths. few films illustrate the importance of an auteur-with-vision more than this lowly obscure western, which, in the right hands, could have been so much more.",0
"when you actually find a video game to be scary or disturbing, you know that the developers have done some very serious and hard work to make the whole thing work. undying used the unreal engine but had very little resemblance to that game when it came to actual gameplay. speaking of gameplay, the pace is slowed down and the sheer difficulty in progressing through the very hard to kill enemies makes for a very unqiue gameplay experience. the production values are so high that you may even forget that it is a video game. the game itself is also packed with loads of secrets that you have to uncover using special vision. the level design in fantastic and the weapons as well as the enemies will really shock you.",1
"full house came to me when i was about 9. i remember seeing re-runs of america's funniest home videos with bob saget, and one day my mom told me that he was also in a show called full house. one day, i was lucky enough to catch an episode while visiting family. it didn't seem too interesting at first, but as i watched more and more, ever night at 9:00, i would just be so into it.  this show really makes you want to be there yourself, hang out with the girls, go places with them, and maybe even join in their little family ""sing-alongs"".  the thing i like most about full house is that it's a great show for kids and adults of all ages. there will be some parts that are more for adults, then parts that are meant for kids, so that the whole family will enjoy it. no matter how cheesy it can be, it's still a great show, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone.  10/10",1
"when john wayne filmed his alamo story he had built a complete alamo set in the town of brackettsville, texas which is still there and quite the tourist attraction. as long as that stands, we will have a set for future alamo interpretations for the screen. one such with dennis quaid and billy bob thornton was done in this century.  but i would say the alamo: thirteen days to glory is the best alamo story filmed i've seen. john wayne's film is a good one if over-hyped, but it's a john wayne film with the story redone to fill parameters of screen character of john wayne. brian keith plays davy crockett here and gives a fine interpretation of the rollicking frontier character he was.  it's a lot closer to professor lon tinkle's book on the alamo than the wayne film was and having read the book years ago i can attest to that. tinkle's book is listed as the source in both films, but tinkle who was alive back then when the wayne film was done and he was not pleased with the result.  alec baldwin was around the right age for young william barrett travis, the idealistic freedom fighter who incidentally was a slave owner. back in the day no one saw the ironic contradiction in that. one thing that was not explored and hasn't been was travis's hyperactive sex drive. he was the casanova of the southwest, he even kept a salacious diary of his libidinal conquests.  but the man who always gets the whitewash is jim bowie, played here by james arness. he was a hero at the alamo to be sure, but his career before the alamo was that of a scoundrel. he was a smuggler, a slave trader, an all around con man selling land he had questionable title to. but his heroic death certainly redeemed him. no hint of that is in arness's portrayal nor any others i've seen of bowie on the screen. and of course he did design the bowie knife, done to his specifications. that man needed such a weapon.  however the main asset that the alamo: thirteen days to glory has is a full blown portrayal of antonio de lopez de santa anna, the president of mexico who comes up personally to put down the rebellion stirred up by the north americans who've come to settle in texas at mexican invitation. unfortunately those americans came with some pre-conceived notions about liberty that just hadn't made it that far south, at least liberty for white people. raul julia plays santa anna who remains an even more controversial figure in mexican history. he was also quite the scoundrel, but he was the best mexico produced until a genuine reformer named benito juarez came along.  this film was the farewell performance of lorne greene who appears briefly as general sam houston. greene's not quite my conception of houston, he really was way too old for the part, houston was in his early forties in 1836, he was not yet the patriarch of texas. but within the limits imposed on him, greene does a fine job.  for a romantic telling of the alamo tale by all means see john wayne's version, but for historical content i recommend this film highly.",1
"i first saw this film as a teenager. it was at a time when heavy metal ruled the world. trick or treat has every element for a movie that rocks. with a cast that features skippy from family ties, gene simmons of kiss and ozzy osbourne as a preacher, how can you go wrong? backwards evil messages played on vinyl! yes thats right, they use records in this movie. in one scene eddie (skippy) is listening to a message from the evil rockstar on his record player when things begin to get scary. monsters start to come out of his speakers and his stereo becomes possessed. as a teenager i tried playing my records backwards hoping it would happen to mine. almost 20 years later trick or treat is still one of my all time favorite movies.",1
"this movie can be interpreted on many different levels. don't listen to the other comments bashing the movie and saying that it is a played again story or w/e and that it is just about drugs. it has very overt superficial metaphors about drugs; however, the rest of the movie (and why i think it was personally made) is really not about that at all. it is really mocking psychology and the conditioning of society. it shows, for a split second, that the main character's brother is watching those sick videos online. why? my interpretation is that it is to demonstrate that all of this gruesomeness that we are exposed to makes it easier for us to be mechanical in our professions instead of seeing people as people. as far as the scene about logic, it is also reaching out to the people who were in the federally mandated 1% smart classes who are confused and frustrated because life isn't as predictable and mathematical and logical as it seems on a macroscopic level. you have to apply heisenberg's uncertainty principle (along with all the other laws and principles of uncertainty) not just to physics but to life and leave room to change your plans and adjust along the way. one of the best movies i have ever seen. it just might go way above your head; it isn't for you it is for those people who are are having trouble coping with life not working out like a math problem. when you are critically analyzing a movie or writing your critical review's try not reading the back cover first (written by marketers and parapsychologists)",1

this film is self indulgent rubbish. watch this film if you merely want to hear spoken gaelic or enjoy the pleasant soundtrack. watch for any other reason and you will be disappointed. it should be charming but isn't - it's just irritating. the characters are difficult to care about and the acting is poor. the stories within the film are also charmless and sinister. i was expecting a heartwarming family film but this also held no appeal to my fourteen year old daughter. it is rarely that i cannot see a film through to its conclusion but this one got the better of both of us.  although the film is set in current times it has the look and feel of a cheap east european film made during the cold war. there isn't even enough in the way of beautiful scottish scenery and cinematography to redeem it. a real shame because as a film this is an embarrassment to scotland.,0
"must have to agree with the other reviewer. this has got to be the worst movie, let alone western i have ever seen. terrible acting, dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic (let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s), and oh, did i mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters? i was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene. and the ending? the least i can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the movie...completely awful. and yes, it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable ""let's remember when"" shots when a main character dies. luckily i saw this on free tv. don't waste your time.",0
"i was really stunned how much a film, that's over 60 years old could impress me. it is nearly two hours long, there are absolutely no stars in it, there are subtitles but nevertheless it is interesting and exciting to watch. what impressed me mostly was the realism of the film. you could nearly feel the coldness of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. this is a relief in a cgi-world like ourdays. i wondered how much work this must have been for van dyke. i read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. now who wants to talk about 'titanic' anymore? it's a great film with a great message and i would recommend it to future directors to see how great and realistic movies can be if they are only directed with realism instead of visual effects.",1

"this is a review of 'freddy mercury the untold story,' theatrical release, chicago int. film festival, 2007 one of the phoniest, uninspired and most tedious biographical documentaries i have seen. if the film i saw in a movie theater was originally released on tv, i would plead with its producers and distributors to not fool a paying audience with the false promise of a cinematically worthy documentary feature. even as a made-for-tv documentary, the sentimental piano solos accompanying interviewees sitting in front of flower arrangements in hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narration rang more true of a sleepapedic bed infomercial. the only redeeming aspects of this ""the untold story of freddy mercury"" -- or, uhm, was it ""the untold story of princess diana"" are the original concert, video and tv footage -- unabridged freddy mercury and queen. testimonial interviews with irrelevant eye witnesses with insights, such as: ""he was a free spirit,"" (really.. i thought freddy mercury was a company man...) belittle those freddy testimonials, by brian may or montserrat caballe that shed new and affectionate light into mercury's complex life and character. and... what up with the harry potter-like boarding school segments? how did the interview with the first girl-crush (""...who now works in a travel agency"") and members of freddy's first school band contribute to what i really want to know about mercury? vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and growth, queen, the band remain unexplored. these filmmakers don't ask a single, provocative question, nor do they engage in independent or visionary research of their subject, instead delivering a tedious montage of politely clean and vastly empty comments about an enigmatic and brilliant rock legend, who doesn't deserve to be remembered by this history channel biography your grandparents can doze off to on a sunday night.",0
"just because an event really happened doesn't mean that it will make a good screenplay/ movie. the cat's meow, by peter bogdanovich claims to be based on actual events which happened on a cruise hosted by william randolph hurst. the writer paid more attention to creating a bizarre cast of characters than taking time to create a story for the bizarre characters to inhabit. the key moments of the story seem implausible; for example, when hurst accidentally shoots the producer, believing him to be chaplin. basing a key element of a story on someone wearing the wrong hat is trite and contrived. the story attempts to be a dark comedy, but the cat's meow misses an important piece of this equation, comedy. there is also a lack of empathy for any of the characters. it hardly matters who is shot, who is killed, who is guilty and who is innocent. there is not a strong character to cheer for. as a result the conflicts are difficult to care about and the eventual outcome is incidental.",0
"at one end of the eighties warren beatty created and starred in the literate epic reds about the founding of the soviet union as seen through the eyes of iconoclast radical john reed. it was a profound film both entertaining and with a message presented by an all star cast. at the end of the decade warren beatty created another kind of epic in dick tracy that makes no pretense to being anything other than entertainment with a whole bunch of the best actors around just having a great old time hamming it up under tons of makeup.  that both reds and dick tracy could come from the same individual speaks volumes about the range this man has as a player. in this film beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters from the strip and put them in one original screenplay.  the city's top mobster big boy caprice is making a move to really eliminate competition. the film opens with him rubbing out lips manlis's henchmen in a valentine massacre style shooting and then lips himself being fitted for a cement overcoat. but caprice's moves are making him a target for tracy.  in the meantime a third mysterious and faceless individual is looking to topple caprice himself. will our hero sort out this thicket of crime?  the spirit of fun this film has is truly infectious. when people like al pacino, dustin hoffman, paul sorvino, william forsythe, r.g. armstrong get themselves outrageously made-up to look like the cartoon creations of strip author chester gould and then indulge in an exercise of carving the biggest slice of ham, you've got to love this film.  al pacino got a nomination for best supporting actor, but any of these guys could have, it's only that pacino as big boy caprice gets the most screen time. only beatty plays it completely straight, the others all seem to play off of him. dick tracy won oscars for best art&set design, best song written by stephen sondheim and introduced by madonna, sooner or later. the fact he was even able to get somebody like sondheim to write a score for this film only shows sondheim wanted to get in on the fun. as for madonna, the material girl does more than hold her own with all these acting heavyweights as club torch singer breathless mahoney.  before this film, dick tracy movies were consigned to the b pictures and worse as saturday afternoon serials. the only thing that rivals this all star extravaganza is a radio broadcast done for armed forces radio during world war ii that got to vinyl. can you believe a cast like bing crosby, bob hope, frank sinatra, dinah shore, jimmy durante, judy garland, frank morgan, and the andrews sisters? try and find a recording of that gem.  until then warren beatty's classic comic strip for the big screen will do nicely.",1
"how this has not become a cult film i do not know. i think it has been sadly overlooked as a truly ingenious comedy!  ""runaway car"" attempts to pass itself off as a fast-paced thriller, but taking the quality of acting (good god it's bad), the storyline, the practicalities of the car's demonic possession and the baby evacuation scene into account there is nothing you can really do but laugh. and laugh you will. films are made to entertain us, and the degree to which they do this can be an indication of a film's worth. this film is the pinnacle in entertainment, i laughed from beginning to end. at one point i got short of breath and nearly choked, it really is that funny at some points. when the baby was airlifted out of the sunroof in a holdall by a helicopter with a robot pilot who managed to maintain a constant velocity identical to the car and a perfectly flat flight plain that meant the grapple hook didn't rip the car roof to pieces, i was laughing hysterically. but when the baby starting swinging around in the air, nearly hit a bridge and almost got tangled up in a tree, tears were running down my face.  it also occurred to me that the black cop was the guy who played jesus in madonna's ""like a prayer"" video. he seems to get everywhere.",1
"i thought the racism and prejudice against carl brashear was grossly overdramatized for hollywood effect. i do not believe the u. s. navy was ever that overtly racist. i cannot imagine a full captain, the commanding officer, ever telling his chief to intentionally flunk anyone. certainly not at the risk of his life. and there has never been a chief petty officer as unabashedly prejudice against everybody but wasps as deniro's character. no chief as slovenly and drunken as he was played would have ever risen to master chief in the first place. cuba gooding saved an otherwise badly done movie.",1
"otto preminger's noir classic works almost as a flip-side of laura...while that film was glitzy and features the high fa-luting clifton webb, this film is a whole lot seamier. dana andrews is a less than good cop who accidentally kills a man only to have it potentially pinned on the father of the girl he loves. preminger keeps things moving at a brisk clip so that lapses in logic are easily overlooked. andrews is quite fine (a lot less wooden than he's been in the past) and the stunningly beautiful gene tierney is stunningly beautiful! creepy craig stevens plays the unlucky victim. where the sidewalk ends is a must see and a terrific companion-piece to preminger's equally lurid whirlpool (also starring tierney).",1
"the first review i saw of page 3 said ""what is madhur bhandarkar finally wants to say?"". should he say something so decisive.  the most beautiful thing about page 3 is it doesn't take sides. no propaganda whatsoever. this is the film that captures so many angles of an issue(i don't know what do i call as an ""issue"" here) and yet like any mediocre movie doesn't come up with an solution. i was so intrigued when i realized that the movie ended almost in the same scenario just like it started.  the movie defines so many characters who are completely with completely different priorities and different ideologies and yet they are all a part of the system which is all the more apathetic. i wish i can say more but there would be more spoilers ahead. so watch page 3 if you wanna see one of the most mature films of the recent times.",1
"this review is dedicated to the late keith moon and john entwistle.  the original drum and bass.  there seems to be very little early who footage around these days, if there is more then lets be 'aving it, now-a-days it tends to be of a very different kind of who altogether, a parody, a shadow of their (much) better years. to be fair, not one of them has to prove anything to anyone anymore, they've earned their respect and with overtime.  this concert footage for me is one of their best. to command an audience of around a 400,000 plus strong crowed takes skill, charisma, wit and a whole lot of bloody good music.  we all know of the other acts on the bill, the doors (their last ever show weeks before jim morrison died), moody blues, hendrix, taste, free and many more. the point being that whoever were there it was the who that the majority had come to see. this show was one year after the great hippie fest of the 1960's; woodstock. the film and record had come out and so had the who's greatest work to date, tommy. the ever hungry crowd wanted a taste, to be able to experience their own unique event, to be able to ""grove and love"" in the knowledge that this gig was their own. to do this you needed the best of what rock 'n roll had to throw at the hungrily baited crowd.  at two 'o clock in the morning in late august 1970 the m.c. announces, ""ladies and gentlemen, a small rock 'n roll band from shepherds bush london, the 'oo"".  john entwistle's body suit is of black leather, on the front is the out line of a human skeleton from neck to toe, roger dressed in his traditional stage outfit of long tassel's and long flowing hair, keith in a white t-shirt and jeans, as pete had his white boiler suit and doc martins that he'd preferred to wear.  the who never stopped their onslaught of high energy rock for over two hours, performing theirs and other artists' greatest tracks such as young man blues, shaking' all over, and then as on queue, keith baiting the crowed to ""shut up, it's a bleeding opera"" with tommy, the rock opera. the crowed went wild. this is what they had come to hear, and the who didn't disappoint, straight into overture and never coming up for air until the final note of ""tommy can you hear me?"" amazing.  to capture a show of this magnitude of a band of this stature at their peak at a festival that was to be the last of its kind anywhere in the world was a fantastic piece of cinematic history.  the english dvd only comes in a soundtrack of english/linear pcm stereo, were as in the states, i think, you can get it with 5.1 at least, ""check local press for details"" on that, okay.  the duration of the dvd is 85 minutes with no extras, which is a disappointment. yes, for a slice of rock and festival history this dvd would send you in a nostalgia trip down memory lane the moment you press play, for some of the best who concert footage as it was meant to be, live, raw and in your face!  i would have given this dvd ten if it wasn't for the lack of 5.1, and some extras would have been nice.  thanks roger, pete, john and keith.",1
"although there are a lot of familiar ""television"" names associated with ""a man called sledge"", there is nothing extraordinary about the film itself or about any of the performances. in fact, the only thing that distinguishes it from a 1960's-70's television series like ""the rat patrol"" is a bigger cast and a lot more violence.   james garner is the biggest star and apparently thought he should try to break away from all the light comedy stuff he had been doing (""maverick"", ""support your local sheriff""-""gunfighter"" etc.). unfortunately his earthy likability works against him, as sledge is a humorless character written to cash in on the popularity of clint eastwood's spaghetti western character. but eastwood's stuff was not this flat and uninteresting.  i suppose that ""a man called sledge"" could be classified as a spaghetti western although the pacing is too slow to really fit that sub-genre. fans of the slow-paced ""combat"" television series will feel an instant connection as vic morrow directed the film and co-wrote the script with frank kowalski. throw in some then trendy slow-mo shots and cross-dissolves, which call attention to themselves rather than serve a story-telling purpose.   the plot is the standard ""big heist"" thing (insert ""the war wagon"" here) with sledge plotting how to heist a $300,000 gold shipment. his gang includes claude akins and dennis weaver. the problem is that while on the move the shipment is guarded by 40 outriders and while stopped it is locked in a vault inside the territorial prison. i think there was an episode of ""alias smith and jones"" with the same plot.  the story would make a decent hour of television but gets old very fast as a very padded feature length film. garner does not allow any of his charm to leak into his characterization and the film does not generate enough suspense to hold a viewer's interest.  the thing finally crashes and burns shortly after the heist when the gang engages in a contrived and totally illogical card game.   then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.",0
"what is wrong with you people, if you weren't blown away by the action car sequences and jessica simpsons hot body then you are majorly screwed in the head. of course the film isn't a masterpiece, i don't think it was aiming to be. it was fun and funny, i never watched the show when i was younger, i only recently saw one episode, and when i watched the movie, i felt it had the same kind of atmosphere. the movie seats were practically shaking, and the car sequences were good because it didn't bore me and drag out like some of the scenes in 2fast 2furious. and jessica simpson is plain hot, i just wish they had used her more in the action sequences. all in all, i had a hell of a time watching this and i would go and see it again soon and i will buy it on dvd. people, enjoy it for what it is.",1
"seven pounds stars will smith as ben thomas, an irs collection agent who has an ulterior motive for meeting those who have gotten behind on their tax payments. thomas caused the deaths of seven people whilst driving talking on his phone and the movie follows his attempt to try and atone for his, quite frankly, unforgivable crime.  the story line is as subtle as a brick through a green house window. what you see is exactly what is happening - even the ending of titanic was more surprising when compared to seven pounds. there is absolutely no twist whatsoever, there is never any confusion or doubt as to what is happening.  normally i only like will smith when is in full bad boys mode. the guy is at his best when sporting a gun, driving a ford gt and saying ""aw hell nah"" as whenever he tries to act serious it only comes across as a pathetic attempt at trying to gain an oscar which he is so obviously is desperate for. this is probably the main reason why i wasn't looking forward to the movie, although here he is very understated. there are flashes of comedy but they are subtle, in fact it was the most understated will smith performance i have ever seen and for that reason alone he was fantastic and ironically should be nominated for a major award.  the supporting cast were all grand too - rosario dawson looked pretty much at deaths door the whole film and woody harrelson and barry pepper were fine as where all the other bit players.  overall it is a weepy - but it isn't throwing all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no other choice but to cry. there were a few times that even my hardened heart nearly broke. you will be hard pressed not to find one of the situations that does not relate to your own life which makes it seem all the more real.  i would give it 8/10. the will smith show moves onto drama without all the desperation of the pursuit of happiness and comes of all the better for it.",1
"i remember this movie in particular when i was a teenager, my best friend was telling me all about this movie and how it freaked her out as a kid. of course being the blood thirsty gal that i am, i had to go out and find this movie. now i don't know how to put this without loosing credibility, so i'm just going to say it, i actually had fun watching this movie! i know that it's stupid, not the best story and beyond bloody and gruesome, but that's what i was looking for and the dentist delivers in the scares, blood, sex, and crazy psychopaths. sometimes i just need a fun movie like this to just let loose and get grossed out by.  dr. alan feinstone is obsessed with order and cleanliness. on the day of his wedding anniversary, he spies his wife brooke having sex with their filthy pool man, matt. at his dental practice, feinstone's first patient of the day is young jody saunders, there for his very first dental appointment. feinstone begins to clean jody's teeth. everything goes smoothly at first, until he imagines that jody's teeth are brown and rotten. his dental pick slips, stabbing jody in the gums. jody's mother picks up her crying, bleeding child and leaves angrily. feinstone sees his second patient, beauty queen april reign. alone with april, feinstone sedates her with nitrous oxide so that he can fill a cavity in one of her molars. as she drifts off into unconsciousness, feinstone imagines that she has transformed into his wife. he begins kissing and fondling her on the dental chair, then begins to choke her. april starts to cough and half-wakes up from the gas. feinstone snaps out of his trance and quickly re-buttons april's blouse. feinstone decides to end the day early and sends his staff and patients home. later that night, brooke meets feinstone at his practice. he reveals his new italian opera-themed patient room. he encourages brooke to try out the room's dental chair. when she does, feinstone binds her to the chair and sedates her with nitrous oxide. with operatic music blaring in the background, he begins to pull out brooke's teeth. feinstone has gone off the deep end and is definitely not going to let anybody stand in his way of cleanliness.  honestly, as silly as this movie sounds, i did have a lot of fun watching the dentist. the best scene without a doubt is when he teaches that nasty irs agent a lesson in hygiene that i'm sure he'll never forget. man, i don't think i've brushed my teeth so much after i watched the dentist. yeah, i am going to warn you, this movie is in no way for the faint of heart, it's very bloody. there's stabbing, gun shots and just these brutal dental torture scenes that will make your stomach turn. yet somehow i just enjoyed this movie, if i ever want just a good gore movie that was made for true horror fans, i slip it in my dvd player, and that's the ""tooth"" lol! i am so funny! um, yeah, i try, give me a little credit.  7/10",1

"generally it was a good movie with an ideal ending; the acting was spectacular and the characters didn't stray from their persons. i especially liked the plot, although you knew what was going to happen it still gave the element of surprise through out the entire movie. however, i find that coming on to the ending it could have been a little longer (extended maybe)- to me it seemed like it was rushed a bit; as if the writer was trying to take linens off the lines before the rain fell. for instance- what happened to tristan's brother, hayden? for all we know he died in the hospital. maybe he was the one that setup the entire thing?! who knows! maybe there will be a sequel? maybe? if there is.. i cant wait to see it.",1
"as a low budget enterprise in which the filmmakers themselves are manufacturing and distributing the dvds themselves, we perhaps shouldn't expect too much from broken in disc form. and yet what's most remarkable about this whole achievement is the fact that this release comes with enough extras to shame a james cameron dvd and a decidedly fine presentation.  with regards to the latter, the only major flaw is that broken comes with a non-anamorphic transfer. otherwise we get the film in its original 1.85:1 ratio, demonstrating no technical flaws and looking pretty much as should be expected. indeed, given ferrari's hands on approach in putting this disc together you can pretty much guarantee such a fact.  the same is also true of the soundtrack. here we are offered both dd2.0 and dd5.1 mixes and whilst i'm uncertain as to which should be deemed the ""original"", the fact that ferrari had an involvement in both means neither should be considered as inferior. indeed, though the dd5.1 may offer a more atmosphere viewing experience owing to the manner in which it utilises the score, both are equally fine and free of technical flaws.  as for extras the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. take a look at the sidebar on the right of the screen and you'll notice numerous commentaries, loads of featurettes and various galleries. indeed, given the manner in which everything has been broken down into minute chunks rather than compiled into a lengthy documentary, there really is little to discuss. the 'anatomy of a stunt' featurette, for example, is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of pieces. as such we get coverage on pretty much ever aspect of broken's pre-production, production and post-production. and whilst it may have been preferable to find them in a more easily digestible overall 'making of', in this manner we do get easy access to whatever special feature we may wish to view.  of the various pieces, then, it is perhaps only the commentaries which need any kind of discussion. then again, there's also a predictable air to each of the chat tracks. the one involving the actors is overly jokey and doesn't take the film too seriously. ferrari's pieces are incredibly enthusiastic about the whole thing. and the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. of course, we also get some crossover with what's been covered elsewhere on the discs, but at only 19 minutes none of these pieces outstay their welcome. indeed, all in all, a fine extras package.",1

"users who have rated this movie so highly simply can't have seen enough good films to compare it with. have they all been brainwashed?? i have rarely felt so disappointed by a film and some of that must be attributable to the ridiculous hype surrounding this movie.  from the first, bu is just a chase film. we pick it up at the end of one chase and go straight into another. and another. and another. and another. do you see a pattern emerging? there is virtually no time 'wasted' on plot, character development, or boring old reality.  if you haven't see the other two bourne films, you're pretty lost. if you have - you only wish you were lost - somewhere a long way from a cinema.  paul greengrass's dispassionate style worked exceptionally well on united 93 which was a sentiment overload desperate to happen, but on bourne and his interminable woes it just has the effect of removing the audience from involvement with the character. he runs. he jumps. he punches. he gets blown up. he clears tall buildings. yada yada yada. above all - he survives. he survives like a plastic action man survives, which only makes the ridiculous stunts he pulls all the more slack and lacking in any kind of tension. so he drives off a building? so what? he'll survive. yawn.  there's a girl thrown into the mix because bourne's love interest died in a previous incarnation, but she's just decor. i've seen more character depth and snappy dialogue in episodes of captain scarlet.  bourne's own journey of literal self-discovery is dull and formless and tells us nothing we didn't know from the first movie. he was turned into a killing machine. big deal. he finds out his true identity. so what? it doesn't have any emotional resonance when it comes.  the 'twist' ending is telegraphed and weak. oh, dear, the more i think about this film the more i hate it! i've already reduced my score to 4 during the writing of this comment! i'd better end now before the slide continues.  i love a good action flick and i love a good thriller. the bourne ultimatum is neither. it's a loud, tedious series of flashy edits, ridiculous sound effects and cartoon violence.   the idea that it 'shows the way' to the bond franchise is utter crap. casino royale blows it out of the water.",0

"it was easy for sir richard attenborough to make gandhi (1982)he was merely narrating a story of a great individual who walked on this planet not so long ago. comparatively, it must have been a lot tougher for director feroz abbas khan making his debut as a filmmaker to make gandhi my father, pitting a shriveled anti-hero against an international hero, both of whom were historically real individuals, and ironically father and son. the events in the film are mostly real. mahatma gandhi lived as shown in the film, setting high moral standards for the world to follow. yet these very standards overshadowed the aspirations of his eldest son harilal to be a lawyer of repute like his father, to complete his education and get a job in india and thus provide income for his nuclear family.  the film does not debunk gandhi and his ideals. for gandhi, his mission was larger than his family's aspirations. he loved his family and cared for them, though his thoughts for their appeasement were blinkered by his ideal of caring for the masses. he stood for equality and dignity among all persons and in his view to give special undue advantages to his own son overlooking other deserving persons went against the basis of what he preached. the film looks at an unusual case of parentingwhere an idealist parent places receding goalposts for a less-than-brilliant offspring.   the film presents an unusual scenario that happened. a son marries his childhood sweetheart, upsetting his father. the father upsets his son's educational aspirations at several key junctures. the fragile link between a devoted son and a father breaks, as the son wants to stand on his own feet and care for his nuclear family. while the father gradually becomes the father of a nation, the son stumbles in valiant quest for identity and survival. his marriage breaks and seeks solace in religion, buffeting between islam and hinduism. through all his tribulations his link to his mother remains, until she chides him for being drunk.  feroz khan is essentially a director of plays making his foray into cinema. he wrote and directed the play mahatma vs. gandhi that had considerable impact on the indian theater community. the play and the consequent film were based on two biographies, one by chandulal dalal and another by nilamben parekh, the success of the staged play was an evident reason for the commercial bollywood actor anil kapoor to produce this noteworthy film. every time a good director of plays attempts to direct cinema there is an evidence of a lack of confidence with the medium. peter brook is a great director of plays, but less competent as a film director. the opening shots of khan's film promises great cinemaa derelict harilal gandhi is brought to sion hospital, bombay (mumbai) barely mumbling that his father is bapu (the popular name of mahatma gandhi), father to an entire nation. the hospital authorities do not recognize him to be mahatma gandhi's eldest son, dying in poverty and loneliness. apart from the dramatic opening, the film unfortunately merely presents a great story and some superb exterior shots of father and son meditating in silhouette. for an indian film it does present some high production qualities that go hand in hand with a lack of interest for details (the clothes of most indians in the film seem dust-free and freshly laundered, modern hairstyles of actors, and even shefali shetty playing mohandas gandhi's wife a century ago with plucked eyebrows), the bane of indian cinema. since feroz khan is a theater personality, he has invested much more effort in working with the actors in developing the characters rather than on cinematic details, somewhat like sir attenborough another person who is also a product of theater (royal academy of dramatic arts).  knowing quite well that to criticize gandhi in any manner was asking for trouble, even when there was no direct criticism in the film, producer anil kapoor took a remarkable decision of not putting up posters of the film at accessible heights in india, fearing that some one could tear the poster or disrespect it intentionally or unintentionally.   with all its mix of greatness and faults, gandhi, my father throws several questions at the viewer. is a mother-son bonding stronger than a father-son bonding in parenting? is one's immediate family less important than humanity at large? does one seek refuge in religion and alcohol only when worldly troubles are encountered? in this film, harilal buffeted by adversities runs from one religion to another, while his father quotes scriptures ""forgive them for they know not what they do"" when beaten and thrown on the ground by a south african policeman, convinced of the value of religion and convincing others as well.  the film won the best actress award at the tokyo international film festival for shefali shetty (shah) and an indian award from critics. feroze khan and anil kapoor have handled a sensitive subject very well and elicited above-average performances from the ensemble of actors. i do hope the international success of the film paves the way for some able director to film another brilliant indian play girish karnad's tughlaq some day meeting international quality standards.",1
"david arquette is a young and naive home security alarm  salesman taken under the wing of stanley tucci. arquette is a  golden boy, scoring a big sale on his first call- to widow kate  capshaw and her dopey son ryan reynolds. things are going  well for arquette, he is appearing in commercials for the security  firm and he is falling in love with capshaw.  then tucci and his right hand woman mary mccormack let him in  on a little secret- they sometimes break into the houses of their  clients in order to scare them and to get their neighbors to buy  security systems from the firm. arquette decides not to get  involved, taking capshaw to meet his family, and going through life  with a goofy smile on his face. then, someone breaks into  capshaw's home and murders her and her son. arquette suspects tucci, and sets a series of traps, resulting in a gun to his  boss' head as tucci pleads his innocence.  based on a stage play, ""the alarmist"" is not opened up well. the  scenes where arquette takes the capshaw to meet his parents  are badly played and completely unfunny. they are also out of line  with the character capshaw is playing, as she gets drunk and tells  sexually explicit stories to arquette's mom michael learned. other  than these scenes, capshaw is not given much to do, but she  does a lot with the little she is given.  stanley tucci, looking just like terry o'quinn, is a riot as the  security firm owner. he is a creep who really does not understand  arquette's moral revulsion. however, when he turns into a  sniveling whiner after arquette kidnaps him, he is hilarious. mary  mccormack seems to have been groomed for a bigger role, but  she mostly stands around and agrees with tucci. ryan reynolds  is too old to play a dumb teenager, but he is funny, especially  telling his own explicit sexual story to arquette.  the screenplay lurches from romantic comedy to dark comedy too  soon. capshaw meeting the parents is completely unmotivated,  except to give her a reason to get out of town so someone can  break into her house. capshaw and reynolds are in the film just  to give arquette a reason to take revenge on tucci.  arquette, who has proven he is a good actor, is awful here. he  relies on the constipated mugging that got him through those  at&t ads, and he is not a strong enough presence to build this  weak film around. actually, reynolds might have been a better  choice in the role.  dunsky's direction is good, nothing that will win an oscar soon.  christophe beck's light jazzy score recalls the type of film noir this  film tries to be, and it is really catchy on top of that.  despite the pluses, arquette's failure as a lead and the script's  schizophrenic quality sinks the film. i do not recommend it.  this is rated (r) for physical violence, gun violence, some gore,  strong profanity, brief female nudity, sexual content, strong sexual  references, and adult situations.",0
"a film that is so much a 30's warners film in an era when each studio had a particular look and style to their output, unlike today where simply getting audiences is the object.  curitz was one of the quintessential warners house directors working with tight economy and great efficiency whilst creating quality, working methods that were very much the requirements of a director at warners, a studio that was one of the ""big five"" majors in this era producing quality films for their large chains of theatres.  even though we have a setting of the upper classes on long island there is the generic warners style embedded here with a narrative that could have been ""torn from the headlines"". another example is the when the photographers comment on the girls legs early in the film and she comments that ""they're not the trophies"" gives the film a more working mans, down to earth feel, for these were the audiences that warners were targeting in the great depression. (ironically columbia and universal were the two minors under these five majors until the 50's when their involvement in television changed their fortunes - they would have made something like this very cheaply and without the polish and great talent) curtiz has created from an excellent script a film that moves along at a rapid pace whilst keeping the viewer with great camera angles and swift editing.  thank heavens there is no soppy love interest sub-plot so the fun can just keep rolling along.",1
"madhur bhandarkar has given it all raw. but the best part is he hasn't forgotten to give the ingredients. it has come short and crisp to the viewer and it is the audience to make the choice now. page 3 is a revelation of the naked truth irrespective of the crudeness attached to it.  madhavi (konkan sharma) is a journalist and enjoys her work. a simple and peaceful life adores her with a caring boyfriend and a nice roommate pearl. she covers the page 3 (celebrity page) of nation today, where she has a very supportive editor deepak suri (boman irani.) but life takes turn for her as she hits the first bump and takes herself away from page 3 and goes into crime bit. omigosh! a whole new world was waiting for her there. she is shocked, excited, stunned with the revelation. her reaction has resulted in losing the job. at the end she is back to page 3. now when she meets any celebrity in a party, she knows the actual looks of each, hidden under the illusive face.  the movie has a message and it is crude. the audience needs to get it in their own color. the theme and the screenplay was fantastic. there are some very good thoughts applied to prepare the audiences. like the foreplay-club is shown before the pedophiliac exhibition, the short suspense before gay-actions in bathroom. the dialogs are strong and the actors are really good at delivering it. charu mohanty's 2 words speaks volumes and he is very successful in uttering those two words with such ingenuity, it leaves an impact. the set selections could have been better. the songs don't stand anywhere; but they were needed in the background. atul kulkarni has a small role with high-impact. there were a few flaws visible. atul kulkarni explaining konkan sharma that honesty should be tagged along with intelligence. there could have been a better dialog as this sounds like a preach. the meeting between thapar and his daughter doesn't call for acting. that scene looks very unprofessional.  overall it is a must-watch movie with selective options before the pedophilia incident. that may spoil your mood.",1
"i liked how this started out, featuring some decent special-effects especially for a film 50 years old. there was some pretty impressive scenery. however, the film bogs down fairly early on with some very dumb dialog as the males all try to flirt with anne francis ""altaira morbius."")  viewing this in the '90s after a long absence, it was fun to see francis again, an actress who has done mostly television shows since this film was released....and is still acting. it also was interesting to see a young-looking leslie nielsen (""dr. john j. adams""), who i wouldn't have recognized had it not been for this voice   i watched half of this movie before the boredom came almost overwhelming and i had a strong desire to go to sleep. i appreciated them re-doing this vhs tape in stereo. but it was a weak effort. this is one those overrated film where ""elites"" think is so ""heavy"" and ""thought-provoking."" that's nonsense. it only appeared ""intelligent"" because the rest of the '50s sci-fi films were so stupid!!  some if the early scenes would have looked great on wideescreen, which i didn't have at the time of this writing. perhaps another look - this time on the 2.35:1 widescreen transfer would make me change this review.",0

"laputa: castle in the sky is the bomb. the message is as strong as his newer works and more pure, fantastic and flying pirates how could it be any better! the art is totally amazing and the soundtrack, which is reused many times after this, (im not sure if this was the first time i heard it) and evokes in me the most emotional sentimental response of any movie soundtrack. sheeta, the female lead in this movie is totally awesome and the boy, pazu is also a great role-model--he lives on his own! the plot is classic miyazaki. i won't give it away, but the end is really great. i rank this as one of miyazaki's three best with nausicaa and spirited away. also you may want to check out howl's moving castle when it comes out (sometime next year i hope) if you like miyazaki check this one out as it readily available in the usa. enjoy, piper a",1
"watching this movie was a waste of time. i was tempted to leave in the middle of the movie, but i resisted. i don't know what ridley scott intended, but i learned that in the army, women get as stupid as men. they learn to spit, to insult and to fight in combat, and that's also a waste of time (in my opinion). and, anyway, what the hell was that final scene in lybia? are they still fighting gadafi or is it that it's easy for everyone to believe islamic people are always a danger?",0
"the three main characters are very well portrayed, especially anisio by rock musician turned into first time actor paulo miklos. he is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser/invader. the film shows very well the snowball effect of getting involved in ever more shady business, the contrast and similarities between the lower and higher classes. how everyone gets carried away by greed and ambition. 9-9,5 out of 10.",1
"this flick was a blow to me. i guess little girls should aspire to be nothing more than swimsuit models, home makers or mistresses, since that seems to be all they'll ever be portrayed as anyway. it is truly saddening to see an artist's work and life being so unjustly misinterpretated. inconcievably (or perhaps it should have been expected), artemisia's entire character and all that she stands for, had been reduced to a standard hollywood, female character; a pitiful, physically flawless, helpless little creature, displaying none of the character traits that actually got her that place in history which was being mutilated here. sadder yet, was to see that a great part of the audience was too badly educated in the area to comprehend the incredible gap between the message conveyed in the film, and reality. to portray the artist as someone in love with her real-life rapist, someone whom she in reality accused of raping her even when under torture, just plain pisses me off. if the director had nothing more substantial to say she should have refrained from basing her story on a real person.",0
"dolph lundgren broods and scowls his way through this incoherent mystery/thriller that's not nearly as cool as the box would have you believe. he is actually quite good here, but the story is a mess of b-movie cliches (detectives, revenge, tycoons, hookers, s&m) that looks like it was made up as they went along. the film picks up a bit in the second half but for a more decent lundgren flick, rent red scorpion instead.",0
"how has this piece of crap stayed on tv this long? it's terrible. it makes me want to shoot someone. it's so fake that it is actually worse than a 1940s sci-fi movie. i'd rather have a stroke than watch this nonsense. i remember watching it when it first came out. i thought, hey this could be interesting, then i found out how absolutely, insanely, ridiculously stupid it really was. it was so bad that i actually took out my pocket knife and stuck my hand to the table.  please people, stop watching this and all other reality shows, they're the trash that is jamming the networks and canceling quality programming that requires some thought to create.",0
"i am a big 1930's movie fan and will watch most anything that i see on turner classic movies thats new for me. so i gave this a shot, after all it's the great harold lloyd who rivaled chaplin as a great silent film comedian. i have watched much less of lloyd's silent films then of chaplins but i have to say i'm a much bigger chaplin fan. anyway this film fell so flat for me that i didn't finish it. i can understand why his sound career was so limited, he didn't get very good material to work with. after you've seen chaplin, abbott and costello, the three stooges, martin and lewis, the marx brothers, and laurel and hardy do boxing spoofs (or violence in general), this one is very forgettable. i was also interested in watching adolphe menjou as i really enjoyed him in paths of glory but his role here also did nothing special for me. maybe they should have gotten into the boxing sooner because at least half the film (at least it seemed that way) is before he gets in a ring. i can tell there are a lot of lloyd fans here and this wont be a popular review but i must rate this as compared to what else was out there at the time, 4 out of 10. don't watch this with anyone your trying to get to like old movies as they may not watch another one with you again, very flat. for an alternative to anyone who really liked this or is looking for more little known comedies in general i recommend ""kelly the second"" made a few years earlier, another nobody becomes a boxer comedy with patsy kelly and in a supporting role charles chase. these have both been shown on the turner classic movies channel.",0
"enormous fun for both adults and children, this film works on numerous levels: there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good (yet subtle) jokes for adults.  glenn close is at her sublimely evil best as cruella (`call me ella') de ville.  after three years in dr. pavlov's behaviour modification clinic she is cured of her desire for fur  even the puppy-skin fur she had so intensely desired. she even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabits.  but it wouldn't be a dalmatian' movie without the subterfuge and machinations of cruella and you know that something will change her behaviour modification. and now she needs one extra puppy (hence 102 dalmatians) to complete her nefarious scheme this time round.  ioan gruffudd is instantly appealing as the hero of the film that runs the `second chance' dog shelter. though he was in `titanic' and in last year's television version (as pip) of `great expectations' i didn't recognize him; well, he was fifth officer lowe' in `titanic' and i didn't see `great expectations' so i am not terribly surprised.  gerard depardieu does a delightful turn as the furrier-pawn of cruella. he prances and postures in the most outlandish and outrageous of fur clothing you have ever seen  and does it well. his 'wicked witch of the west' homage is hilarious.  tim mcinnerny is superb is cruella's not-so-evil henchman  he was also alonzo,' cruella's butler, in `101 dalmatians' and you may also recognize him from all of the `black adder' brit-coms. he plays his usual bumbling, good-hearted, somewhat dim-witted character to great effect.  oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of the costuming in a film. this is unfortunate as the clothing worn by glenn close is amazing  it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is being released from the behaviour modification clinic) and worthy of such an over-the-top character. her clothing alone deserves at least an oscar nomination.  animation holds a special place in my heart  but comparing this film to the original animated film is like comparing apples to orangutans: it can't be done. suffice it to say that `102 dalmatians' is even better than the film version of `101 dalmatians' that came out in 1996. there is a lot to like here: from the sight gags, the dialogue, and the costumes to the casting - it is a good film for the whole family.",1
"i recorded this ages ago but only got round to watching it today. i have been ill so had run out of stuff to watch! i am so glad i saw it, and which i could erase my memory and watch i again for the first time. this movie is so wonderful! it reminded me very much of fried green tomatoes at the whistlestop cafe.   the story goes back in time and at the end of the movie we see what the connections are. some people have said this is a kids movie. i disagree - it may be made by disney and many characters are children, but i am 23 and i loved it! there were moments when my spine tingled. the story is unlike any other film these days, full of adventure. i have just ordered the book from amazon, can't wait!",1
"one hour, eight minutes and twelve seconds into this flick and i decided it was pretty lame. that was right after hopalong (chris lybbert) drops on his horse from a tree to rejoin the good guy posse. i was pretty mystified by the whole hopalong cassidy/great bar 20 gimmick which didn't translate into anything at all. obviously, the name coppola in the credits couldn't do anything to guarantee success here, even with more than one listed.  if you make it to the end of the film, you'll probably wind up asking yourself the same questions i did. what exactly was the hook with the gloves? what's up with the rodeo scenario? who was the stranger supposed to represent? why did they make this film?   i could probably go on but my energy's been drained. look, there's already a western called ""the gunfighter"" from 1950 with a guy named gregory peck as the title character. watching it will make you feel as good as watching this one makes you feel bad. that one i can recommend.",0

"what if somerset maugham had written a novel about a coal miner who decided to search for transcendental enlightenment by trying to join a country club? if he had, he could have called it the razor's edge, since the katha-upanishad tells us, ""the sharp edge of a razor is difficult to pass over; thus the wise say the path to salvation is hard."" but maugham decided to stick with the well-bred class, and so we have darryl f. zanuck's version of larry darrell, recently returned from wwi, carefully groomed, well connected in society and determined to find himself by becoming a coal miner.   or, as maugham tells us, ""this is the young man of whom i write. he is not famous. it may be that when at last his life comes to an end he will leave no more trace of his sojourn on this earth than a stone thrown into a river leaves on the surface of the water. yet it may be that the way of life he has chosen for himself may have an ever growing influence over his fellow men, so that, long after his death, perhaps, it will be realized that lived in this age a very remarkable creature.""   the razor's edge has all of zanuck's cultural taste that money could buy. it's so earnest, so sincere...so self-important. as larry goes about his search for wisdom, working in mines, on merchant ships, climbing a himalayan mountain to learn from an ancient wise man, we have his selfish girl friend, isabel, played by gene tierney, his tragic childhood chum played by anne baxter, the girlfriend's snobbish and impeccably clad uncle played by clifton webb, and willie maugham himself, played by herbert marshall, taking notes. the movie is so insufferably smug about goodness that the only thing that perks it up a bit is clifton webb as elliot templeton. ""if i live to be a hundred i shall never understand how any young man can come to paris without evening clothes."" webb has some good lines, but we wind up appreciating clifton webb, not elliot templeton.   zanuck wanted a prestige hit for twentieth century when he bought the rights to maugham's novel. he waited a year until tyrone power was released from military service. he made sure there were well-dressed extras by the dozens, a score that sounds as if it were meant for a cathedral and he even wrote some of the scenes himself. the effort is as self-conscious as a fat man wearing a rented tux. despite hollywood's view of things in the razor's edge, i can tell you that for most people hard work doesn't bring enlightenment, just weariness and low pay.   after nearly two-and-a-half hours, we last see larry carrying his duffle bag on board a tramp steamer in a gale. he's going to work his way back to america from europe with a contented smile on his face. ""my dear,"" somerset maugham says to isabel at the same time in an elaborately decorated parlor, ""larry has found what we all want and what very few of us ever get. i don't think anyone can fail to be better, and nobler, kinder for knowing him. you see, my dear, goodness is after all the greatest force in the world...and he's got it!"" larry and the audience both need a healthy dose of dramamine.   maugham, lest we forget, was a fine writer of plays, novels, essays and short stories. to see how the movies could do him justice, watch the way some of his short stories were brought to the screen in encore, trio and quartet. and instead of wasting time with larry darrell, spend some time with lawrence durrell. the alexandria quartet is a good read.",0
"had this film been put together a tad better, it would be up there with the best of astaire and rogers. as it is, it's a fine movie but overly long with a tedious subplot, i.e., randolph scott romancing rogers' sister, played by harriet hilliard (that's ozzie nelson's wife to you baby boomers).  astaire and scott are two navy men. scott meets hilliard the first time when she looks like a stereotypical librarian, and later on after ginger rogers has asked her friend (a blond but unmistakable lucille ball) to glamor her up. meanwhile, astaire tries to pick up where he and his old dancing partner left off. the result is some wonderful dance numbers, with astaire and rogers as a team as well as separately: ""i'm putting all my eggs in one basket,"" ""let yourself go,"" and ""i'd rather lead the band."" hilliard is sweet but a little lethargic as a plain jane turned glamor girl, although she sings her two songs well, ""but where are you?"" and ""get thee behind me, satan"" - one poster didn't care for that song, but i love the title. rogers is vivacious, and a youthful astaire is a dynamo.  the highlight of the movie comes at the end with ""let's face the music and dance,"" one of the most achingly beautiful songs ever written and certainly one of the most brilliantly executed by rogers and astaire. in it, they epitomize '30s glamor and fantasy. it is truly to be treasured and watched again and again.",1
"there is not much more i can say about this movie than all of the commentaries on page one, except - as jesse says - ""it's the berries"". all of page one's commentators wrote eloquently - as almost so as the dialog is in this movie. this just may be one of those illusive things we hear so much about, but usually are made so by the actors who deliver the lines: a beautiful script. maybe robert redford did hold strict sway onto the actors/actresses during the filming of this movie, so that the beauty of the story would not get lost.  i, too, attended church when i was very young and into my late teens. the church's pastor spoke very eloquently and quietly as the rev. maclean did in his church. that, in itself, is a totally different picture that is portrayed of southern baptist churches - no holy-rollering in my church. it was a big church, with many different programs to keep its congregation busy - the most inspiring perhaps was the music-department with its huge choir and almost classical anthems. too, the sunday evening-congregation was almost entirely younger people. are you even aware it was once safe to go to church on sunday night? how i wish it still was ! watching ""a river runs through it"" is very much like going to hear a beautiful sermon in a church whose members are fully involved in life. as has already been so beautifully written, the sermon for this movie is the open-space beauties of montana - yet, aren't there also missile-silos there, too? fly-fishing or any other activity which draws family-members closer together for a happy life - and deep understanding of one another - becomes a blessing. although you see some of the shadier aspects of life then, too, the simplicity of the story paints a lasting impression on your heart, if you let it. speakeasies and prostitutes are counter-balanced by the simple gatherings of old-fashioned, community picnics as this movie contains - in heavy contrasts to modern families taking their kids to disney land for screeching joyrides and calling it ""a day together"". there is noting wrong with that, but as ""river"" demonstrates, some of its taciturn beauty could do nothing but make life richer. this is the third film i've seen in which tom skeritt (?) plays a father, all different styles and brilliantly acted.  brad pitt, mostly an undiscovered talent except for ""thelma and louise"" and ""meet joe black"", and all of the cast-members deserved many awards. little stories superbly told will get 10-of-10 from me over any movie with violence, foul language, ugliness and ""action"". i am thinking particularly of ""crash"" and most of ""arnold's"" movies. what a savior for peace this movie is.",1
"if you like star wars/trek, come see where they got all their ideas and cinematic devices. it's my top 2 favorite movies of all times, other-worldly-futuristic and psycho-thriller. the intensity of the root material (shakespeare's ""the tempest"") is not overshadowed by whizbang gimmickry (a la later lucas). and just because it was made in 1956, don't assume you can 'see the strings' holding the flying saucer up. this was the first movie where you couldn't. miracle it was made at ""a-movie"" scale, economics and tastes at the time were stacked heavily against it. and director wilcox's previous 'hit' was ""lassie come home"". until i looked him up, i assumed 'fred wilcox' was a pseudonym for a director who was already or later became famous, but at the time didn't want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a ""b"" genre back then. this was either a very very visionary production, or a very fortuitous 'mistake' on the part of the folks who bankroll hollywood.  there are the massive-scale mattes with live action almost microscopically inserted that lucas used extensively. there are intelligent machines that transcend the stereotypical 'user interface'; ""computers"", as they've come to be portrayed much less futuristically in later works. star trek's 'transporter' is there, visually, almost unaltered by roddenberry 10 years later. and if the trek/wars technobabble turns you off, fp's scientific references are not overdone and are all accurate, even today. the ""ship"" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, as good as anything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything 'trek' has done, for tv or film. we didn't get to spend as much time there as i would have liked.  if you ever wondered how movies got into space so competently, watching fp will explain all that. it's definitely not 'wagontrain to the stars'.",1

""airplane"", ""the naked gun"" trilogy, ""blazing saddles"", ""high anxiety"", and ""spaceballs"" are some of my favorite comedies that spoof a particular genre. ""pandemonium"" is not up there with those films. most of the scenes in this movie had me sitting there in stunned silence because the movie wasn't all that funny. there are a few laughs in the film, but when you watch a comedy, you expect to laugh a lot more than a few times and that's all this film has going for it. geez, ""scream"" had more laughs than this film and that was more of a horror film. how bizarre is that?  *1/2 (out of four)",0
"the 1960's were a time of change and awakening for most people. social upheaval and unrest were commonplace as people spoke-out about their views. racial tensions, politics, the vietnam war, sexual promiscuity, and drug use were all part of the daily fabric, and the daily news. this film attempted to encapsulate these historical aspects into an entertaining movie, and largely succeeded.  in this film, two families are followed: one white, one black. during the first half of the film, the story follows each family on a equal basis through social and family struggles. unfortunately, the second half of the movie is nearly dedicated to the white family. admittedly, there are more characters in this family, and the story lines are intermingled, but equal consideration is not given to the racial aspects of this century.  on the whole, the acting is well done and historical footage is mixed with color and black and white original footage to give a documentary feel to the movie. the movie is a work of fiction, but clips of well-known historical figures are used to set the time-line.  i enjoyed the movie but the situations were predictable and the storyline was one-sided.",0
"on second viewing of this movie, i like it even more than the first time. it is full of nuances and a perception of life as being quite ordinary and often fearful but what lifts this movie to a height rarely realized is its focus on the little incidences in our lives to which we normally only offer the briefest of attention spans. here the movie spins into the celebration of these incidences, the meeting of a tow truck driver and client, the jogger hearing a baby's cry from the bushes. the dialogue, acting, casting and direction are superb. no two by fours, no grand revelations. what i did observe was how true the characters were to their basic natures and how enhanced their lives became when these were celebrated. kudos to all involved in this, we need more ""grand canyons"" in our lives. 9 out of 10.",1
"""the lady in question (1999)"" starring gene wilder is a well-acted mystery drama that reminds me of the old black-and-white raymond burr perry mason series. both perry and ""cash"" kept me guessing right up to the end. there were many suspects with a motive for the murder, but i had no idea which character it would be.  gene wilder has a special charming wit about him, even in his facial expressions and vocal inflections which make him perfect for the part. the portions of the movie which portrayed actors acting was done very well. i'm sure this is an additional challenge for the cast to pull off. i am not surprised to see that he did some of the writing for the movie. even his singing was a delight. i like him in this role more than his former ""sillier"" roles like ""the young frankenstein"" and ""willy wonka."" i am hoping a & e will continue this series. they ought to call it something like ""the a & e gene wilder mysteries.""  the music fit the period. i enjoyed the cool live combo and the swing tunes. i was a little unclear at the beginning whether we were seeing a flashback or whether the action was taking place in that time period. and i do not agree that the inclusion of profanity is necessary to the flow of the script. to me, that always distracts.  overall, my wife and i thoroughly enjoyed this second in a well-crafted start in what we hope will be many others -- just like one of our other favorites: raymond burr's perry mason.",1

"i am a fairly big fan of most of the films that have been based on stephen king's books - this one rates as one of the scariest and most memorable.  i have just finished rewatching it for about the tenth time and i still find it heart-wrenching as well as scary.  the scene where gage is on a sure collision course with the monster truck is one which stands out. and the ""no fair"" uttered by little miko hughes near the end is a touch of brilliance.

"in order to hold the public's attention for three hours, we were treated not so much to a family's romp through four generations and 120 years of hungarian history, as to sexual liaisons with a sister, a sister-in-law and other adulteries. oh yes, there was also a totally gratuitous rape. having said all this, the first story of the relationship among the children of the patriarch was fresh and sensual - thanks to jennifer ehle.",0
"in the first one it was mainly giant rats, but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too. this one, however, is just giant rats period, well giant rats and one really growing little boy. this one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer rats...you know how it is. this movie has some kills and its moments, but i find it to be on par with the original, i just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies. well, that is not true...i actually like ""empire of the ants"", maybe i just do not care for giant rodents. all in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre. i just can't recommend this one.",0
"you know how star trek fans flocked to all the star trek movies, even the really bad ones? why? to see their heroes in action one more time. that's the way i feel about doc savage. i am a major fanatic for the character, and the prospect of seeing doc and his crew in an adventure was overwhelming. and the first 20 minutes of the film only heightened that feeling of anticipation. then they decided to crib elements from a number of doc adventures and throw them into this one movie, resulting in a somewhat disjointed film. there's a lot of promise in here, diluted by a number of unfortunate choices (the music, the ""camp"" elements, etc.) but the spirit of doc is there, and that's what those of us familiar with doc and his crew respond to. so, in my long-winded way, what i'm trying to say is that this is not a bad movie: it's just not as good as it should have been. and anyone who is a fan of superman, james bond, indiana jones, buckaroo banzai, and many other characters ought to check this movie out just to become familiar with the hero who provided inspiration for them all.",1
"daraar got off to a pretty good start. the first scene really left me at the edge of my seat wondering what would happen next. other than that, the first half of the movie is a total bore. all the first half of the movie is about is rishi kapoor falling head over heels in love with juhi chawla. by the way, don't you think he's a little old for her???  things finally start to spice up towards the middle of the film when juhi tells us about her previous husband; and wow what a lunatic is he! he was an over-protective, neat-freak with a really hot temper! he used to beat up poor juhi for no good reason! one of the reasons i really don't like this movie is because i can't stand to see juhi (my favorite actress) get so abused. this film in general has way too much abuse and bloodshed; i find it so sickening!!!  anyway, all i'm trying to say is if you're thinking about renting daraar, you should put it right back on the shelf where you found it and pick something else!",0
"there's a good reason that walter pidgeon is warning off leslie nielson and his crew from the relief ship, stuff he dare not dream about.  as doctor edward morbius, pidgeon is the last survivor of an expedition that came to this planet 20 years earlier. since that time he married another member of the expedition and had a daughter, anne francis. they are the only humans left on this planet which was once the home world of an ancient civilization known as the krell.  the records as deciphered by pidgeon indicate the krell came to a cataclysmic ending of unknown origin. the machinery they left behind is still functioning.  maybe functioning too well as members of the relief party start dying and in a particular gruesome fashion.   i see all kinds of speculation about a remake and this is one film not to remake because it's as fresh as it was in 1956. the terms would change, we would now say warp speed instead of hyper drive, courtesy of the enduring popularity of star trek.  we might not see the men in the relief expedition in a flying saucer like space ship. it might look a lot more like the starship enterprise or the ship from 2001 a space odyssey. it's interesting to look at science fiction films from different generations and see how are conceptions of the future do change.  the story behind forbidden planet is a timeless one, about mortal beings trying to play god.  you can't write about forbidden planet without commenting on robby the robot. this mechanical marvel, put together by pidgeon with the knowledge he gained from studying the krell was quite the hit back in the day. he got a new lease on life in the sixties with the character of the robot from lost in space. his scenes with earl holliman who plays the cook on the space ship and his complying with earl's request for some home spirits are very funny.  robby and the other special effects were nominated for an oscar, but lost to the ten commandments and the parting of the red sea. forbidden planet's bad luck to run up against a hollywood founder like cecil b. demille.  classicists among you will recognize forbidden planet as a futuristic reworking of the tempest which when you think about it could have been shakespeare's one venture into science fiction.   my favorite among the cast is warren stevens who's sacrifice enables leslie nielsen to learn exactly what he's dealing with.  never miss this one whenever it's broadcast.",1
"as far as spaghetti westerns go, i'd put this man can't die on the dull side of the genre. it's not that the movie is particularly bad, but it lacks the brilliance and flash of some of the other sws i've seen. guy madison does his best in the lead role, but lacks the on-screen charisma necessary to pull it off. with one notable exception, the rest of the cast isn't particularly good. the direction is uninspired and offers very few moments that i haven't seen before. there's just not much to get very excited about.  the cast exception i mentioned is rosalba neri. she's the one bright spot in this otherwise mediocre film. unfortunately, her screen time is limited to less than 15 minutes. (note: the imdb page for this man can't die is wrong. rosalba neri does not play jenny benson. instead, she is the character melin. i'm not sure how anyone could mistake rosalba neri for some guy named john bartha as listed in imdb's credits for the movie.)",0

"here goes the perfect example of what not to do when you have a great idea. that is the problem isn't? the concept is fresh and full of potential, but the script and the execution of it lacks any real substance. it should grab you from the start and then pull a little on your emotions, get you interested and invested in the characters. this movie doesn't have what it takes to take off and sustain flight, and here is why. first you don't really care about the characters because they are not presented in a way that people can relate to, i mean this is not superman or mission impossible here, it's suppose to be about normal people put in a stressful situation. they are not believable in the way they act and interact. example : jeffrey combs as a cop over chewing is gum, frowning and looking intense all the time isn't the way to go here. i mean what is that?, he looks like he's on the toilet or something. i loved him in re-animator and the way he was playing the intense/neurotic, unappreciated medical genius was right on the money. but not for this, he tries too hard to over compensate by looking so intense and on edge but in a still mild neurotic manner, it's not natural, i'm surprised he didn't dislocate his jaw during filming. the movie is basically on life support, it barely has a pulse and it kept me waiting for something that would never come.",0
"""in the world of old-school kung fu movies, where revenge pictures came a dime a dozen, it took a lot for a film to stand out -- and even more to make it a fan favorite after all these years. what is arguably chang cheh's finest movie continues to hold influence over the hong kong movie industry, from the themes of loyalty, brotherhood and revenge as explored by john woo (who got his start in the hk movie industry working for chang) during the heyday of heroic bloodshed during the late 1980's, to more modern movies like a man called hero, which sports a character in a costume inspired by this film. the influence has also carried into other areas as well, from music such as the wu-tang clan, tv commercials for sprite and video games such as ""mortal kombat."" so what makes this movie so special? the plot -- on the surface -- is pretty simple. it deals with members of a rogue group known as the ""poison clan"" who are searching for a treasure hidden by their sifu. all of the members of the clan have extraordinary kung fu abilities, denoted by their animal styles, or ""venoms"" (the lizard can climb walls, the scorpion has a deadly strike, etc.). the twist is that since the clan always wears masks, not all of them known who the others are. thus a simple plot becomes almost a suspense thriller. we're not talking the usual suspects here, but it's far above many other kung fu movies of the time. supposedly, golden harvest was not too happy with chang's script -- like most of his movies, they felt it was too dark and violent -- and they actually wanted him to add broad comic relief to it. thankfully, chang stuck to his guns and stayed with his original script, which has since has become revered as one of the best for the films of its time, if not ever, completing an almost perfect dramatic arc and providing the perfect backbone for the extraordinary action sequences.  but what really solidifies the movie are the venoms themselves. chang cheh hit upon a magical formula with the cast -- not only did he gain talented martial artists (whose moves, competed without the aid of wires or other special effects, put most modern martial artists to shame) but great actors as well. the formula proved so popular that chang usually had one or more of the venoms in his later movies. getting back to matters at hand, in most old-school movies, the actors seem to playing out cardboard cutouts, but here the actors actually create characters. it seems that everyone has a favorite venom (mine is philip kwok -- best known to many as mad dog from hard-boiled -- as lizard) and it is this personal connection to the characters that the five deadly venoms generates which makes it a true classic of the genre. even if you're normally not a fan of old-school movies, you need to check the five deadly venoms out, if for nothing else to see where modern movies got their inspiration from.""",1
"after seeing the low-budget shittier versions of the ""universal soldier"" franchise, i hoped and prayed that van damme reprised his role as luc devoreaux in a second unisol movie. well, it seemed this prayer was answered, but not the way i hoped. universial soldier 2 is just intense as poetry reading at your local library. no, even that would be more intriguing . the fight sequences are top-notch, bruce lee quality, which is the only redeeming factor in this entire pathetic excuse for a motion picture. that and having former wcw tough-guy legend ""goldberg"" playing the villain. however, placing goldberg as seth's sidekick lieutenant would've been better.  we offended me the most was the setting of the movie itself. it's like some film school students slapped it together. the plot holes are that bigger than kanye west's ego is what really did this movie in. for example: luc's daughter, hillary looks like she's at least 11-13 years old and the first movie was filmed only seven years ago. how is that possible? tell me that! the part in which luc's partner was killed off and turned into a unisol is just re-goddamn diculous! you mean to tell me that there was an experimental unisol exposed naked in the basement of the research complex at the beginning of the movie. c'mon. the director could've spent more time with this movie like the first one and sewn all the plot holes shut. but oooh nooo!   speaking of the plot, it sucks! compared to the first movie, universal soldier 2's plot watered down and worthless. where's the gritty thrills in which a unisol goes berserk an re-enacts his last memories in a supermarket rampage thinking its desert storm or something ? this was the dawn of the millennium, you would attracted more of an audience if this had taken place in a dystopia/orwellian type of future cesspit. corny is the correct adjective to describe this sad, sad, sad sequel.   from what i seen: double impact, under siege 2, robocop 3, and hell, even the cheap-ass/no class terminator knock-off ""class of 1999"" is more entertaining than this!",0
"i found this movie thought-provoking, and its ambiguity refreshing in a world of quick-fix films where we are manipulated into loving the ""good guy"" and hating the ""bad guy."" scott cohen, a very handsome television actor, does a great job of portraying the family black sheep/lost child who aspires to gain his father's love and respect, as well as that of his widowed sister-in-law with whom he apparently has a history. judd hirsch plays against his usual good guy image as a father who triangulated his sons and now is left with the one he always rejected.  when i saw this at the tribeca film festival, i was enchanted by the lovely way the sawdust was used to portray a family tradition, as explained by the director.  this is a fitting successor to the classic ""ordinary people."" i just realized, judd hirsch was in that, too!",1

"when marlene dietrich was labeled box office poison in 1938 one of a handful of actresses so named by the trades papers, it was films like the garden of allah. how a film could be so breathtakingly beautiful to behold and be so insipidly dull is beyond me. also how marlene if she was trying to expand her range and not play a sexpot got stuck with such an old fashioned story is beyond me.  the garden of allah, one of the very first films in modern technicolor was a novel set at the turn of the last century by robert hitchens who then collaborated on a play adaption with mary anderson that ran for 241 performances in 1911-12. it then got two silent screen adaptions. the story is about a monk who runs away from the monastery out in french tunisia to see some of what he's missed in the world. he runs into a similarly sheltered woman who was unmarried and spent her prime years caring for a sick parent. she's traveling now in the desert and the two meet on a train.  the woman is of course marlene and the runaway monk is charles boyer. i'm not sure what was in david o. selznick's mind in filming this story. someone like ingrid bergman might have made it palatable for the audience. but you can bet that the movie-going public of 1936 when they plunked their money down for a ticket they expected to see marlene as a modern day salome rather than a saint with that title. the public still remembered rudolph valentino and you can bet that it was some desert romance and seduction that they were expecting.  as for the monks you have to remember that they are self supporting in their monasteries and this particular one bottles a special wine of which boyer happens to be the one with the secret. the monastery will have to rethink it's economics if boyer leaves. the monks are a sincerely pious group, but from the head man charles waldron on down they've a right to be a little concerned with some self interest.  anyway a whole lot of religious platitudes get said here by a pair of leads that really are not suited for the parts. most especially marlene dietrich. i would watch this film with an eye for the special color desert cinematography and forget the plot.",0

"i was never a big fan of horror movies. they usually try cheap tricks to scare their audiences like loud noises and creepy children. they usually lack originality and contain overacting galore. the only horror movie i like was stir of echoes with kevin bacon. it was well-acted, and had a great story. but it has been joined and maybe even surpassed by stanley kubrick's the shining, quite possibly the scariest movie ever.  the movie follows a writer (jack nicholson) and his family who agree to watch over a hotel while it is closed for the winter. there were rumors of the place being haunted and the last resident went crazy and murdered his family. but jack is convinced it will be ok and he can use the quiet to overcome his writer's block. after months of solitude and silence however, jack becomes a grumpy and later violent. is it cabin fever or is there something in the hotel that is driving him mad?  one of the creepiest parts about the movie is the feeling of isolation that kubrick makes. the hotel is very silent, and the rooms are huge, yet always empty. it is also eerily calm when jack's son is riding his bike through the barren hallways. jack nicholson's performance is also one of his very best, scaring the hell out of me and making me sure to get out once in awhile. my favorite scene is when he is talking to a ghost from inside a walk-in refrigerator.  the shining is tops for horror movies in my opinion, beating the snot out of crap like the ring and the blair witch project. it may be a oldie, but is definitely a goodie. 8/10",1

"i had seen this film many years ago and it had made a lasting impression on me. alas, i have hardened to many films over the years and did not expect to be impressed by 'kalifornia' upon watching again recently. i am pleased to say that it is every bit as unnerving and watchable as it was ten or so years ago.  there are two things which really give this movie its power. the first is its cast. we have a staggeringly disturbing turn by a young brad pitt as early grace. knowing pitt, as we all do, as one of the most enduring heart-throbs hollywood has ever had, it is refreshing to see him play such a vile, unattractive character. pitt pulls the show off without resorting to white-trash cliché or parody, and manages to remain genuinely terrifying throughout the movie.  juliette lewis is equally impressive as grace's tragic girlfriend, playing the character like a ten year old girl with a forty year old's life experience. lewis manages to evoke pity (for her character's station in life) as well as contempt (for her naivety), but she underpins her performance with the kind of subtlety rarely seen by an actor so young. personally, i think it's a tragedy that neither pitt nor lewis were nominated for any awards for their performances here.  david duchovony and michelle forbes are both perfectly cast as the yuppy couple who unwittingly end up travelling across the us with pitt and lewis. duchovony is aptly geeky and naive, and forbes seems emphatically cynical and shut-off, but both actors manage to convincingly portray their characters' changes as they are equally intrigued, repulsed and strangely attracted to pitt.  the fine casting and uniformly brilliant acting aside, this film really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing. at the time 'kalifornia' was released, hollywood was releasing a slew of nice-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic movies ('single white female', 'pacific heights', 'the hand that rocks the cradle', 'deceived', 'sleeping with the enemy' etc). most of these movies followed the same formula, the only variation being the nature of the relationship between good guy and bad guy. 'kalifornia' doesn't really stray too far from this territory, but its first two acts are the perfect example of the slow-boil thriller, and we are kept on the very edge of our seats waiting for the tide to turn.  when the penny does drop, and pitt is let loose to play the maniacal bad guy, the film shifts gears completely and the last twenty minutes don't quite live up to rest of the movie. that said, the action is thick and fast and the resolution is suitable cold. the fight is over, but the scars will always be there.  much of the narration (provided by a somewhat whiny, pre x-files duchovony) is a tad contrived. of course, it's meant to be from the book the duchovony's journalist character has written, so one could argue that the self-conscious narration is meant to be a nod to the kind of sensationalised style in which most journalists write.  the film is largely a success and is certainly a cut above 90% of the thrillers of the past twenty years. highly recommended, but not for the weak of stomach or mind. this film is disturbing on more than one level. but then, it's meant to be.",1
"having read another review, i thought this movie would actually be good. i do enjoy the ""b"" movies, but this couldn't even be classed as such. the photography is probably the only half-way decent thing in the movie. but the editing left much to be desired. it was very choppy and staccato. whoever chose the music and sound did a terrible job. the music was awful, specially anything atmospheric or scene setting. if the acting had been better, they could have pulled the movie off. unfortunately, i've seen better acting in porn flicks. if you want to see a ""b"" vampire movie, check out 'blood ties'. you'll be much more entertained.",0

"the influence of hal hartley in adrienne shelly's ""i'll take you there"" is not overt, but clearly has ties to his work (shelly has acted in two of hartley's films). not only does her film exhibit a very tight narrative, but the hyper-stylized and extreme characters strangely render human emotion in a very real light. though this film is not ironic on the whole (thank god), the small and subtle ironies that pepper the piece allude to the bitter truths in love and loss. with beautiful cinematography and a soundtrack straight from the seventies, ""i'll see you there"" is a great indie-film that doesn't stoop to postmodern irony when dealing with the woes of love and the reality of human emotion.  the film begins with bill's life falling to pieces. not only has he sold his best friend ray a beautiful country home, but his wife rose has left him in order to join ray in the retreat. all washed up, bill wallows in his own gloom and doom until his sister lucy (played by the director adrienne shelly) brings him all kinds of surprises: a self-help book and a ""date"" for her traumatized brother.  the unwilling bill tries to refuse, but the sudden appearance of bernice at his door leaves him no choice. no doubt bernice's initially superficial demeanor and ridiculous hairstyle detract from his ability to ""rebound"" with her. however, her pseudo-hippie qualities annoy him so much that he lashes at her on their first date. and bernice is so traumatized by his derogatory remarks that she attaches herself to him, forcing herself upon him. to what end, we are not aware... except for maybe the fact that she is psycho. (and who better to play the psycho than ally sheedy?)  aware that bill desperately wants to see rose, bernice offers her car, but on the condition that he take her somewhere first. on the way, she proceeds to hold bill prisoner with his own gun (a pinkerton detective, no less). an imbroglio of angst, resentment, redemption, passion and violence ensue as bill and bernice find themselves on their way to the country home of ray and rose... of course, with a few stops along the way.",1
this could be a 10 if it wasn't for the quite predictable and hollywood-ish scenario. daniel day-lewis confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time (why not the leading may i ask) and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level. i personally was impressed with hugh o' connor who played christy brown as a child. the very first scene i watched him was really strong. wow.,1

"actually, they don't, but they certainly did when trying to think of a singular line that adequately summarises how terrible this entry in the series really is. there were some moments that could have been good, but they are mostly outweighed by their own conversion into missed opportunities, and don't get me started on the bad.  the wasted opportunities are pretty obvious, but i will recap them here in case anyone cares. anyone who hasn't seen the film and genuinely gives a toss would be advised to stop reading at this point. the first, and potentially the biggest, wasted opportunity, was the plot with freddy's long-lost child. now, the extreme mental illness that freddy appears to suffer (and i might hasten to add that less than one percent of mental patients are a threat to other people, leave alone to this extent) is hereditary, so why not a mystery-type slasher in which lisa zane's character dreams of freddy murdering the teens, only we later discover it's actually her doing all the killing? sound like a good plot idea to you? obviously it was above the heads of talalay and de luca.  then there's the trip to springfield, where the entire adolescent population has been wiped out, and the remaining adults are experiencing a kind of mass psychosis. funnily enough, said mass psychosis was actually depicted in a realistic and convincing manner, although this has a fair amount to do with the fact that we are never shown too much. we are just given quick visual hints of the massive loss of connection with reality that would stem from the grief of every youngster in town dying for reasons beyond one's comprehension and control. the essential problem with this plot element, however, is that the town is abandoned too quickly, and with no real answers. this collection of scenes would have been far creepier with ten minutes of say... one sane citizen explaining to these visitors why the springfield fair looks like a horror show.  of course, horror films are never noted for their character development, unless they're the kind of horror films john carpenter used to direct, but how are we supposed to really care when characters we know next to nothing about die? at least wes craven took the time to set up his characters in the original, and used a few cheap tricks to draw the audience in. that, in a nutshell, is probably the biggest problem with freddy's dead: it just doesn't try at all, leave alone hard enough.  on a related note, i feel kind of sorry for robert englund, now that he is more or less inextricably linked with the freddy character. he has played far better characters in far better productions (the science-fiction miniseries ""v"", for example), and to be forever remembered as ""the man who played freddy"" is selling him rather short. it seems he will never break the mold of horror films now. as for the rest of the cast, well, i think their performances here speak for themselves. they deserved to be permanently typecast as little more than b-grade horror props. even yaphet kotto doesn't escape this one unscathed, as his character is one of the most childishly written in the history of b-films.  all in all, freddy's dead gets a 1 out of me. i'd vote lower, but the imdb doesn't allow for that. fd is really a testament to how a writer's inability to exploit a concept to the fullest extent can ruin not only a film, but an entire franchise.",0
"guns blasting, buildings exploding, cars crashing, and that's just the first ten minutes.   this action-packed film involving a rogue ex-cia mercenary who can't seem to die no matter how many times he's shot (hence the title) is pretty decent.   tough and toothy gary busey, usually cast as a villain in these kinda flicks, has his usual crazy charm but is a bit more subdued: after all he's carrying the entire show. which doesn't mean there isn't a lot of terrific supporting roles including william smith, luke askew, mills watson, r.g. armstrong, henry silva, lincoln kirkpatrick, thalmus rasulala, and several other ""forgotten"" character-actors.   there's enough smaller action sequences to hold up the entire story: busey has to free a group of ""kidnapped"" american military elites and return a high-tech ""supertank"" (a normal tank with a cheesy add-on pasted to the top) back to the states.   but does america deserve this killing machine any more than the bad guys? this question is asked, of course, like in any film centering on the cia... but without getting preachy.",1
"my spouse & i found this movie to be very schlocky. it started out good, but quickly got unbelievable & ridiculous. most of the acting was poor, with the exception of the little girl, abbie, who really was terrific. in addition, the dialog was predictable & lame - especially gideon, the angel's. also, without giving away anything, when one of the characters has a tragedy, she almost appears nonchalant. at first we thought it was 'shock', but then we realized that it was just a terrible script. we love almost all of the hallmark movies & their heart-warming stories, but this movie doesn't rise to the occasion of being one. there are so many great ones - don't waste your time with this horrible movie.",0
"as an employee of the swedish air force i enjoyed the nice gripen and hkp 9 (mbb bo 105) flight scenes in this movie. one of the few disappointments was the ews 39 jammer pod, in this case an inert rb 75 (maverick) missile painted black with the letters ""ews 39"" in white along the side. real jammer pods definitely do not look like that, at least not the ones i've seen.  but apart from that, it's an entertaining movie with a very amusing ending (the last minute). anyone interested in seeing various swedish military units, including the now-legendary ssg, on film should see this one.

"this film is a flagrant rip-off of one of the best novels of all time, silas marner by george eliot.  the details of the film shown on imdb do give acknowledgement to the original authoress but i did not see this at the beginning of the film, only a credit at the end of it saying ""suggested by the book silas marner"". suggested? it was nothing but a complete rip- off of all the essential elements of the story:  a wronged and sad old man, an artisan, poor and lonely, has all his money stolen. one night a child wanders up to his door as her mother lies dying in the snow outside. the man takes her in and brings her up until one day the local squire (or rich politician here) demands to adopt the child. it is he who has fathered the child during an illicit affair years before. the battle then ensues as to who should have legal custody of the child.  in this and every other aspect of the film, the story is exactly the same. in only one can i find a difference. silas marner had epilepsy - but perhaps that would have strained the acting abilities of mr martin too far. on top of that he has his hair dyed in some carrot juice concoction (presumably to make him look younger, but actually making him look more the clown that he is)! there is also the addition of meaningless jokes, that this offbeat comedian cannot resist bringing into the story which have no part in it and only detract from the profoundness of the story. like when the child cries in the courthouse declaring she can only be happy with the man who has fathered her all these years. this is conveyed in the film by the girl applying nasal decongestant to the bridge of her nose to make her tearful!  i am surprised that legalities and integrity within the film industry permit such a film to be made. if i was a trustee of george eliot's i would insist on reparation. if i was steve martin i would send the profits to that estate, or to the poor. at the very least it should be entitled silas marner - adapted by s martin. or better still removed from the archives!  if you are interested in this story - and i hope you are - dismiss this completely and watch silas marner. or read the book! the bbc made an excellent adaptation of it in the 1980's.",0
"it's amazing that this movie turns out to be in one of my hitlists after all. it is by far the number 1 worst movie i have ever seen.  not only have i ever been this bored before (luckily not for more then 1,5 hours), the pre-adolescent attempts at humor that feature it are not even close to getting but one of the corners of my mouth slightly tilted. after the first very awkward part, you tend to hope that the other parts will be at least slightly better. you hope in vain, it only goes downhill from there.  the movie has no story worth telling whatsoever and repeats this non-story three times. one can only hope that by some miracle all remaining copies of this movie are lost forever and trent harris never lays his hands on a camera again...",0
"dahmer, a young confused man. dahmer, a confusing movie. granted, i had a few beers while watching the movie, but that doesn't explain why i got so bored by this flick.  its flashbacks are nothing but confusing and annoying, and there's no real storyline with a beginning and an end, the only thing that made sense in the movie was the explaining text in the beginning and at the very end of the movie. the inbetween stuff, which would be the movie, is just boring images and a waste of time.   we never see actual murders, everything is just a bunch of insinuations. sometimes you even just get a feeling that dahmer's dreaming the entire thing, but you know he isn't, since it's  based on a true story and this actually happened, at least most of it. but what happened? it's not easy to tell.  i do not encourage people to waste time on this movie. i  didn't like it one bit and i felt cheated when it suddenly ended.   */*****",0

"quite honestly, the omega code is the worst movie i have seen in a very long time. during the first 30 minutes i sat stunned in my seat, trying to decide if i should demand a refund. but since i hadn't paid to see it in the first place (passes), i figured i might as well stay. and i didn't think it could possibly get any worse.  it did. i will quickly run through the low points (includes some spoilers): the horrible miscasting of casper van dien as gillen lane, a motivational speaker with two phds. the characterization was inconsistent; for example, lane, despite his credentials, is a complete nitwit. then there's the lame-o depiction of the fulfillment of the biblical prophecies; we see a bunch of sensational news soundbites accompanied by ridiculous computer print outs of the translated biblical code. also, terrible ""action"" sequences: lane escapes from tough situations without explanation, and the one time lane actually does seem to be in danger, it turns out to be a dream sequence! that's cute for grammar school writing assignments, but it's an inexcusable plot device in a motion picture. the pacing was bad: after a long opener, the first third of the movie changes scenes every 90 seconds. later, the pacing improves, but there is still far too much unnecessary jumping around. and as someone else mentioned, years pass yet no one (not even lane's young daughter) ages. that was disconcerting.  there are a few good things, though. the quality of the film (e.g. lack of graininess) is high and very attractive. the outdoor shots were well done and the location shooting added a touch of realism. also, there are a few moments in the last part of the film when lane calls on god (finally) to help him - this proved to be quite exhilarating - even to me, someone who does not accept jesus as a personal savior. but i liked this because it struck me as being the only genuine scene in the movie. unfortunately, it was followed by major incomprehensibility.  the characters, dialogue, direction and acting were all poorly done. michael ironside had nothing to do, and michael york was just weird. i think the producers wanted to do too much; if the plot had been tighter and more focused, and the characterization more fleshed out, the film would have been far better.   in a nutshell, the omega code disappoints. definitely do not pay to see this. i give it ** out of ten stars.

"don't listen to the misleading title ""werewolf woman"". the europeans are well known for putting an emphasis on sex and nudity over actual scares in their horror films, but this one here is just a bit too much. ""werewolf woman"" seems to have a sleazy sex scene copped off with the title character going crazy and brutally killing her partner. fun the first few times, but a hundred minutes of this becomes very monotonous quickly. shes not even a werewolf, but a schizo chick whose ancestor was hanged for lycanthropy. the film can't even decide its tone, with the first ten minutes (a flashback) being legitimate supernatural horror (i thought i was in for a trash classic after these) to a rather poor character study of the female being repeatedly abused and tortured to a revenge thriller. at the end, the director insists this is based on a true story. yeah, all right.  to be fair, there are a few entertaining aspects of the production. the title werewolf woman is a looker and there are a few nice gore effects and nude scenes. however, these become rather monotonous quickly. also, the dubbed dialog is pretty hilarious in a camp fashion, especially the worlds most swinging doctor (he drinks on the job). unfortunately, the film becomes pretty irritating fast. there's no actual plot or anything else really. its a shame, because reading a description i felt the film had some real potential. ""werewolf woman"" is far overlong, slow moving, and a bit too pointless, even by the standards of the exploitation genre. (4/10)",0

"firstly, this is a very dated film, non-focused in its exposition of the left wing political revolution. honestly, when someone says that the only way to be truly revolutionary is to cease to be intellectual ( which in itself is quite nonsensical, since the answer was arrived at by precisely being intellectual) it reduces me to despair; as if we all should return to being apes in the name of equality - it is simply ridiculous. our intellectuality is only one of many human qualities, but this does not mean we should not educate ourselves to the highest possible degree. but no doubt this non-educational message ties in with godard's use of rock music; hence the rolling stones.  the song 'sympathy for the devil', whose creation we witness, and from which the film takes its name, is in fact nothing special. the chord sequence, which is not especially original, was used to much better effect in led zeppelin's 'thankyou'(led zeppelin ii). apart form that, 'sir' mick jagger declaims in his usually nebulous manner (rather like bob dylan)- notice how the first melodic phrase is unimaginatively repeated over again to form the verse.  besides the fact that the black panthers depicted in this film, don't seem to know what they are fighting for, the most interesting scenes involve the equation of fascism with pornography; a message that in fact undermines the sexual 'liberation' of the 1960s and today ( indeed, a message that would belie the behaviour of the rolling stones around the time the film was made).  no wonder, the dvd came free with the sunday times! for a truly profound historical exposition of left-wing sympathy, listen to luigi nono's masterpiece, 'al gran sole carico'd'amore'.",0
"this movie is about sexual obsession. bette davis plays mildred. this is a woman who men are drawn to. not because she is a nice beautiful girl but because she is a sexual entity. now the movie does not come out and say that but it is obvious. there is a scene in the movie in which men are all going googly eyes over her. she works as a waitress in a coffee shop, she can't read and she not really anybody to look at but she is a flirt. it is obvious the male customers in that coffee shop are there because of her. one day phillip a club footed failed painter medical student comes in the shop to say a good word for his friend but he becomes besotted the moment he sees her. he starts buying her things even pays for her apartment. meanwhile she is seeing other people and she makes no secrets of it. he dreams about her like she is a angel, but she is no angel. he is constantly thinking about her. his med school grades are even failing. so what the nookie is too good. he wants to marry her but she rejects him because she is marrying another guy. she always lets phil know she really doesn't have love feelings for him all of time. he is heart broken but he meets another woman. they seem fine but it is obvious he is still dreaming of the bimbo. mildred does comes back with a baby and unwed. phillip takes her in again, but she starts going out with a friend of his, the light bulb comes on a little and he kicks her out. she does what she knows works so she tries to seduce him, well it doesn't work and she proceeds to burn his tuition money up. oh we have a club foot that he has problems about, even though a street teenager who has the same problem tells him to lighten up about it. he meets another girl named sally we have a march of time montage which shows her aging while he strings her along still waiting for mildred. well he has no school tuition, can't find a job. finally sally and her dad takes him in. not before another march of time montage showing him going downhill. soon his uncle who raised him dies and he gets money to become a doctor. meanwhile he finds mildred needs him again. she has tb. meanwhile he is still leading sally down the primrose path about marriage and he takes a job on a steamship. finally the bimbo dies and phillip declares he is free now and he will marry sally. i wished she told him to stuff it. now i know my take on the characters are not going to get me any points. but i feel phillip was the bad guy. yes mildred is a strumpet but he knows it, and he keeps coming back. mean while he has two other girlfriends who love him but he treats as appetizers. i guess the sex wasn't as good. but in any case he dogs those women waiting for mildred. not only that but the man who gets mildred pregnant is already married and when philip asks him what he intends to do about baby ( apparently the baby's name) he laughs is off, he has no intention in supporting her and baby and he is wealthy. sally's father who has 9 children say some pretty nasty things about women but he is said to be a old traditionalist. philip doesn't seem to refute his feelings either. men are using mildred as a boy toy but the men in this movie come out as unscathed. yes she was not a respectable woman but far from a villain. to me it is philip who was had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for mildred.",1
"this movie lost me with the crossbow rpg (rocket-propelled grenade). it was like someone cut and pasted a scene from robocop. i half expected beowulf to say exclaim, ""i like it!""  i watched this because i like chris bruno from ""the dead zone"" tv show and he did his part. he chose a strange accent, but at least he kept it consistent for the whole movie -- unlike any of his costars. they kept slipping into all kinds of speech from old english to modern english, sometimes in the same sentence.  there are already many comments on how this movie is different from the source material. however, even on its own, this movie's plot is not good. it's just boring, which even the low budget doesn't excuse. having a low budget means that you need to at least have a good story, dialog and decent acting. those things don't cost much. instead, they spent their money on half-assed cgi and some decent costumes and sets.  life is too short to watch this movie.",0
"sydney lumet hasn't had a box office hit in 20 years and yet at 83 has managed to churn out a tight, well-cast, suspenseful thriller set in his old stamping ground, new york city. (how he got insurance, let alone the budget after all those flops, is a mystery also). the story is a pretty grim one and the characters are not particularly likable but it held me on the edge of my seat till the final scene.  two brothers with pressing financial problems conspire to rob a suburban jewelry store owned by their elderly parents. the only victim is going to be the insurance company. the robbery goes awry and two people die. most of the film is concerned with the aftermath. the action is non-linear and seen from the main character's differing points of view, but it is not difficult to follow. what is not so easy to work out is the back story  how did the brothers get into such a mess? there are clues  the younger brother being the baby of the family is his fathers' favorite while the older brother seems to be carrying a lot of baggage about his relationship with his father, and vice versa, but that hardly accounts for him becoming a heroin-using murdering embezzler.  as the scheming older brother, a corpulent philip seymour hoffman dominates the film, but he is well supported by ethan hawke as his bullied, inadequate younger brother. albert finney as their father seems to be in a constant state of rage but then the script calls for that. marisa tomei as the older brother's cheating wife at the age of 42 puts in the sexiest performance i've seen in many a year. the film literally starts with a bang, but we are out of that comfort zone pretty quickly.  i don't know the origins of this story by first time scriptwriter kelly masterton but i suspect that like lumet's great 70's film ""dog day afternoon"" it is based on fact  it's too silly to be untrue. lumet is just about the last of those immensely versatile old-time craftsman studio directors who with immense speed were able to direct just about anything that was put in front of them. some great films were produced that way as well as some classic turkeys. this isn't a classic of either sort  it's a well-crafted piece of downbeat entertainment. it will probably leave you feeling that you were lucky not be a member of a family as dysfunctional as this one, but still wondering as to how they got that way. we do know the parents were happy but we see so little of the mother and hear so little about her it is impossible pick up on her relationship with the boys. (there is also a daughter whose presence seems redundant). well, like tolstoy, we have to conclude that ""each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way"".",1
"if you have any sort of appreciation for character and dialogue, and any sense of american cultural history, you will find a lot of very absorbing material in this film. it probably was originally a play, and that's why it's dialogue heavy, but i can't stress enough how these icons that we only have a shallow understand of are made into truly complex and wonderful characters.  this film is better than any college course for telling you how to create a character-driven story.

"this movie is essentially shot on a hand held camera by the actors in it. in some ways a mockumentary in other ways a video diary from killers it is full on account of a ""columbine"" style attack. while this movie does not answer all the big questions, it does give you an insight into how easy it would be to get away with. through the movie you are shown how the actors illegally shortened shot guns, made pipe bombs and came up with an action plan for ""zero day"". the actors (if you can call them that) were brilliant, they obviously borrowed heavily from there own lives, but at no stage did i detect them really acting (something tom cruise should try). the use of the cctv and the 911 operator at the end was genius, but i'm not sure if we needed the very last scene. overall though a really good movie on a very tough topic.",1
"this italian semi-horror movie starts out very much like a soft core porn movie and turns into a mystery that has a few to many loose ends to be good, that and the fact it is rather dull just makes this film rather unwatchable for my tastes. the only thing really worth watching are the many boobs spread throughout the film. the story has a guy who at the beginning of the movie luring girls to his castle where he proceeds to take them to his dungeon, go berserk and seemingly kill them. they show the nudity, but they never really show the murders at this point in the film. then the guy finds a nice red head at a party and proceeds to make out with her and marry her. he has a thing for red heads you see as his beloved former wife evelyn was also one, she also died under circumstances that must have not been the viewing audience's business. after a lot of talky scenes murders start to take place involving snakes, foxes and such. at this point it is easy enough to figure out who is responsible for the murders and what the motive is then you have a nonsensical ending where everything wraps up not so nicely. this movie just did not work for me, it left me with to many questions and the last third of the film just did not have the boobs of the first two thirds of the film. explaining evelyn's death would have helped the film as would have some sort of ending where evelyn did rise from the grave. granted the title is not totally misleading as she did sort of leave the grave, just not under her own power. the gore is very light for the most part as there is a scene with the foxes and a scene at the end with quite a bit of blood too. i just thought for the most part this movie was a tad dull.",0
opening the film with a bach toccata is an aural hint of what is to unfold in this intense drama. all the compositional devices bach perfected to keep his listener (and the performer) intrigued and entertained applies to this film. there isn't a mutual tenderness between the two lead characters and the lead female in the final scene i feel is justified in stating she was raped even though her victimizer feels she was forewarned that he was a cad. mamet compellingly explores the emotional chasm and differences between the genders but i feel he is clueless about how they actually compliment one another given a healthy sense of humor. if mamet ever developed a healthy humorous take on the interaction between the genders i wonder how this work would have ended? as it exists it is very somber and mean spirited.,1
"i saw this movie when it was new. later i rented it in japan after having been here three years, afraid that i would cringe when i viewed it in the harsh light of my expanded international experience. the movie pleasantly surprised me with how accurately it portrays the culture clash between japan and pennsylvania (where i'm from). not all the stuff is factually spot on, but the tone is perfect.  i'm still in japan many years later, and i continue to enjoy this film for its even-handed treatment of the two sides in the story. interestingly, although the japanese-american actors spoke japanese in the original, the dialog is redubbed in the japan version to cover up obvious second-language delivery problems.  i noticed one reviewer uses this in a japanese class. i think you can learn more about what to expect from an encounter with japan by watching this film than by reading any of the ""serious"" books on the matter (most of which were written in the 80s and financed by propagandizing japanese companies).  don't be fooled by drag on the average rating caused by one-star reviewers who, among other things, found it implausible that the japanese would want to build cars in the us. (of course, the japanese operate many factories there to be close to the customers and to avoid trade friction.) this is a very warm and funny movie that i would rate higher were it not for a few 80s clichés, like the dancing around to cheesy electronic disco music. michael keaton has never been funnier.",1
"not as bad, as it's credited to being (hooper's done far worse) more so disappointing for me. such an imaginative concept, which is never really tapped in to by hooper with his economical direction and even less so in the smoky (excuse the pun) writing. it goes so sinister and over-the-top in a dead serious tone, becoming ridiculous and unfocused letting the whole pessimistic mystery / conspiracy-laced narrative being easily telegraphed to end on something completely abrupt. because of that, the pacing goes on to be rather sluggish and brad dourif (cool to see him in a leading role) seems to struggle with an off-balanced performance, despite etching out a bemusedly quirky intensity to his off-colour character. even though it's cheaply done, there's a competent technical attitude to it. however it doesn't seem to go anywhere out of the ordinary with its idea and wants to plaster in nasty jolts (which some do work) and strikingly steaming special effects (flames, flames everywhere) instead. hooper does display some stylishly frenetic imagery (more so towards the latter end), and the camera-work is swiftly manoeuvred and the beaming score is titillating. the performances are bit all over the shop with the appearances of william prince, cynthia bain, dey young, jon cypher and melinda dillon. also geroge buck flower and john landis have small, but amusing cameos especially landis. nothing surprises, but it's passably engaging.",0
"the best thing you can say about this movie is that if you are a fan of sonny chiba, this movie gives you lots of him. chiba makes speeches; chiba poses; chiba sneers; chiba glares at the camera; chiba punches and kicks the living sushi out of a whole bunch of bad guys; chiba sits around on couches and chairs and looks thoughtful/pensive; chiba drives his car...  i enjoy chiba as an actor and a martial artist...but even for a chiba fan, this movie may have a little too much sonny chiba. it's obviously something of a vanity vehicle for him. and no, i wouldn't put ""street fighter"" in the same category, because in ""sf"" he plays a ruthless, amoral anti-hero and he shares the camera with an intriguing cast of friends and foes. here, he's front and center almost all the time, and he tries to be batman, captain america and bruce lee rolled into one. toshiro mifune and chow yun fat couldn't pull this off for the length of an entire feature film, and sonny just kind of wears out his welcome. at least he could have changed out of his suit once in a while.  the movie is further messed up by an entirely gratuitous and badly done introductory sequence (apparently tacked on to the front of the film for the american version) and a goofy cheer ""(""viva!! chiba!! viva!! chiba!!) that starts things on the wrong foot. there is some astoundingly amateurish and inappropriate dubbing - sonny (or his usual english stand-in) apparently couldn't be bothered to do the vocals for the american version, so they got some poor dope with an entirely different and smoother voice and dialect that is quite jarring coming from the face we all know and love from ""street fighter"".   even with all those flaws and the overexposure, this could still be a minor classic, but the camera work and the fight scenes are hopelessly cheesy. i'm willing to believe that karate actually works if someone as amazing as chiba's character is supposed to be does it, but the director and cameraman hedged their bets by chopping and editing fight scenes with a weed whacker so you can't really see what's going on most of the time. it's not all bad: there are some decent shots and compositions, and there's at least one memorable and nightmarish moment when the bad guys appear in the client's bedroom in a genuinely inventive way.   and as for the actual plot...forget it. for a ""bodyguard"", chiba's character is something of an idiot. the screenplay depends on his making mistakes and oversights that repeatedly place him (and his ""client"") in perilous situations so he can fight his way out of them, and after 30 minutes, it strains even the most credulous judgment to think that this guy is supposed to be any good. (also, if his character was really out to destroy the japanese drug trade, he'd have taken his client by her neck 10 minutes into the screenplay and shaken her until her teeth chattered like a castanet until she spilled her little secrets...and a whole lot of pointless death and conflict would have been avoided.)   still, as a whole this movie is a long way from the bottom of the barrel. it's still sonny chiba, and he's still fun to watch. i paid a buck to get this off the bargain dvd rack at a local mega mart, and i feel it was worth watching once.",0
"this film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of sex in the city and four weddings and a funeral. in fact, if they'd called it sex at a funeral, they might have done better at the box office.  but the film falls between two stools and can't get up. the characters spout improbably bright dialog, but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human. one arbitrary, senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot, and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprise.  andie macdowell gets points for acting her little heart out, but the performing honors are stolen by imelda staunton, as of all things, a police detective (don't they have a height requirement over there?). ms. staunton seems unable to make a false move. would that we could say the same about the writer-director.  if notting hill annoyed you as being bogus, stay away from this one. phonus bolognus on the half-shell.",0

""la maman et la putain"" has surely passed into history as an influence on much of what's been done in france and elsewhere in the past thirty years and no one interested in the history of film, certainly, should be dissuaded from watching it. to express a purely subjective judgement, however, i feel compelled to disagree with almost every other review posted here and say to people: ""don't watch it; it's a waste of hours of your time that will just leave you feeling rather sick and angry."" and by that i don't mean ""sick and angry"" about ""the human condition"" or anything so general and profound as that, because that is exactly the line that most critics have adopted in their fulsome praise of the film - ""an ordeal to watch in its ruthless dissection of our emotional cowardice and cruelty"" and so on - and, if it really managed to put across a universally or even broadly relevant message of this sort, then the director would have good reason to be satisfied with himself, however pessimistic his conclusions may be. my beef with the film is rather that i don't see this hours-long record of empty vanity and petty treachery as being justified or excused by any generally relevant message at all. all three main characters are deeply morally unattractive individuals: alexandre to the greatest degree, of course, because we see by far the most of him and because he seldom shuts up for more than thirty seconds; marie perhaps to the least degree, because we see the least of her. alexandre's affected and pretentious monologues have a kind of amusement value, of course, but the amusement wears thin as one comes more and more clearly to realize that jean-pierre léaud is most likely not even acting and that, with absurd remarks like ""un homme beau comme un film de nicholas ray"", he really was just reproducing word-for-word opinions that were accepted as authentic and profound by the milieu in which he, along with the director eustache, had been living for about ten years by the time of the making of the film. i suppose if the tone of relentless superficiality and triviality had been sustained throughout 100% of the film, it might have worked as a long sardonic comedy about a particularly shallow, worthless and despicable post-'68 milieu. what made, however, this viewer at least extremely angry with the director was his granting of at least one lengthy scene each to alexandre and veronika in which we are clearly expected to empathize with and feel for them as if they shared a moral universe with us. if a man can get away with living in the flat of and professing to love one woman, sleeping (mostly in this very flat) with another, and running around paris proposing marriage to yet a third, well, i suppose i can wish him the best of luck in the dog-eat-dog world he's chosen to create for himself. what i can't, however, in all conscience do is listen even for a moment to maudlin monologues from him in which he speaks about his ""anxiety"" and his ""despair"". the same goes double for the even more despicable veronika, whom we are shown barging drunk into the apartment and even the bed shared by marie and alexandre and behaving there with an infantile inconsistency tantamount to the most savage and heartless cruelty. as i say, if ""la maman et la putain"" is intended to be nothing more nor other than a portrait of alexandre, veronika and marie, three individuals whom any even halfway decent person would never admit into their company let alone their home, then i suppose there is a kind of legitimacy in praising the director for being ""unflinching"" (though why one should even feel like ""flinching"" once one had consciously opted to create such thoroughly repellent characters to filmically observe i can't imagine). the problem, however, is that the director is clearly convinced - and appears to have succeeded in convincing generations of critics - that alexander, veronika and marie are somehow representative of human beings in general and of the limits of human beings' emotional capabilities. this latter idea, however, is arrant and offensive nonsense. there may indeed be an inherent fallibility and tendency to tragedy in human relations in general and sexual relations in particular. but the nature and degree of this fallibility and tendency to tragedy can only possibly be determined by people who make a sincere and serious effort to make such relations work. it surely needs no cinematic or authorial genius to convey to us the information that a man who behaves like alexandre is going to end up hated, miserable, and alone, or that women who insist on expecting love from a man like alexandre are going to end up disappointed and bitter. watch ""la maman et la putain"" if you're historically interested in what passed for culture and human interaction in a certain post-'68 parisian milieu which was probably, unfortunately, not restricted to just a few particularly anti-social types like these. but please don't make the mistake of believing that what is recorded here has any general relevance for humanity in the way that a film by jean renoir or martin scorsese might be argued to have.",0
"another outstanding foreign film which thoroughly trounces the never-ending crop of crud emanating from hollywood! this is a story of life and living. no, definitely not the perfect little life so often depicted in the totally artificial hollywood movies but rather, the real life complete with real characters each with strengths and weaknesses just like real people in our lives and ourselves.  the dynamics of all of these lives, intertwined within the walls of this bathhouse, and particularly its aged owner, are magnificent, heart touching and highly thought provoking.  sit back, relax, and be carried away into the simple and beautiful life. there is real wisdom to be learned in this movie if you only open yourself up to it.  you will not be disappointed.",1
"this is a very bad movie. i laughed once or twice, and the storyline sucks! there is maybe one funny joke, it is stupid and it is boring. through the whole short movie, i was falling asleep and wondering when it was going to end.  no one acts human, and everyone acts stupid and ridiculous. rob schneider acting like an animal isn't something i would pay to see. it looked funny, but the bottom line: don't waste you're precious time on such a ridiculous and stupid movie.  i was wondering when it was going to end, even though it is a short movie. in the beginning we thought it would get better; but it gets worse. stupid, all the way to the end. i walked out of the theater, and i would remember that movie as extremely bad forever.  the writer and co-producer of this film is a simpsons tv writer, but this is nothing like the simpsons (this movie sucks!!!)",0
"moon child was one of the more symbolic movies i've seen. what i really liked about it was the illustration on immorality/mortality,and the obstacles and guidances through life. the movie depicts a great deal of vampire kei having the power of immorality and the advantages to it. whether if it is having supernatural abilities or everlasting life, these are what humans usually wish for. moon child shows the pain and disadvantages of being immortal, since the feelings towards loss impacts almost all the characters especially to the main characters sho and kei. the meaning of the title 'moon child' reveals as the film comes close to the end where it clearly shows that everyone is a moon which shines other people's way, giving guidance. i personality quite like that moral the movie depicted on. the weaknesses of the film lies in some parts of the acting and special effects since it made the film less authentic. the scene where character toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions in the acting were put into it. some scenes with special effects like the gun shots also could have been more authentic without making it seem too much like an action video game. the sparks that came out of the guns appeared too fake and i think that could have been eliminated or fixed. nevertheless, i think moon child should be a movie everyone should consider watching. the symbolic ideas and images the movie brings out would be easily accepted by everyone and may interest many viewers. it is quite a thoughtful film and also entertaining to watch.",1

"i found this film to be an utter dissapointment. the talent available to the director- notably stanley tucci, chris walken, hank azaria and alan arkin (without even mentioning the four main leads)- have been completely wasted on an unfunny, mediocre story, whose conclusion one couldn't really care about once introduced to the dire, stereo-typed characters. julia roberts is feeble, zeta-jones is just plain annoying (appearing to reprise her role from high fidelity, minus the humour), crystal just plays his same old hyper-active, neurotic, annoying alter-ego and cusack simply walks through his part, apparently bored with the whole project.  for what is supposed to be a 'romantic comedy', there is absolutely no romance between the central characters, let alone chemistry, and as for the comedy- (possible spoilers)well, the only moments of mild humour came off the back of cusack's role in grosse pointe and his relationship with alan arkin- the scriptwriter obviously unable to show any originality whatsoever. (spoilers) azaria was reasonably amusing as the mexican lover and walken did quite an amusing turn as a parody of an arthouse-maverick-dogme type director- but these parts constituted very little screen time and instead (spoilers) we were treated to billy crystal having his groin sniffed by a dog. pure genius.  for a huge fan of the majority of john cusack's work, not to mention the rest of the fantastic cast, i was completely let down by a film with plenty of good ideas, and at the same time completely unwilling to explore or elaborate on any of them, instead resorting to the same old genre cliches and even lowering itself to the depths of almost 'gross-out, teen-movie' humour at times.  a very poor 4/10.",0
"rupert friend gives a performance, as prince albert, that lifts ""the young victoria"" to unexpected levels. he is superb. as we know, queen victoria fell into a dark, deep depression after prince albert's death and looking into ruper friend's eyes i understood. the film doesn't take us to his death but to an incident that may very well could have cost his life. an act of love. i believed it, or i should say, him. i believed what he felt was real. nothing or anybody gets anywhere near the delicacy and profundity of friend's characterization. emily blunt is good but i didn't believe for a minute she was victoria. no real sense of period. it may no have been her fault but her prince deserved the crown.",1
"viggo mortensen stars as a new inmate of a haunted prison in which the warden (played well by lane smith) has a grisly secret that could be the reason why various prison guards and inmates are being slaughtered by a supernatural presence. lincoln kilpatrick is the lifer who knows the secret and is scared for his life. when i think prison movies, i always think action movies starring stallone or van damme or high caliber dramas such as shawshank redemption or the green mile. however i didn't expect a ghost story more along the lines of exorcist iii. prison however is an atmospheric effort and it certainly remains the best movie of renny harlin's career. the movie is creepy and has some good acting from a cast of (at the time) unknowns. lane smith comes off the best because his warden isn't the usual cliché of evil personified but rather nervous and twitchy which adds some credibility to a movie that far exceeds expectations.  *** out of 4-(good)",1
"while i totally disagree with one reviewer who described charley chase as unfunny, in this film he certainly is. it's a shame, as i suspect the other reviewer must have only seen a few charley chase duds and assumed the guy wasn't funny. films like mighty like a moose and what price goofy? are very good chase films, so he could be really funny given good material. unfortunately, in this film he's given absolutely nothing. even the inclusion of the usually good oliver hardy as a foil isn't any help because the basic premise (boy wants to marry girl but girl's father thinks the boy is a wuss) and the gags are so poor. it's a shame, as i really wanted to love this film but couldn't.  by the way, for those used to the look for charley from the mid-1920s on, you'll be pretty surprised as chase sports no glasses or mustache--and looks very little like you'd expect.",0

"in a famous essay he wrote about charles dickens, george orwell points out that many readers always regretted that dickens never continued writing like he did in pickwick papers: that is, he did not stick to writing funny episodic novels for the rest of his career. this would not have been too difficult for dickens. his contemporary robert surtees did precisely that, only concentrating on the misadventures of the fox hunting set (mr. fancy romford's hounds is a title of one of his novels). among hunters and horse lovers surtees still has a following but most people find his novels unreadable. dickens was determined to show he was more than a funny man (and don't forget, his first book, sketches by boz, was also a funny book). so dickens third book is oliver twist (which got pretty grim at points). orwell says that for any author to grow they have to change the style of their books. dickens would definitely (and successfully) have agreed to that.  but orwell overlooked the genre writer who transcends his fellows. surtees, as i said, is a genre writer concentrating on hunting - but not everyone is interested in hunting. but p.g.wodehouse saw himself as an entertainer, poking fun at the upper reaches of the british social system. his earl of emsworth is prouder of raising the finest pig in england than being...well earl of emsworth! his psmith is always prepared to counterattack when he is supposed to be submissive to an unfair superior. his stanley uckridge will always have a ""perfect"" scheme that should net a huge profit (but always manages to come apart at the end). and best of all, his jeeves will always put his brilliant brain to work rescuing the inept bertie wooster, his boss. since wodehouse had a limited view of his mission as a writer - he was there to do cartoon figures of fun for the entertainment of the world - his books never lost their glow. they served (and still serve) their purposes. in fact, compared wodehouse with his far more serious contemporary evelyn waugh, who also wrote funny books, but of a more intellectual type. the best of waugh remains among the high points of 20th century british literature: brideshead revisited, decline and fall, and the rest. but in his determination to make his points, if his points failed to interest the reader the book frequently collapsed. for every vile bodies there was some failure late in his career like the ordeal of gilbert pinfold. while wodehouse could do lesser hack work too, his falling did not go as far as waugh's did.  wodehouse also was a gifted lyricist (when you hear ""bill"" in the score of showboat, it is not kern and hammerstein's tune, but kern and wodehouse's tune transposed from ""oh lady, lady"" a dozen years earlier). he was a handy dramatist too. so it is pleasing to see that he took his novel a damsel in distress and turned it into the screenplay here.  it has the normal wodehouse touches. that perfect butler keggs (reginald gardiner in a wonderful performance) is a scoundrel in rigging a ""friendly"" gambling game of chance among the staff of the stately home he heads. he is also unable to refrain, occasionally, from singing italian opera - despite constance collier's attempts to control his impulse. this is typical wodehouse characterization. so is the way the love affair between lady alyce and jerry keeps going well and going down due to the antics of keggs and young albert, both of whom want to win that game of chance pot of cash. wodehouse always does that type of plot switch, with antagonists switching their point of view depending on their present state of interest.  wodehouse was also lucky here to have burns and allan to work with. it is generally considered that of all the films they made as supporting actors together (such as six of a kind and we're not dressing) george and gracie did their best support with fred astaire. the fun house sequence, which includes the song ""stiff upper lip"", is wonderful, as is an earlier sequence where the three do a ""whisk broom"" dance (that astaire learned from burns). but gracie's marvelous illogical logic is used by wodehouse in scenes with gardiner (see how she manages to confuse him into giving her more money than her change deserves to be - only albert happens to notice keggs/gardiner's mistake, and looks at gardiner as though he's either stupid or mad). her dialog with lady caroline (collier)'s son reggie (ray noble, the british band leader)leading him to imagine that he will marry her, but saying goodbye to gracie as she drives off with george to get married is wonderful too.  the film supposedly failed at the box office because of the lack of ginger rogers in it, and the weakness of joan fontaine. fontaine is not doing a remarkable job in the role, but the flaw is really wodehouse's - he didn't make the character very interesting. but the film can stand without that, given the other performers and their characters, gershwin's music, and wodehouse's marvelous sense of fun.",1
"i fell asleep on my couch at 7:35pm last night watching larry sanders (i usually directivo it, but not last night). woke up at 3am (invesment banker on the west coast), and was fascinated to see this on hbo2. i was shocked on how poor this 'movie' was. seriously. shocked. so shocked that i had to write a commentary on imdb. this is really really bad. the writing is boring, but the directing and editing are simply below those of a freshman at a film school.  yes it is shot video. mind you, that is shot on video, not digital video. it does look like a soap opera. the clips from skateboard videos have a more 'film' feel to them then this horror.  i wanted to describe the poor directing but i honestly cant remember anything. the shots and blocking are stupid. yes, i chose the word 'stupid'. not unconventional, not daring, not bold, not boring, just stupid. i know people reviewing this review will say ""well give me an example"". i cant. it was 3am. but trust me, i know you will watch it anyway, you will be drawn by the horrible reviews.

"usually, i don't think hollywood productions are fit to be called film, so i call them 'movies' instead. but this piece of elephant manure, is not even fit to be called a movie, hence the quotes in the title.  where shall i start? 1. if this isn't the start of geriatric casting, it sure is the epitome of it. stefanie powers is supposed to play someone even less than half her age, she's supposed to play an 18 year old, and she is forty effing two!!!!   2. a horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of paris and france, where we see cliché characters such as: the sympathetic grumpy shop owner, the bitchy queen of models, the fairy god mother ex-queen of models, etc. this film is surpassed only in this respect by the da vinci code, (which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy).   3. it's highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place, especially if the whole focus is about that  4. the horrible accents!!!   5. the nana mouskouri elevator-music!!!  i could go on, but i think this is enough. and i was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour, while surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations ... i mean ...!!!!!  i invite everyone to add to my list. :) :p :d",0

"not having seen the film in the original theater release, i was happily surprised when the dvd arrived, since this film did not have the wide distribution it merited.  denzel washington directorial debut and the finished product have nothing to envy other films about the same theme by more accomplished directors. the film has a very professional look. it shows that mr. washington has learned a lot being on the other side of the camera. he brings a different angle to this film.  one of the best things the film has is, without a doubt, the fine performance by derek luke. he is an actor who, with the right guidance, will go far, no doubt. his take on the troubled young man, at this point of his life, in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life, up to now, has dealt him, is very true. his antwone is a fine portrait of a man in pain who is basically very good and has so much to give, but no one seems to see that side of his character.  at the worst time of his despair, antwone is sent to dr. davenport, played by mr. washington, in a very sober, if somehow subdued manner. because of the angst within antwone, he misses the opportunity of opening himself to this man, who wants to help, but because of the constrains placed on his office, just have three sessions and then has to dismiss his patient.  things work out, as antwone is able to convince the doctor to keep on working with him. antwone's past is revealed in detail. the abuse he suffers at the hands of mrs. tate, his foster mother, is brutal, to say the least. the attempt at the hand of an older woman in the tate's household of a sexual molestation, gives antwone a bitter taste that stays with him throughout his adult life, as he has been scarred by the shame he carries with him.  antwone finds love at last with cheryl, who is patient enough to make him see a different world by the love she and support she gives him.  the lead performances are very good indeed. denzel washington's dr. davenport has his own problems too. he is not a happy camper either. he can help antwone, but he cannot help himself, or his relationship with an adoring wife.   the talent in the film is incredible. joy bryant makes a fine cheryl. novella nelson, who is a fine actress is superb as mrs. tate, the abusing foster mother.  the reunion of antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sugary and sentimental, but of course, if one is to believe that fisher finds happiness at last, one has to accept that part of the film as well.",1
"well ok, i watched this movie a little over 2 years ago and now i pulled it out of the dusty shelf to watch it again and i must say, i actually think this movie is good. this movie caught a buzz as the bootleg i know what you did last summer 3, much like final stab was to scream 4, and well this movie isn't that bad. i mean it had flaws and of course it would be laughable to release this in the theaters but still for a midnight popcorn flick, this movie is not half bad. it has some scares, and some really hot women i might add. plus it shows off joey lawrence's new beefy look though obviously even that hasn't won him any big hollywood roles either......i feel bad for the man, he had such a career in the early and mid 90's with blossom, some disney movies and the everlasting lawrence brothers show.....joey lawrence was a bit player in the sitcom scene, but then like in a 360 degree turn, his career went south only doing low budget movies like this one.  the movie also throws you off guard in, it makes you think between the crew, there really is a secret that someone knows, to only be disappointed in the end to find out the secret. it also throws you off on who the killer is, i had an idea but still woulnd't think the killer was who he was, but his motives combined with the secret was a huge letdown. now, had there been a secret that was let out? this movie could've been one of the better b rated movies. but also i am a sucker for college themes and i also in college went on spring break in a mansion sized beach house similar to the one in here so it just made me feel sentimental about this movie.  a so-so slasher flick. good for a midnight movie.",0

"i rented this movie, thinking it looked like a wonderfully delightful historical piece. what i got was a piece of pure garbage. this movie was confusing in most spots, choppy in almost every spot and dreadful in all spots. mira sorvino's portrayal of a queen playing a young male scholar was depressing at best. ben kingsley should have been stripped of his knighthood for even considering this film as one of his projects. fiona shaw should definitely stick to playing petunia dursley; at least the harry potter movies are more entertaining than this thing they call a play within a movie.  the cinematography looks like some college kid took a class in cinematography 101 and failed miserably. almost every scene in the movie is chopped up for some sort of effect; the end result of course being the cheesiest bit of editing i've ever seen. jay rodan was almost good as agis; too bad he had such a bad script to work with. rachael stirling gives her best effort as the almost gullible lady in waiting. in the end, i really wish blockbuster video gave refunds. i'm so glad i didn't spend 10 bucks watching this fiasco in the theater. if they've been performing this marivaux play since the 18th century, it makes me wonder how many people over the ages have had their best naps during this work. if i had been there, they wouldn't have hear the play over the snoring. thank goodness for the modern convenience of dvd players; you can skip past the boring or awful scenes. guess that means i only watched the beginning and the end!",0

"this movie makes me want to throw up every time i see it. if you take the first movie, and reverse the plot (ariel wants to leave the sea, her daughter wants to go to the sea), take the same characters and give them new animals and new names, and then throw in crappy animation and the biggest suck factor, possible, you get the little mermaid 2. its basically a copy of the first movie with a reversed plot. i'll take you through the horror of it step by step. these are the people from the 1st movie: first of all, prince eric is still prince eric, with about 3 lines in the whole movie. ariel is uptight, annoying, and is not the carefree, headstrong spirit we saw in the 1st. in fact, she is the exact opposite. sebastian is still sebastian only less cute, less convincing as being stressed out, and the jokes just aren't funny anymore. flounder has about 2 lines. he now has kids and he talks with a dumb nasal voice. scuttle is still dumb scuttle only not funny. king triton's character is probably the best, he still retains the intimidation and love for his daughter, melody. ariel and prince eric appear not to give a hoot about their daughter.   like i said, all they did was use the characters from the first movie and copy them. this is what they did: ursula- the new evil villain is morgana, ursula's sister who feels like she always lived in ursula's shadow. i wouldn't be scared of her if she showed up at my doorway with a knife. she can't do anything right and she's a failure as a villain. she has the same voice ursula did. sebastian & flounder - have been replaced by probably the most stupid sidekicks, tip & dash, a walrus and a penguin. they try to be hero's but always fail when trying. the plot is so predictable. they become heroes at the end. yawn. flatson& jetsom- now replaced by a shark who was turned about 10x smaller by triton. hes really bad too. morgana and the shark (sharkbait, i think was his name) have no chemistry, good or bad. ariel-ah, ariel. our lovely mermaid was replaced by her un-lovely daughter, melody. melody cannot sing, her voice is about 2 octaves higher than it should be, and you want to punch her in the face because shes so fake sugary sweet. she wants to go to the sea, she is clumsy and the kids make fun of her, she has to go find herself. yawn.  not only is the movie boring and unoriginal its so simplistic when you watch this movie you will gasp at how bad it is. certain parts of the movie make you want to call disney up and demand why such a horrible movie was made as a sequel to such a wonderful original.  basically, comparing the little mermaid 2 to the little mermaid is like comparing and ed wood movie to casablanca. don't ever watch this, not even when your bored.",0
"all in all a good film and better for the fact that had the film not been made the story might remain hidden to the masses. brosnan does a good job as the native american with a hidden past and the photography is stunning. to some, this may be too whimsical, to others boring - for me it is a gentle, well-told tale and perfect for family viewing. now that's not something you get a lot of recently.",1
"the premise is simple. this movies starts out looking like your average lame chick flick about two attractive young people meeting each other in an airport, then things take a 180 degree turn...  i for one, really dislike the kind of mind numbing love story nonsense that pollutes the average movie theater. and it is my humble opinion that wes craven, based on his previous meta-horror films (sceam) does too...  following this logic, it's not surprising to find that craven sardonically takes his time to built up a nauseatingly sweet 'sependipity love'-story, only to have an awesome cillian murphy wreck that whole sugar-coated dreamworld...   the scope of his character jackson ripner (jack the ripper, get it? lame, right?) in this film is impressive, he goes from being utterly charming to being a twisted nihilistic sicko, which is a plus in my book. as he proceeds to freak out his victim (jennifer garner lookalike rachel mcadams, who i found pretty annoying by the way), you can't help but sympathize with the guy...  this is wes craven, embodied in jackson ripner, through cillian murphy, bashing all brainless chick flicks...  mr. craven, i salute you.  best quote:  jackson ripner (after beating the snot out of rachel mcadams in the airplane toilet): ""thanks for the quickie!!!""",1
"i really love this movie, saw it again last week after 3 years or so. this movie is perfect, great acting, great story, great directing/camera-work/music. it is a gift to show it to someone you love. too bad jaco van dormael did not make more movies after this one. top 5 work. really!!  today, it's 3 years and 3 days later then the comment above. it was never posted because it was not more than 10 lines. anyway, i saw ""le huitieme jour"" again yesterday. this is with no doubt in my movie top 3. together with ""cinema paradiso"" which is also a masterpiece. the soundtrack is also really good. i am really curious about ""jaco von dormael's"" new movie. i hope it will complete my movie top 3. if you see this movie, rent it. or even better. buy it. because you will want to see it again.",1
"`stanley and iris' is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life. stanley's life is difficult, because he never learned to read or write. iris is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets stanley. she decides to teach stanley how to read at her home in her spare time. over time they become romantically involved. after stanley learns to read, he goes off to a good job in chicago, only to return to iris and ask her to marry him.  it's a really good film without nudity, violence, or profanity, that which is rare in today's films. a good film all round.

"i love the movie. it brought me back to the best time of my life.   we need that time again, now more than ever. for me it was a time of freedom, learning, and finding myself. i will always miss it. there will never be another time like the 60's, unfortunately.",1
"let me state first that i love westerns & civil war stories. i also consider john ford as an excellent director. i also have the same high feelings for john wayne & william holden's acting ability.  i cannot remember if i saw this film when it first came out in 1959. last night was the first time i saw it since then.  as per my 4 rating, one can say i did not like the movie.  i now will attempt to tell some of its shortcomings.  john lee mahin who wrote the screenplay from harold sinclair's novel, was a very gifted writer & wrote many fine scripts, this script is poorly written & badly researched. they make mention of the awful conditions of the andersonville prison, at the time of the movie andersonville was not in operation. they also use rifles that were not used at the time.  john ford was directing films for over 40 years & won 4 oscars. he must have been ill during the making of this.his usual style was missing. it could be that this was film in the south & east and not in monument valley.  he normally had a stock company of players he used in nearly all his film, most were missing this time. this time only minor cowboy stars hoot gibson & ken curtiss have roles & of course anna lee has a small role. there were no other familiar faces except for the 3 stars. (see below) mr. fords stock company made most of his films the classics they were; sadly missed here.  now we come to the main stars john wayne & william holden. the duke also must have been ill,he seemed out of place here. this sort of role usually fit his style perfectly, he was just adequate here. wiliam holden did the best he could, but nowhere as good as he usually was.  it was required that there be an actress in this type of movie. here in her first major role (second film) is constance towers, a very beautiful person, but not really an actress, she is still having roles on television. let me be kind and say she has had a long career,more based on her looks than acting talent. also in caas as ms. towers servant is tennis star althea gibson.i am glad she stuck to tennis.  the rest of the production credits were far from the usual high standard of other john ford films there were a few military type songs supposedly done by the marching cavalry, not good at all. the action scenes were good but come at the end of film.  ratings *1/2* (out of 4) 47 points (out of 100) imdb 4 (out of 10)",0
"a note to all of you budding film writers: study this film. if your dialog reads like the dialog in this film, please shred your script and try again.  i didn't have high expectations, but was intrigued by the description indicating there was a mystery at the christmas ornament factory. the mystery is resolved very early and the film becomes a straight romance. i almost stopped watching it at 5 minutes, 10 minutes, and at the first break. my spouse , who is the hallmark & lifetime fan, gave up at the first break.   forest river is a company town - the main business is aikens ornaments, who make all manner of holiday decorations.the patriarch of the company has recently passed away, so the companies future might be in question. we soon meet noelle, who would rather be on wall street than main street, and the mysterious justin, who gets a date with noelle after a large snowman she is inflating crashes into justins car. once we meet alison aikens, doing due diligence for the board, we have our story setup.  if you can't nail all the story arcs by the first commercial break, you haven't seen enough of this kind of holiday film. maybe that's a good thing.",0
"this 1934 adaptation of somerset maugham's novel put bette davis on the map as a movie actress. she might have won an academy award for her performance but the films was made on loan, so her studio didn't push for her. her acting in this one doesn't come off well by today's standards. as the heartless waitress who jerks philip, a sensitive medical student, around and nearly ruins his life, davis is way too shrill, almost demonic. director john cromwell, who usually elicited good performances from his actresses, was perhaps overwhelmed by this one. davis is watchable, for sure, but so strident and predatory as to seem scarcely human. i imagine the character of millie as quieter, less feminine than davis, with maybe a touch of the tomboy. davis is such a strong, immediate presence that's there's no air of mystery to her, which makes philip's attraction to her seem more overtly masochistic than it should be.  as philip, leslie howard is excellent. his wan, somewhat wilted good looks are perfect for this failed aesthete. nor does he impose a personal interpretation on the part, as, say, dirk bogarde might have done, which gives his work a rare clarity. he seems completely in control here, as he should be, playing a man with a rational intellect who is in the grip of irrational emotions he cannot manage or even fully satisfy, as the object of his affections moves him in ways he cannot understand. howard was a fine actor, too often cast in standard romantic parts which compelled him to fall back on charm, which he doesn't use here.  it's been so long since i've read the book i don't feel comfortable commenting on the movie's faithfulness to it. i think it captures the spirit of the story well enough, and that it has in howard a perfect philip carey. the sexual undercurrents are muted, and at times philip behaves so masochistically that in the absence of strong sex feelings makes one wonder about the character's sanity, surely not mr. maugham's intention. thanks to howard's performance, philip remains firmly in focus, as one can see in his various responses to and yearnings for millie the extremes to which a reasonable intellect will go to understand the irrational, in himself and in others.   overall, a very good film, a little stilted at times, due to its age, it evokes london nicely, and is well acted for the most part.",1
"although it was released way back in 1967, in cold blood still remains the benchmark by which all true-crime films are matched. veteran writer/director richard brooks (elmer gantry) adapted truman capote's non-fiction book into a chilling docudrama that retains a disturbing power even today, thirty-five years later.  robert blake and scott wilson portray perry smith and dick hickock, two ex-cons who, on a tip from hicock's old cellmate floyd wells, broke into the holcomb, kansas home of herbert clutter, looking for a wall safe supposedly containing $10,000. but no safe was ever found, and the two men instead wound up killing mr. clutter, his wife, and their two children, getting away with only a radio, a pair of binoculars, and a lousy forty dollars. two months on the run, including an aimless ""vacation"" in northern mexico, ended in las vegas when cops caught them in a stolen car. but it eventually comes out, after merciless grilling by kansas law enforcement officials, that these two men committed that heinous crime in holcomb. tried and convicted on four counts of murder, they stew in jail over a five-year period of appeals and denials until both are hanged to death on april 14, 1965.  blake and smith are absolutely chilling as the two dispassionate killers who show no remorse for what they've done but are concerned about getting caught. john forsythe also does a good turn as alvin dewey, the chief detective investigating the crime, as does gerald s. o'laughlin as his assistant. in a tactic that is both faithful to capote's book and a good artistic gambit all around, brooks does not show the murders at the beginning; instead, he shows the two killers pulling up to the clutter house as the last light goes out, then cuts to the next morning and the horrifying discovery of the bodies. only during the ride back to kansas, when blake is questioned by forsythe and narrates the story, do we see the true horror of what happened that night. we don't see that much blood being spilled in these scenes, but we don't need to. the shotgun blasts and the horrified look on the clutters' faces as they know they are about to die are more than disturbing enough, so there is no need to resort to explicitly bloody slasher-film violence.  brooks wisely filmed in cold blood in stark black-and-white, and the results are excellent thanks to conrad hall's expertise. the chilling jazz score by quincy jones is the capper. the end result is one of the most unsettling films of any kind ever made, devastating in its own low-key fashion. it is a 134-minute study of a crime that shook an entire state and indeed an entire nation, and should be seen, though viewer discretion is advised; the 'r' rating is there for a reason.",1
"in terms of the arts, the 1970s were a very turbulent era. in literature and the visual arts, it was the closing of a great fifty or sixty year period of creativity that has yet to be restarted. in music it was a decade that many see as a low point, due to corporate rock and disco. on television it was a golden age for situation comedies, from the odd couple to the mary tyler moore show to m*a*s*h to all in the family, but in film it was even a greater period of creativity, in all genres, that saw the rise of the american auteur- directors like robert altman, francis ford coppola, and martin scorsese- from the ashes of the old studio systems that had dominated hollywood for over half a century. these directors wanted to craft literate, arts films for the masses, of the sort that had been staples in europe since the end of the second world war. yet, the studios were trying to keep pace, with socially aware films of the sort not seen since the 1930s.  but, unlike the films of the 1930s, starring actors like jimmy cagney and john garfield (usually co-starring the dead end kids), that dealt with social issues in a gritty realistic way, or as realistic as one could get on a sound stage, the social consciousness of the late 1960s and early 1970s manifested itself most in science fiction films, which allowed the left wing of hollywood to preach to the masses under the guise of what most considered little above comic strip entertainment. there was precedent for this approach, for several of the flying saucer films of the 1950s dealt with the political zeitgeist of the mccarthy era- most notably the day the earth stood still and invasion of the body snatchers. and the early 1960s saw rod serling constantly subverting the political conservatism of the time by casting social issues into science fiction settings on his classic sci fi television anthology show the twilight zone. among the studio offerings of this time were the ecologically sensitive silent running; george lucas's first film thx 1138, which dealt with consumerism, group think, and existentialism; and logan's run, which hammered away at communism and state control versus the rights of an individual. some of the film's references are quite heavyhanded- and reek of the then current arab oil crisis and rampant inflation. a few jarred strawberries cost $150, and soylent rations its assorted colored foods- soylent yellow, soylent red, and the new soylent green, reputedly made from 'the finest undersea growth,' in a manner not unlike the gas rationing of the time. scenes of food riots are eerie echoes of the oil riots at many gas stations during the year of the film's release, and the scenes of crowding, and bodies, live and dead, lying all about are still chilling, as well as influential. a later film like escape from new york is an obvious progeny. the rest of the script, by stanley r. greenberg, however, is rather pedestrian, and fairly standard for a dystopian flick, but fleischer and cinematographer richard h. kline do a great job of filling the screen with interesting images and sounds, to spice things up. the use of soft, dimly lit visuals, murkily filtered, add a stygian feel to the new york of the film, almost like a colorized version of carl theodor dreyer's vampyr. the only light in the film comes from artificial sources, and were it not for the fashion faux pas the film could truly seem timeless.  the end of the film, where thorn sneaks into the processing plant where human corpses are made into soylent green wafers, is both chilling, and oddly drama-less. in the end, the soylent minions hunt thorn down, but he survives long enough to utter the film's catchphrase to chief hatcher. yet, one does not know if it is enough, for hatcher has already been co-opted, and has a track record of taking the easy way out. yet, that fact, and its ambiguity, shows that the film does not recapitulate its characters' dilemmas, and has a depth many later, better made films, sci fi or not, do not have. it is also why soylent green is still a film worth watching.",1
"to me a matter of life and death is just that- simply the best film ever made.  from beginning to end it oozes class. it is stimulating, thought provoking, a mirror to the post war world and the relations between peoples.  the cinematography is simply stunning and the effect of mixing monochrome and technicolour to accent the different worlds works seamlessly. the characters and plot development are near perfect and the attention to detail promotes a thoroughly believable fantasy.  no matter how many times i watch the film - and i have watched it a lot - it never fails to touch me. it makes me smile, it makes me laugh, it makes me think, it makes me cry. it is as fresh today as it was in 1946.  if i were allowed just one film to keep and watch again a matter of life and death would be that film.",1
"a very strange and compelling movie. it's about a very awkward and tightly wound man who attempts to navigate his life as a door-to-door fundraiser/salesman. the director was able to capture a very unnerving tone that really served the story well. original and unsettling while also finding a great deal of humor in the pain that accompanies life. there is a sequence at a testing facility that really stood out and made me laugh out loud which is not something i do as frequently as i should. one of the more memorable films i've seen in a long while. hasn't left my mind and i look forward to future efforts by bronstein. fantastic performances all around. the simple line ""i really appreciate it."" is now iconic to me.",1
"in my eyes this is almost the perfect example of hollywood ego, only beaten by the new king kong movie. superman is the original super hero and deserves to be treated with respect even though he wears tights. brandon routh was the worst superman i've ever seen, from the start of the movie u just wanna shove a chunk of kryptonite down his throat. he looks just silly wearing the costume. but enough about him, kate bosworth was a bad choise for lois lane, she is supposed to be a hard ass reporter, but in this movie she looks more like a schoolgirl. the plot was weak and predictable (wow, he is actually supermans son, who would have ever thought....) and the acting was horrible. this movie has one good thing going for it, and it's name is kevin spacey. his portrayal of lex luthor was brilliant but even he could not save this movie. what this movie needed was the cast of ""lois and clark"" (except kevin spacey of course) and a different story. i watched this movie after watching ""the hills have eyes"" and i was chocked to learn that there existed worse movies then that.",0
"i just have to add, in case anyone actually reads this and hasn't completely gotten the point yet. these other reviewers aren't joking around, this really is the worst colour movie you're likely to ever see. when the movie started i couldn't believe something like this actually made it out for the world to see.  they're not just saying it when they said it looks like a home movie. it really does. like the ""director"" took the family hi8 camcorder (before dv cameras and computer non-linear editing), no other equipment (lights, sound gear, etc), grabbed some decent-looking acting students, and went out to shoot a movie. no script, just making it up as he went along.  when i watched it, it was on my mono tv, so i only have one channel of audio (left of right speaker). at first i thought i'd hooked it up wrong. the movie was silent until someone spoke a couple of minutes in. i got up and switched over to the other channel and suddenly i could hear music and sound effects but then couldn't hear the dialog. they recorded the sound on different bloody channels! i mean, there's movies that can be funny to watch, so bad they're good, kind of thing. i'm not sure this is one of those. i mean, i'll admit to being a bit of a budding film maker. and seeing bad movies just makes you want to go out there and prove you can do it better, you know. but watching this just made me feel sorry for whoever made it.  as bad as they were, the actors are the only good thing about this. i thought the chick was hot and was disappointed in the brevity of her bath scene. a bit of t and a from her would have raised the score from nothing to maybe a 3 or 4. but alas, no. if you want to make a movie but it's turning out crap, throw in some gratuitous nudity. worked for roger corman.",0
"hrm-i think that line was from the old movie posters.  this is a dumb movie that seems to have been translated from some language that was totally unfamiliar to the translator. here's a tip: any movie that starts with a black screen and text reading ""in the future..."" is going to be fun. this means that the premise is so implausible that they have to explain it to you.  in this case, ""in the future..."" means that, instead of fighting wars, nations have guys climb into giant robots and duke it out to determine, well, that's never terribly clear, but it's probably something really important. there are good guys (obviously capitalists, i.e. ""us"") and bad guys (commies!) and there are big stop-motion robots.  sadly, the effects budget was pretty slim, so we don't get to see a lot of the big robots. there are plenty of cheap looking interior scenes, and then a big space fight near the end. the space fight is especially nice, as it serves precisely no purpose other than the blow the remainder of the effects budget.  with said money now spent, the climactic fight degenerates into (and i'm not making this up) two guys hitting each other with sticks. i can always get a laugh in a bar by re-enacting the final scene, complete with a last line guaranteed to leave any audience scratching their heads.  like i said-it's dumb. that's why i bought the tape.",1
for his first ever debut this film has some riveting and chilling moments. in the best horror film fashion the pit of your stomach tightens every moment during this film. the ending is superb. the makers of blaire witch obviously watched this film it's ending wasn't an end but a beginning of the end. a great movie and only a piece of japan's great as far as scare factor a perfect score it makes you think and scared out of your mind.,1
"knowing what to expect (on the whole) from a denzel washington performance - quality, integrity, gravitas, wry humour - will prepare you for what to expect from his directorial debut. much like robert de niro's a bronx tale, antwone fisher delivers the moving drama of the life of a young man and the effects of key figures in his life. much as in a bronx tale de niro played one of these key figures to the lead character (himself a character was born to play but was too old too) washington takes a similar role in this as the fatherly councellor to the titular character - a character that seems like he should be played by a washington from 20 years ago. be thankful washington is too old to play antwone because if he had we would firstly be deprived of the wonderfully measured and intelligently nuanced performance he gives as the navy councellor. however more importantly we wouldn't get to see the superb, we can only hope star making, turn from derek luke in the title role. inevitably the character comes across as moulded in washington's shape, however you get the impression this is not just because washington directed it, not that luke was trying to copy him, but that luke is as genuinely powerful and thought provoking an actor as washington. it took far too long for washington to receive the academy award he deserved for malcolm x, philadelphia, devil in a blue dress and the hurricane, let us hope that luke does not have to wait so long. also a great piece of casting was joy bryant as fisher's girlfriend, cheryl. while the part could have been a forgettable support or a standard 'girlfriend' role bryant imbues it with life. tender and intelligent the role transcends stereotyping with bryant inhabiting it, and she makes the part significant and interesting. it doesn't hurt either that bryant is possibly the most attractive woman you'll see on celluloid this year - the smile alone could thaw the coldest heart. acting ability and looks - why isn't this woman in everything being made right now. providing good support in a small role in salli richardson as washington's wife berta. saying more with a silence or look than many hollywood actresses can manage in an entire film she informs the audience of the entire storylines long before any exposition occurs. as for washington's directing, as i said, it is the directing equivalent of his acting. taking the story of a man few viewers will have heard of and making it genuinely interesting is a difficult feat which washington achieves with aplomb. the film is neither rushed nor showy, but it never feels slow or dull. it is measured and nuanced, balancing the humour and drama perfectly. antwone fisher may not blow you away if you like big, explosive, plotless hollywood films but for those who appreciate a finely crafted character piece, with excellent performances and steady well handled direction, this is for you.",1
"while it certainly wasn't the best movie i've ever seen, it was certainly worth the $8 (which can't be said for many movies these days.)  this was a pleasant account of a true story, although many of the details of the real story were twisted for the movie, (ie, billy sunday's character was three or four people in the real story combined together.) robert deniro was of course good, and cuba gooding, jr., was also impressive.",1
"""scary movie 2"" is a let down to the scary movie franchise. scary movie 1, 3 and 4 were all good but this one was kind of boring and not very funny. luckily they picked their act up after this one and made two more great scary movies.  this film is about a group of teens who get tricked by their professor into going to a haunted mansion for a night. things start to go wrong and then they realize they have to escape.  this movie isn't horrible but they could have improved quite a few things. it is a bit of fun and if you liked the other movies in the scary movie franchise then give this a watch - but i don't think you will like it nearly as much.",0
"a scientist and his girl friend are out driving when his speeding causes a car crash. he escapes unharmed but she is decapitated. he saves her head, brings it to his house and keeps it alive (!!!!). he then proceeds to search out models and strippers for the perfect body for the head. his crippled assistant watches over the head which starts talking and has a telepathic (or telepathetic) link to a deformed monster kept in the closet....  as you can see, this is pretty stupid stuff, but i had a certain fondness for it. when i grew up in the late 1970s, a local tv station showed this movie about 20 times each year (no exaggeration). they showed it always on saturday afternoon tv--uncut. seeing this on tv back then was great! explicit blood and gore along with a gruesome monster and sleazy sexploitation--who cares if it was good? seeing it now i realize how lousy this really is.  the acting is perfectly wretched, the production values are nonexistent, the script is pretty dumb and (aside from the still pretty disgusting gore) this is dull stuff. there's also a mild cat fight between two women and the admittedly great monster at the end. also add in an ending which leaves tons of loose ends. on one hand this is an interesting example of a 1960s exploitation film. on the other its utter trash. either way, it's not a good movie but is a must-see (for one time only) for horror and gore fans.  also the head's laugh is pretty creepy. note the end credits which gets the title wrong (calling it ""the head that wouldn't die"")!",0
certainly any others i have seen pale in comparison. the series gives balanced coverage to all theatres of operation. no one country is given undue credit for the allied victory. laurence olivier brings great weight and dignity to his role as narrator.,1
"(you'll know what i mean after you've seen red eye...)   overall, red eye was a better-than-expected thriller. it gets off to a slow start, and slowly builds. but by the time it was over, it's a thumper!   it's hard to exactly define what makes this thriller as... thrilling as i found it. except that, simply put, the director did a creditable job of pulling you into the action of what would otherwise have been a run-of-the-mill plot. i rather tended to forget i was watching a movie. that says a lot.  other factors, i think, are the ""closeness"" of victim and bad guy... and that over time, you begin to really relate to the victim. a scant 8 out of 10, more like a 7.5... but that's pretty good!",1
"it's been so long since i've seen this movie (at least 15 years) and yet it still haunts me with a vivid image of the horrific consequences that prisoners of war can face despite the terms of the geneva convention.  a unit of australian underwater demolitions experts are captured in an archipelago near japan following a successful mission to set mines in a japanese harbor.  once in prison these men expect the same treatment as any other pows but to their dismay soon learn from a friendly japanese prison guard that they are being tried as spies since they were out of uniform when captured. the consequences of such an infraction, by japanese martial code, is execution by beheading.  despite their pleas, and the pleas of the sympathetic prison guard, the day of reckoning approaches like a ticking time bomb. the tension is so high you will actually hear the ticking, though it may just be your chest pounding with the percussion of a marching execution squad.  the ending is actually too painful to reenact in my head much less write it here. but i can promise you-- you'll never forget it. good luck finding the video in the u.s.",1
"this was a fairly creepy movie; i found the music to be effective for this. the photographs mario took of the village were also unnerving. however, i had three problems with this film. one is that the lighting was very dark so some of the time it was hard to tell what was going on, but this may have just been my copy. the second is that the very beginning is not explained very well and i'm still not sure what was going on there. the third problem is that i didn't understand the ending, but apparently some people do. of course there are also the usual problems of people doing stupid things, and the male lead is very 70s. all in all, watchable but not even close to being a favorite.",0
"where the hell are all these uncharted islands where prehistoric monsters lurk, evil doctors perform their experiments, madmen hold the ultimate karate championship, and the uber-rich hunt humans for sport? i had no idea there were still so many uncharted islands out there, but if you take into account the number of movies that utilize one of these mysterious islands as a location, you'd have to assume that there are at least 50 of these suckers out there. it always winds up feeling so damned convenient and i immediately deduct points from any movie that uses this hackneyed device. hammerhead is the story of a mad scientist who is conducting experiments on one of these uncharted islands, so the movie already had a lot to make up for before it even began.  the island in this movie used to belong to dr. moreau, but has recently been purchased by the re-animator himself, jeffrey combs. old jeffrey is doing some kind of cutting edge stem cell research, which has led him to start working with sharks while searching for a cure for cancer. if that sounds familiar, that's because this is roughly the same basic set-up as the smart shark facility in deep blue sea, not to mention a host of other nu image movies. so apparently, jeffrey's son was dying of cancer which prompted our mad doctor to start experimenting on his progeny. he did some kind of super fancy gene splicing and so forth, turning his son into a shark-man.  william forsythe leads a crew of unknown actors to the island to look into the doctor's experiments. if someone would have given him a sailor's hat, william would have been a dead ringer for the skipper from gilligan's island. in typical bond villain fashion, the doctor decides that all of these intruders would make nice chum for his son. not chums, like buddies... chum, like shark food. so enter shark-boy who starts stalking the skipper and his cohorts all over the island. they, of course, make half-hearted attempts to escape and are thwarted over and over again while being chased by a guy in a rubber shark-man suit.   the movie didn't make up any of the points that it lost for taking place on one of those dastardly deserted islands. it's funny that this movie is called hammerhead, it made me think of an old joke. why do you hit yourself in the head with a hammer? because it feels so good when you stop. that's pretty much how this movie is. the only reason to watch it is because it feels so good when it's over.",0
"this is a superbly imaginative low budget sci-fi movie from cult director vincenzo natali. the film plays out like a crossing of phillip k dick with hitchcock and cronenberg and the film takes on a unique feel like nothing you would have seen. the film is superbly shot, i love the cinematography in this, it feels fresh and original. plot-wise the film explores similar themes to films like total recall, dark city and the matrix and its pretty staple sci-fi stuff. morgan sullivan (jeremy northam) is a suburbanite who is bored with his life and has decided to take a job as a company spy for digicorp, a large technological corporation. he meets up with a recruitment officer at the beginning who brings sullivan on board and instructs him on what he has to do. it basically involves going to conferences of rival companies and recording them via a satellite transmission device disguised as a pen. it also means that he must take on a different persona and keep it a secret from his wife. after his first job things become strange, his habits change, his personality begins to differ and he suffers pains in his neck and headaches as well as nightmares. he encounters a beautiful woman named rita foster (played by an intriguingly cast lucy liu.) he takes an instant attraction to. however when he goes in his next job and sees her again she reveals herself to be an agent of some sort who reveals that his job is not quite what it seems. he finds out later on that he and the rest of the people attending the conference all work for digicorp. the conferences are all covers to allow the company men to brainwash their spies. sullivan, whose alternate name is jack thursby has been given an antidote to digicorps drugging and while the rest of the spies at the latest conference drift off into what seems like a brain-dead day dream while the speakers drone on (the speakers send all the attendants to sleep via subliminal messages.) suddenly the rooms lights turn off and workers at digicorp come in shining lights in all the occupants eyes to ensure they are not conscious and then in a fairly nightmarish situation they bring in head sets for each member which send messages into the brain and brainwash the precipitants into believing they are someone else. digicorp are using these people as puppets and creating personalities and lives for these people while wiping their own existence. sullivan now must pretend that he entirely believes he is now jack thursby. digicorp want to steal information from their rivals samways and they want their own puppets to do it, they now effectively control what these spies do, except for sullivan. when samways get a hold of sullivan and discover he has not actually been brainwashed they decide to use him as a pawn to spy on digicorp, make sullivan a double agent. they know that digicorp have sent thursby to them to work his way into samways and work his way up the system until he can get into a situation to download important company information that could shut the company down. samways realises he had been planted and decide they will play along with digicorp and allow thursby to infiltrate their databanks but they will give digicorp a dodgy disc that will ruin their system. the plot begins to twist and turn as both companies are using sullivan as a pawn. he is stuck in the middle and rita foster is a mystery as he tries to work out why she is helping him. when a mysterious third party becomes involved, the person it is revealed that foster works for, sullivan must decide whether to go to this freelance agent, who could guarantee him a new life and safety or to stick with one of the companies he works for. the tension all builds to a stonking climax as it seems just about everyone wants to dispose of him once his usefulness has expires. the cast are great. northam is superb and the subtlety in his performance is excellent. he brings a great visual aspect to his performance, his eyes tell a story and we see a great subtle change as his character changes from sullivan to thursby. lucy liu is just sexy beyond belief and her presence gives a great dynamic to the film because it seems strange casting but works because of that fact. the rest of the cast are also good.  director natali whose previous film was the cult classic sci-fi flick cube, has a real visual flair. he paces the film superbly as well and has given it a great look. for a low budget film it features some imaginative visual effects and although the cgi isn't great it never begins too much of a centre piece to effect the film negatively. the film really does bring feelings of the matrix and other great sci-fi films, it is up there with them. the plot nearly becomes too convoluted at times but in truth that helps in a film like this, that is where the cronenberg and lynch influence is evident. the film has you constantly working out what is going on and genuinely surprises as it goes along. this is overall an obvious cult classic and i can see this being incredibly popular when it is released in the states. ****1/2  ",1
"caught part of george 2 on tv recently, but couldn't get myself to watch it through to the end. just awful! i can't even remember the plot. all i know is that george and ursula were not the george and ursula of the first movie, which was bad enough. there's a lot of scrambling around, but the direction and editing were so shoddy and choppy, it was like watching outtakes or deleted scenes. having the original voice of ape the ape back was not nearly enough to make me warm up to this. george 2 is probably the single worst sequel i have ever seen, and that is saying something. jeez, because of imdb's 10 lines rule, i have to keep typing when i have nothing more to say about this crapulastic made-for-tv sequel. disney, hang your head in shame.",0
"despite the patronage of george lucas, this captivating and totally original fantasy in ""lumage"" (a combination of animation through live action cut-outs) is about as far removed from the usual kiddie fare as anything made by ralph bakshi in his heyday. brilliantly conceived characters such as the shape-shifting dog ralph (one of a duo of bumbling, rejected heroes), synonamess botch (the hilariously foul-mouthed villain) and rod rescueman (the pompous novice superhero) breathe life into a uniquely clever concept: frivoli vs. murkwood or, the eternal fight between dreams and nightmares. in this context, the mor-infused songs on the soundtrack ought not to have worked but somehow they do. it's a real pity, therefore, that i have had to watch this via a truly crappy-looking boot (culled from a tv screening) of the uncensored version  there is also a milder variant that toned down the language for its vhs release  since the film is otherwise unavailable on dvd. interestingly, both henry selick and david fincher worked on this picture in subordinate capacities.",1
"i stopped watching this pos as soon as the snakes started ""taking over"" the plane.  at first i thought maybe it should get a ""one"" for the comic relief. but then i realized i could just watch the three stooges for free and laugh more!   whatever respect i might have had for samuel jackson has been irreversibly destroyed. and hollywood demonstrates once again how removed from reality they really are. when i was a kid we used to catch snakes for fun. the only thing snakes would do is huddle at the bottom of the cargo bay. and no amount of hollywood cartoon snakes can change that.  this movie isn't worth a trip to blockbuster. be warned: if you pay for it, the only ""victim"" is your dumb ass.  if you want to be really scared, i suggest the descent. if you want humor, go to your local stand up comedy club. their worst performer will be a million times better than this trash.",0
"***one out of ten stars***   because if it was, it gets an f. holy mother mary of god was this bad. i mean, i gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film, but it let me down at every turn. like so many other b movies, the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources, but the execution was ridiculous. it's a shame they attached the good name of halloween to this fiasco.  the basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual halloween haunted house fund raiser, when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys into a living hell. well that's the idea anyway, but instead most of the film is devoted to displaying these frat boy's relationship escapades, abound with an outrageous lesbian subplot. very little of the actual story is devoted to halloween or the mysterious spell book. it actually makes me mad that the film makers thought they could get away with making such dribble.   the film is essentially about frat boy relationships. this is not what the movie is billed as. i'm tempted to track down the producers and at the very least threaten them with bodily harm. the acting is about as bad as it gets, it's atrocious! the script is unintentionally funny. the cinematography is just plain lazy. the whole film is amateur night. this movie actually makes the syfy channel movie productions look like masterpieces.  the last half hour of the film felt like the film makers realized they weren't producing a soap opera and had to throw in some sort of horror sequences. the evil spell book finally comes into play and turns everyone in the haunted house into the character their dressed up as. i almost feel like crying as i write this review. wow! i mean wow! this thing was an undecipherable chopped up disaster.",0
"there's no shortage of bad dialogue in david and bathsheba  ""i was quite a hand with a slingshot,"" ""the king of all israel out there in the darkness exposing himself to the enemy"" (full marks to dennis hooey for delivering that one with a straight face), ""go and sit with the concubines."" and somehow i doubt a bored david ever told the prophet nathan ""whatever you say."" he even tries the old ""my kingdom doesn't understand me"" routine on desperate housewife bathsheba at one point. so it's probably a tribute to henry king's direction that the film isn't at all bad despite the pitfalls much of the first third provide. maybe it's the censor-baiting nature of the plot  a married man kills a femme fatale's husband and gets away with it!  but king brings out the growing moral and theological complexities in phillip dunne's script rather than upping the sin and sandals hokum. this is the conflicted david on the downhill slope, abandoned by a vengeful god he no longer understands, and the film doesn't back away from the awkward unanswerable questions about why a loving deity would choose to wreak vengeance on the innocent rather than the guilty. it even offers a genuinely surprising criticism of the sexual inequality of the law, where the failings of husbands result in the punishment of their wives.  unlike king david, which sidelined the king in favour of the admittedly more interesting saul, david is firmly at the centre of the drama and despite an interesting display of shoulder twitching and a frankly gormless overlong close-up when visiting the site of saul and jonathan's death, gregory peck's performance grows in stature as david shrinks. susan hayward is pure hollywood pro, raymond massey is an appropriately theatrical prophet (why be naturalistic when you've got a voice that makes the very heavens quake?) and kieron moore's uriah such an intransigent unreconstructed chauvinist that you can't exactly blame david for putting him in harm's way, but despite threatening to soft peddle the film doesn't allow david a moral get out of jail free card over his death. with surprisingly strong but subdued design and technicolor photography this is definitely a cut above most 40s-50s biblical epics.  fox's new dvd is a good transfer, including an incredibly hokey 'candid' behind-the-scenes short and a trailer with brief shots deleted from the film's sole battle scene.",1
one of the comedies of the 1970's. also has the best signature tune of any comedy show. the story is about three people sharing a flat living above their landlords george and mildred. the comedy rests on the mix of the people sharing. a man and two women. richard o' sullivan is besotted with paula wilcox. its played in a gentle and not a leering way which is why this show was such a success.  the scripts and the stars were always giving the best performances and richard's frustrated love life was shown with a relaxed charm. the end titles contained visual jokes which went unnoticed in the early 1970's but concerned the flat sharers living arrangements.,1

"while the original titillates the intellect, this cheap remake is designed purely to shock the sensibilities. instead of intricate plot-twists, this so-called thriller just features sudden and seemingly random story changes that serve only to debase it further with each bizarre development. worst of all, replacing the original spicy dialog is an overturned saltshaker full of unnecessary four-letter words, leaving behind a stark, but uninteresting taste.  there was promise--unfulfilled promise. the prospect of michael caine pulling off a patty duke-like keller-to-sullivan graduation is admittedly intriguing. unfortunately, this brilliant and respected actor only tarnished his reputation, first by accepting the role in this horribly re-scripted nonsense and then by turning in a performance that only looks competent when compared to jude law's amateurish overacting.  if you haven't seen the classic original, overlook its dated visuals and gimmicks. hunt it down, watch it, and just enjoy a story-and-a-half. as for the remake, pass on this insult to the original.",0
"went to see the movie ""troy"" this afternoon. here's what i learned:  contrary to popular opinion and history in general, greek men were not gay. ever. this was clearly established immediately at the start of the film and reinforced every five minutes or so thereafter. so it is safe for american dudes to see this movie.  helen of troy always had impeccable hair and makeup. she looked gorgeous in all of her brief cameo scenes which, though numerous, were probably all filmed on the same day, one after the other, with the director saying, ""alright, now look beautiful . . . good ... ok, now look frightened ... good... now look depressed ... good ... now look interested . . . good ... now look beautiful again ... good...""  most greek and trojan men had british accents. those with american accents couldn't act.  trojans looked just like greeks, but they tended to stay on the right side of the screen.  brad pitt does not blink on camera.  helen of troy's biggest line was, ""they're coming for me.""  trojan music sounded remarkably like modern bulgarian music.  brad pitt's thighs go all the way up.  achilles had a young male friend with whom he was very close, but it's ok. they were cousins. never mind what history says.  peter o'toole can tell an entire story with just an expression.  trojan gods apparently all had greek names, but their statues either looked egyptian or like peter o'toole in drag.  greek men never touched each other unless they were fighting, much like american men.  all of the thousands of extras in the movie had exactly the same skin color... light egyptian, by max factor.  troy had only three women.  there were lots of blond greeks, which is good news for brad pitt, who would otherwise have really stuck out.  despite their coastal desert locale, greeks had the uncanny ability to find unlimited amounts of timber to build fires, funeral pyres, trojan horses and the like.  british actors look silly with greek hairdos.  brad pitt changes expression only when the sun is shining directly in his eyes.  greek soldiers fought constantly, but their outfits always looked impeccable.  greek soldiers wore underwear under their skirts.  apparently greek temples were always in ruins, even back when they were all new.",0

"i'd have given this film a few stars, simply because it was a ""lifetime"" presentation actually filmed in the location represented in the story - here, new york city. most on this channel, whether ""set"" there, in rural iowa, oregon, virginia, l.a. etc., are filmed in vancouver, ottawa, toronto or some other canadian locale.  but if there ever were one deserving the top rating - 10* on this site, it's this movie. certainly not for originality, for this story has been done many times, in many variations, with several very similar to this specific one. it's also been done pretty often on the big screen, with mega-stars, past and present, from cary grant, james garner, harrison ford, tom hanks, et al - and deborah kerr, doris day, meg ryan, and many more. i can think of at least 10-12 more, just as prominent, past to present, off the top of my head, who could be added now, and there are probably many others which could be brought to mind.  not to drone on, but my point is that, in my opinion, this is by far one of the best of this genre i've seen. i caught it by chance on a mid-day friday, at a time when i had the tv on only because i was taking a couple of hours following a particularly hectic week. i'd never run across this flick in the 8 years since it was made. and, while the two leads have done enough to be known to most, they were completely unknown to me. the only two actors i knew were phyllis newman (anna's mother) whom i'd seen in some things from her younger days, and michael rispoli (henry, charlie's best friend) who was outstanding as ""gramma,"" the menacing juice loan, tough, street guy from ""rounders.""   the chance meeting and coupling between both leads' best friends, as a sub-story romance, with the correlation of their being such to anna and charlie being only revealed to all later, is an oft-done plot contrivance within the genre, but makes no difference to the enjoyment here (in fact, it enhances it).  checking some other comments, i agree completely with those which are the most positive. the primary word describing this film is engaging, in caps. this adjective describes the performers; the characters; the chemistry between and among all of the characters, in whatever combination presented, and all of the supporting and even minor roles.  i love films with a ""harder edge:"" ""rounders;"" the escapist schwarzenegger/stallone fare; ""goodfellows;"" even the classics like ""casablanca,"" ""gone with the wind,"" ""citizen kane."" but for pure, uncomplicated enjoyment, this one was outstanding. with a bare fraction of their budgets, it was equal to the results achieved by ""you've got mail"" and ""sleepless in seattle."" and tom hanks and meg ryan couldn't have done better than natasha henstridge and michael vartan here; the co-stars and support personnel here were equivalent to those in these mega-films, as well.",1
"another double noir on one disc from warner home video and by far the better of the two movies is rko's marvellous 1950 thriller ""where danger loves"". this is a memorable classic with a great cast in robert mitchum, faith domergue and claude rains. crisply photographed in black & white by nicholas musuraca it was tightly directed by john farrow. ""where danger lives"" is a prime example of the noir style of picture making and will always be remembered for its stylish craftsmanship that was hollywood's past - (see my full review).  unfortunately, none of the above praise can be applied to the second movie on the disc, the abysmal mgm 1949 stinker tension! poorly written (allen rivkin) and directed by john berry this movie is full of ludicrous characterisations and unlikely situations. the inconceivable relationship between a mild mannered and wimpish pharmacist - blandly played by richard baseheart - and his overtly floozy wife (a risible audrey totter) is totally implausible and unconvincing (how on earth they ever got together in the first place is anybody's guess). then when she ""unsurprisingly"" ditches him for one of her playmates (lloyd gough) our timid pharmacist, instead of being euphoric and over the moon with his new found good fortune, plots revenge and attempts to kill gough but at the last minute chickens out. the guy gets murdered anyway and our pharmacist is immediately suspected by homicide detective barry sullivan (another bland performance). so who did kill him? well, at this stage of the movie you really couldn't care less since it is all so badly executed and rendered ridiculous by director berry. mr. berry has no idea of pacing and is unable to inject even a smidgen of style into the thing. there is nothing he can put in front of the camera that will prevent you from nodding off! the only tension contained in this movie is in the rubber band that is stretched to its limit and snaps in the fingers of barry sullivan as he gives the intro at the film's opening. so much for that! a most unfortunate effort! c'est la vie!  best things about this turkey is the smooth monochrome cinematography by the great harry stradling, an effective score by a young andre previn and an early dramatic appearance by the lovely cyd charisse before she found her dancing shoes. hey! - maybe she could have saved the picture had she given us a few steps and a couple of pirouettes! huh?  in its favour however, are the heaps of extras that are included which boasts trailers, commentaries and featurettes for both films. but the disc is worth it alone for the rko mitchum classic!",0
"it could have been better had it been directed by someone with more experience. shumlin didn't do a bad job but it is not a great work of cinematic art.  it is, however, a beautiful movie. i have loved it since local channels used to show it. graham greene is one of my favorite writers of the last century. some pretty bad movies were made from his novels and stories. (many love ""the fallen idol"" but i am not among them. i think i saw ""brighton rock"" once many years ago and liked it but maybe i'm simply thinking fondly of the novel.) this is superbly cast. charles boyer does not, it's true, come across as spanish. but he seems to have the perfect temperament for this character -- tired, wary, caring. lauren bacall is appealing as the british girl who falls for him. but the supporting players are the best: katina paxinou is excellent. her performance is a little grand guignol, but i attribute that to the director. peter lorre, whom we first meet as he gives boyer a lesson in an esperanto-like universal language, is excellent -- as always.  and wanda hendrix could break the hardest heart. she comes across as a precocious early teenager. the character wants to be helpful. she does her best.  i recommend this movie highly. not without reservations. the reservation is, primarily, that it is a little stolid. but the story and acting can scarcely be bettered.",1

"johnny and jeremy are vampires of sorts. minus the fangs, of course. they're dark, bitter creatures with nothing better to do than to spread their own misery. through their charms (namely a sharp tongue and a fat wallet, respectively) they seduce desperate souls, who they proceed to torment and victimize. that's more or less the basis of this black comedy, as i understand it.  it's not a blend of black humor that i can easily subscribe to, partly because it bothers me to imagine the audience rooting for the sleazy, main character. i did enjoy, however, the sound and the melody of the rapid-fire (and supposedly very witty) remarks. i was very impressed by the cast's strong acting, particularly david thelis's; only the character of jeremy seemed too bi-dimensional. the photography and the music, both dramatic and somber, work very well together.   what really turns me off about ""naked"" (and the main reason i'd never recommend it to anyone) is the way it repeatedly seems to present misogyny as a valid way to vent one's angst. in other words, in a world that sucks so bad, what difference does it make if one inflicts some pain on girls, right? to suggest (as some have on this website) that johnny is not so unkind a person because he's not as rough on girls as jeremy, seems completely absurd to me. they're both terrible, nasty people. and they're particularly keen on hurting women every single time they get a chance. one could argue that johnny eventually gets what he deserves, as if his bad karma suddenly swung straight back and bit him in the ass. but still, his and jeremy's sadistic behavior are treated to a certain degree as a laughing matter. and i could be wrong, but i'm guessing that most people who absolutely love this movie also find that aspect of the film darkly comical.",0
"on the 26th of september 1983 a short dumpy 60 year old woman stood trial for the attempted murder of leonie haddad, a lady whose husband had recently died and had agreed to take in a lodger who came via a housing authority for the elderly. haddad was not made aware that her new lodger had, in fact, come fresh from the patton state mental hospital where she had been incarcerated for an inexplicable knife attack on a married couple three years previously. haddad soon realised that something was 'rotten in denmark' when the woman began to lock herself in the bathroom with a tape recorder reciting prophesies about' seven gods'. haddad's fears were confirmed one night when she awoke to find her lodger sitting astride her chest holding a bread knife announcing that ""god has inspired me to kill you"". haddad managed to knock her assailant out with a telephone but not before she had lost a finger and suffered deep lacerations to her face and chest. it was a miracle she survived. the lodger was judged to be innocent by reason of insanity but sent, kicking and screaming, back to the laughing academy. ten years later she was released and found that she was now a celebrity; but not for the brutal attacks on her innocent victims, but for her incarnation of 25 years earlier when she was known as the 'queen of the curve's, the 'tennessee tease' and 'miss pin up girl of the world' - the notorious bettie page.   director mary harron, mainly known for 'american psycho' takes us back to the glory days of a legendary cheesecake and bondage model (played solidly enough by gretchen mol) who inadvertently wrote the blue print for fetish iconography and whose influence can be detected in everything from comic books to catwalks. t.n.b.p is day-glo fun ride through an evocative depiction of the 1950's where page, with the familial help of good intentioned boyfriends and photographers, becomes the number one star of pocket sized men's glossies with titles like wink, tab and parade. her real dream of movie stardom evades her and a brush with the authorities over obscenity charges in 1957 is the inciting incident which leads her to retire from modelling and give herself to god. the overall style of the film is light and frothy and only darkens momentarily with an allusion to her father's incestuous attentions and a sexual assault which inexplicably appears to have no discernible effect on her. mol plays page as she seems in her photographs, happy, carefree and fun - even the bondage shots betray little more than a good humoured incomprehensibility. the film ends on the upbeat with page cheerfully handing out bibles in a park with no indication of the real life unhappy marriages, personal tragedy and decent into murderous insanity which lay before her; avoiding what i think is the essential core of page's story - rebirth and resurrection.   having emerged from a decade of incarceration page found that her cult had been in the ascendance since the mid 1980's and that she had become a huge underground icon, during which, many were asking ""whatever happened to bettie page"". her 'mysterious' disappearance fed the fires of any number of conspiracy theories only adding to the allure of her legend. when the world's media finally caught up with her she gave no hint of her darker past and she was soon giving interviews for magazines, t.v and being photographed at playboy parties with the likes of pamela anderson and the equally tragic anna nicole smith. she found that she was now more famous than she ever was in her 'glory years' but in the glare of this 'resurrection' it was only a matter of time before the full story would come to light.   the only notorious thing about the notorious bettie page is they left out the part when she became truly notorious.",0

"seldom seen since theatrical release in 1970, myra breckinridge has become a byword for cinematic debacles of legendary proportions. now at last on dvd in an unexpectedly handsome package, it is as unlikely to win wide audiences today as it was when first released.   gore vidal's 1968 bestseller was a darkly satirical statement. most filmmakers felt that the novel's story, structure, and overall tone would not translate to film, and industry insiders were surprised when 20th century fox not only acquired the rights but also hired vidal to adapt his novel to the screen. but studio executives soon had cold feet: vidal's adaptations were repeatedly rejected and novice writer-director michael sarne was brought in to bring the film to the screen.  studio executives hoped that sarne would tap into the youth market they saw as a target for the film, but sarne proved even more out of synch with the material than the executives themselves. rewrite upon rewrite followed. the cast, sensing disaster, became increasingly combative. in her dvd commentary, star raquel welch says that she seldom had any idea of what myra's motives were from scene to scene or even within any single scene itself, and that each person involved seemed to be making an entirely different film. in the accompanying ""back story"" documentary, rex reed says that myra breckinridge was a film made by a bunch of people who hid in their dressing rooms while waiting for their lawyers to return their calls.  the accuracy of these comments are demonstrated by the film itself. the basics of vidal's story are there, but not only has the story been shorn of all broader implications, it seems to have no point in and of itself. everything runs off in multiple directions, nothing connects, and numerous scenes undercut whatever logic previous scenes might have had. and while director sarne repeatedly states in his commentary that he wanted to make the film as pure farce, the only laughs generated are accidental.  chief among these accidents is mae west. it is true that west is unexpectedly well preserved in appearance and that she had lost none of her way with a one-liner--but there is no getting around the fact that she is in her seventies, and her conviction that she is the still the sexiest trick in shoe leather is extremely unsettling, to say the least. but worse, really, is the fact that west is outside her era. her efforts to translate herself into a hip and happening persona results in one of the most embarrassing self-caricatures ever seen on film.  the remaining cast is largely wasted. raquel welch, a significantly underestimated actress, plays the title role of myra very much like a barbie doll on steroids; non-actor rex reed is unexpectedly effective in the role of myron, but the entire role is essentially without point. only john huston and cameo players john carradine, jim backus, william hopper, and andy devine emerge relatively unscathed. yes, it really is the debacle everyone involved in the film feared it would be: fast when it should be slow, slow when it should be fast, relentlessly unfunny from start to finish. it is true that director sarne does have the occasional inspired idea--as in his use of film clips of everyone from shirley temple to judy garland to create counterpoint to the action--but by and large, whenever sarne was presented with a choice of how to do something he seems to have made the wrong one.  the how and why of that is made clear in sarne's audio commentary. sarne did not like the novel or, for that matter, the subject matter in general. he did not want to write the screenplay, but he needed the money; he emphatically did not want to direct the film, but he need the money. he makes it very clear that he disliked author gore vidal and rex reed (at one point he flatly states that reed ""is not a nice person""), and to this day he considers that vidal and reed worked in tandem to sabotage the film because he refused to play into their 'homosexual agenda'--which, when you come right down to it, seems to have been their desire that sarne actually film vidal's novel rather than his own weirdly imagined take-off on it.  although he spends a fair amount of commentary time stating that the film is widely liked by the gay community, sarne never quite seems to understand that the appeal of the film for a gay audience arises from his ridiculously inaccurate depiction of homosexual people. when taken in tandem with the film itself, sarne emerges as more than a little homophobic--and quite frankly the single worst choice of writers and directors that could have been made for this project.  in addition to the sarne and welch commentaries and the making-of documentary, the dvd release includes several trailers and two versions of the film: a ""theatrical release"" version and a ""restored"" version. the only difference between the two is that the final scene in the ""restored"" version has been printed to black and white. the edits made before the film went into general release have not been restored, but the documentary details what they were. the widescreen transfers of both are remarkably good and the sound is quite fine. but to end where i began, this is indeed a film that will most interest film historians, movie buffs, and cult movie fans. i give it three out of five stars for their sake alone, but everyone else should pass it by.  gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer",0
"that's the sound of stan and ollie spinning in their graves.  i won't bother listing the fundamental flaws of this movie as they're so obvious they go without saying. small things, like this being ""the all new adventures of laurel and hardy"" despite the stars being dead for over thirty years when it was made. little things like that.   a bad idea would be to have actors playing buffoons whom just happen to be called laurel and hardy. as bad as that is, it might have worked. for a really bad idea, try casting two actors to impersonate the duo. okay, they might claim to be nephews, but the end result is the same.  bronson pinchot can be funny. okay, forget his wacky foreigner ""cousin larry"" schtick in perfect strangers, and look at him in true romance. here though, he stinks. it's probably not all his fault, and, like the director and the support cast - all of who are better than the material - he was probably just desperate for money. there are those who claim americans find it difficult to master an effective english accent. this cause is not helped here by pinchot. what is stan? welsh? iranian? pakistani? only in stan's trademark yelp does he come close, though as the yelp is overdone to the point of tedium that's nothing to write home about. gailard sartain does slightly better as ollie, though it's like saying what's worse - stepping in dog dirt or a kick in the knackers?   remember the originals with their split-second timing, intuitive teamwork and innate loveability? well that's absent altogether, replaced with two stupid old men and jokes so mistimed you could park a bus through the gaps. whereas the originals had plots that could be summed up in a couple of panels, this one has some long-winded mummy hokum (and what a lousy title!) that's mixed in with the boys' fraternity scenario. i can't claim to have seen every single one of laurel and hardy's 108 movies, but i think it's a safe bet that even their nadir was leagues ahead of this.  maybe the major problem is that the originals were sort-of playing themselves, or at least using their own accents. it at least felt natural and unforced, as opposed to the contrived caricatures pinchot and sartain are given. and since when did stan do malapropisms, and so many at that? ""i was gonna give you a standing cremation""; ""i would like to marinate my friend."" stop it!   only notable moment is a reference to bozo the clown, the cartoon character who shared larry harmon's l & h comic. harmon of course bought the name copyright (how disconcerting to see a ® after laurel and hardy) and was co-director and producer of this travesty.   questions abound. would stan and ollie do fart gags if they were alive today? would they glass mummies with broken bottles? have stan being smacked in the genitals with a spear and end on a big cgi-finale? let's hope not.  i did laugh once, but i think that was just in disbelief at how terrible it all is. why was this film made in the first place? who did the makers think would like it? possibly the worst movie i've ever seen, an absolute abhorrence i grew sick of watching after just the first five minutes. about as much fun as having your head trapped in a vice while a red-hot poker and stinging nettles are forcibly inserted up your back passage.",0
"this film actually works from a fairly original idea - i've never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway. however, the way that it executes this idea isn't original in the slightest; we follow a bunch of kids that, for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest. the fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecks/nutcases/zombies etc; but really, the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme. many films of this ilk don't have a single good idea - and it would seem that this one has worn its brain cells out with just that one. the only real asset that the monsters bring to the table is the fact that they're beautiful women that the characters lust for, rather than being hideous grotesques that they want to run away from. this is good up until a point; but it soon gets boring, and the almost complete lack of any back-story surrounding the central monsters ensures that the film is never going get itself out of the 'horror trash' category.  it's been years since the evil dead made the woodlands a prime horror location, and in spite of films like the blair witch project; it still makes for an excellent horror setting. this is one of the film's major assets, as the forest presents a good impression of the unknown - the only problem is that forest of the damned doesn't ever seem to have much up its sleeve. the death sequences show a distinct lack of imagination, and the fact that all the characters are clichéd in the extreme doesn't help, as you're more likely to be looking forward to seeing them get killed rather than hoping they can get away. the cast is made up of kids mainly, but there is a role here for tom savini; who unfortunately doesn't get to have fun in the special effects department. the only real highlight the film has where personnel are concerned comes from the nymphs themselves. the naked ladies tend to look great, and if it wasn't for them, this film would get very boring very quickly. there's nothing to recommend this film for really; but if you want a daft little horror film that harks back to the style of eighties woodland flicks, you might find some enjoyment here.",0
"it's a bad season for bollywood with all the big releases with a massive hype surrounding proving to be duds at the box office. london dreams is no exception to that. let's dissect it... it's all about chasing your dreams and how far will you go to achieve it. sounds impressive right? but unfortunately the film is not.  arjun (ajay devgan) is an aspiring musician who wants to make it big someday. his dream is to perform in wembley stadium in front of a cheering 90,000 audience calling out his name. he is joined by two brothers, zoheb & wasim (debutants aditya roy & ranvijay) and a ravishing priya (asin). together they form ""london dreams"" their dream band. after impressing the chief of a record company, they become overnight sensations. arjun is secretly in love with priya which he doesn't want to reveal till he achieves his goal. arjun then brings his childhood friend manjit khosla aka mannu (salman khan), a carefree flirtatious guy who has got no ambitions in life, to join their band. mannu is a trained musician and a real talent for whom later arjun become envious for mannu's superior skills and his affair with priya. arjun with the help of zoheb plans to blight mannu. what happens next forms the rest of the movies.  coming to the technical aspects, we feel only the shadow of vipul amritlal sha whom we have admired in namaste london. felt like he simply visualized the screenplay. to cut it short, a glorified cameraman. screenplay by suresh nair dulls even though it has its moments. defined in a predictable fashion, the screenplay bore you to stiff. camera work was awesome in capturing the beauty of london. it's the only entertaining part while watching songs.  few songs are hummable while others are passable noisy fare. ajay was the one who stole the show with his negative character. salman is monotonous and he irks you. asin is forgettable and i don't that she will make it big in bollywood. aditya roy is impressive while ranvijay is strictly ok. brinda as the bitch is what we have seen in innumerable movies. ompuri is ongoing with the proceedings. i don't want to pen down about the flaws as it will be a herculean task.  finally let me put it simple and straight, london dreams is a soulless movie which you may better enjoy on dvd.",0
"  when i first started watching this movie last night on cinemax, i was shocked that it had been made. cruel intentions, in my opinion, was one of the best teen-oriented films made in years. this prequel had certain things incongruent with the original. (sebastian's father married into wealth, then why does he have a rich aunt on long island?)  then i found out today that it was not really intended to be a new movie, but rather a television series, manchester prep. after hearing that, it made sense to me that it wasn't the same as the movie, just as buffy the vampire slayer is different in tv form.   i think that roger kumble most likely added the ending that this movie had, after the series wasn't picked up by fox. it just seems like something that would happen too fast (sebastian becoming the male version of katharyn) and i just don't know where they would go with the next episode, since it wouldn't be leading to the 1999 film (which the newer ending is directed right towards.)  one thing i didn't like was that it suggested sebastian and his father had married into the wealth, which isn't typically looked good upon in this area of new york, and sine katharyn's mother was just an adult version of her, it didn't seem like something a woman in her position would do, marry a man not of her social class.   as a prequel this is fairly lame. but i would have been interested to see where this had gone as a series.",0
"it's funny how your life can change in a second... to attend ''the waterdance'' for the first time it was an unforgettable experience, the way you need to get used to a new way of life it can seem frightening, and to notice that there are other people going by a similar situation it can help you to go on.   eric stoltz's performances and mainly of helen hunt (oh man!, helen is the purest and graceful woman in earth...) are wonderful, wesley snipes also surprises in one of your last serious roles. a film simple and at the same time deep that doesn't get to leave us indifferent to the message that is transmitted: enjoy each moment of your life...  really to a film as that the any hour is not attended!!!

"indian summer is a warm, multi-character film, that would make a fine afternoon film (with a bit of editing).  the film begins in the past with a group of children being shown a moose, which sets the tone perfectly before cutting into the present, when a group of adults from the ""golden age"" of the camp are invited back again to spend a few weeks holiday by the head of the camp, uncle lou. the film then allows the viewer to spend time with these characters as they remember their times at the camp, and form new memories in their latest stay.  the film succeeds in the great way it brings across its characters in this gorgeous setting, and allows them room to develop without having to worry about plot developments. watching these people reminisce, and their relationships with each other is what the film is all about and why it works so well. it never goes to over the top and melodramatic, always keeping its warmth, charm and realism. i've never seen a film where nostalgia is captured so well, and found myself getting drawn in despite never having been to one of these camps as a child myself.  for a warm, nostalgic character movie, i sincerely recommend.",1
"contains spoilers the movie plot can be summarized in a few sentences: three guys go hunting in the forest. two of them along other people get shot in the head without explanation. the last guy can stand in the clear, shout and do anything without getting shot. he gets to walk through an old factory and has the evil people walk right into his scope without a struggle. the villains are conveniently dressed in black and look like villains.  that is the whole story, not summarized but in detail. everything is drawn out with a guy standing ringing a door bell. we wait with him. long shot of guys being bored in the woods and sleeping. we can take a nap with them. the one drawn out shot of following a female jogger could have been redeeming, if we could see her butt or boobs bouncing.  there dialog is less then terminator and it is not because there is so much action. the characters just don't talk. and, then they don't even have something corny to say like 'i'll be back.' if my buddy shot this on the weekend, i'd cheer for him, because it is quite a feat to figure out the camera controls. to pay money to rent this as a dvd is totally inappropriate.  the one thing that is a little funny is the extra with the director telling, how they local police didn't realize that they were shooting and treated them like a random guy walking around with a gun. if they'd have filmed that, i'd be sure it would be more fun to watch then the movie.",0
"this movie is a true reflection of the australian resourcefulness that has been required to make this country what it is over the last 200 years. not pompous like the british, not gung-ho like the americans. if either of those countries had attempted what this crew did, it would have failed dismally. either due to ignorance on the british part, or too much faith in superior firepower on the american side.

"the world of the 1973 sci-fi drama soylent green is what we could be seeing if we aren't careful. it is a world in which new york city's population has topped the 40 million mark in the year 2022. overpopulation, air pollution, year-long heat waves, and food shortages are the rule. the only hope comes from a food product called soylent green. but what is this particular food stuff really made of? that question is at the heart of this admittedly somewhat dated but still intriguing film, based on harry harrison's 1966 novel ""make room! make room!"" charlton heston stars as thorne, an nypd detective who comes across the murder of a top corporate executive (joseph cotten). as it turns out, cotten was on the board of directors of the soylent corporation, the people responsible for all those food stuffs that the people have to consume in lieu of the real thing. heston believes that this wasn't just a garden-variety murder, that cotten was bumped off for a reason. he gets a lot of help from his slightly cantankerous but very astute ""book"" (edward g. robinson, in his 101st and final cinematic appearance), and a few timely reminders of what the world used to be like. what robinson finds out about soylent green shocks him beyond all imagination; but before he can tell heston all of what he knows, he has himself euthanized. and when heston does indeed find out the secret of soylent green...well, that part has become immortalized into cinematic history.  under the very professional guiding hand of director richard fleischer (the boston strangler; fantastic voyage), soylent green is a fairly grim but thought-provoking look at a dystopian future that humanity might be living if we don't curb our tendency to strip our planet of its natural resources. indeed, this was a project that heston himself had had in mind for filming as far back as 1968, after he had struck gold in the sci-fi genre with planet of the apes--a fact that probably gets lost whenever his ultra-conservative political philosophy comes up in conversation (after all, soylent green is hardly a tract for unrestrained capitalism). robinson, as always, is the consummate professional in his last role; the sequence where he is euthanized (as he looks at video of the world from a better era, set to the music of tchaikovsky, beethoven, and grieg) is quite simply heartbreaking. the film also benefits from solid supporting help from chuck connors (as a very convincing heavy), brock peters (as heston's superior), and leigh taylor-young as the woman who tries to help heston in his inquiries.  it must seem easy these days to dismiss soylent green for being dated. but those who do it ought to think twice; for this film's world may end up becoming ours in actuality if we don't watch what we do with what we have today.",1

"never even knew this movie existed until i found an old vhs copy of it, hidden deep in my dusty horror closet. the title on the box said ""insect"" and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80's horror movie. they can surely be fun, of course, as long as don't expect an intelligent scenario and as long as you're not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy make-up effects. just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in ""blue monkey""! the plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal, the acting performances are painful to observe and there's a total lack of suspense. following the always-popular trend of ""big-bug"" movies, ""blue monkey"" handles about a new and unknown insect species that wipes out the doctors and patients of a remote hospital. the makers couldn't be more evasive about the actual origin of this gigantically over-sized critter! all we know is that it's not from outer space and it initially crawled out of a tropical plant. other than this, there's absolutely no explanation for where this new type of insect all of a sudden comes from! like i said, don't get your hopes up for an intelligent screenplay. the first half of the film is entertaining enough, with some nice gore and the introduction of a couple deranged characters (an 80-year-old blind and alcoholic lady!) but the second half (when the entire hospital is put to quarantine) is dreadfully boring. it is also near the end that ""blue monkey"" begins to exaggeratedly rip-off older (and better) films. approaching the climax, they apparently ran out of budget as well, since the lighting becomes very poor and the guy in the monster suit isn't very well camouflaged anymore. ""blue monkey"" is worth a peek in case you're really bored or if you really want to see every 80's horror movie ever made. fans of b-cinema may recognize john vernon (""killer klowns from outer space"", ""curtains"") in the small and meaningless role of roger, who's in charge of the clinic.",0

"you know the people in the movie are in for it when king-sized hailstones fall from a clear blue sky. in fact, the weather stays pretty bad throughout this atmospheric thriller, and only lawyer chamberlain has the answer. but he's too much the european rationalist, i gather, to get in touch with that inner being that only reveals itself through dreams.  darkly original mystery heavy on the metaphysics from director-writer peter weir. already he had proved his skill at flirting with other dimensions in picnic at hanging rock (1975). here it's the arcane world of the australian aborigines that confronts that the tightly ordered world of the predominant whites. something strange is going on inside the aborigine community when they kill one of their number for no apparent reason. yuppie lawyer chamberlain is supposed to defend them in a white man's court. but the more he looks into things, the more mysterious things get, and the more interested a strange old aboriginal man gets in him. and then there're those scary dreams that come and go at odd times.  well structured screenplay deepens interest throughout. one reason the movie works is the background normalcy of chamberlain's wife and little daughters. audiences can readily identify with them. and when their little world runs into forces beyond the usual framework, the normalcy begins to buckle, and we get the feeling of worlds beginning to collide. chamberlain underplays throughout, especially during the underground discovery tour where i think he should have shown more growing awareness than he does. after all, it's the picking up of the mask that holds the key (i believe) to the riddle, yet his reaction doesn't really register the revelation.   of course, the notion of nature striking back has a certain resonance now, thirty years later. in the film, the notion is wrapped in a lot of entertaining hocus-pocus, but the subject itself remains a telling one. one way of bringing out a central irony in the movie is the symbolism of the opening scene. a big white suv barrels past an aboriginal family, leaving them in the historical dust. the terrain looks like an interior tribal reservation of no particular importance to the coastal fleshpots where industry dwells. yet, it's also a region most likely to survive anything like a destructive last wave. perhaps there's something about past and future to think about here.  anyway, this is a really good movie that will probably stay with you.",1
"though this may not necessarily be a so-called ""classic"" film by today's standards, it's still worth seeing. the main reason why is because after experiencing this film, you get the feeling that you've also experienced the counter-cultural idealism of the 60's, no matter however good or bad.  i happened to see this film in an english literature class at suny geneseo, and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60's icons, the film is far from being simply ""thrown together"".  my point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused, the film has done it's job: it's conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry. it was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplified.  as such, ""zabriskie point"" may not tell a very good (or interesting) story, and at the same time its characters may be one-sided and predictable. however, it also conveys so well this sort of clichéd, rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both mark and daria must share. even the anti-establishment students are as inauthentic as the gov't they rebel against.",1
"the cast of this film contain some of new zealander's better actors, many of who i have seen in fabulous roles, this film however fills me with a deep shame just to be from the same country as them. the fake american accents are the first clue that things are about to go spectacularly wrong. as another review rather astutely noted the luxury cruise ship is in fact an old car ferry, decorated with a few of the multi colour flags stolen from a used car lot. most of the cast appear to be from the (great) long running new zealand soap shortland street. it's as if this movie was dreamt up at a shortland street cast christmas party, the result of too many gins, and possibly a bit of salmonella. imagine ""under siege"" meets ""the love boat"", staged by your local primary school and directed by an autistic and you get the idea.  if you are an actor, i recommend you see this film, as a study on how to destroy your carer.",0
"during the opening night of the vanties a woman is found dead on the catwalk above the stage. as the show continues the police attempt to piece together who killed who and why before the final curtain.  i had always heard that this was a great classic comedy mystery so i was excited to find myself a copy. unfortunately no one told me about the musical numbers which go on and on and on. while the numbers certainly are the type that hollywood did in their glory days, they become intrusive because they pretty much stop the movie dead despite attempts to weave action around them. this wouldn't be so bad if the music was half way decent, but its not. there is only one good song. worse its as if the studio knew they had one song, cocktails for two, and we're forced to endure four versions of it: a duet, a big production number, as the vanities finale and in the background as incidental music. i don't think spike jones and his city slickers ever played it that much. the rest of the movie is pretty good with victor mclaglen sparring nicely with jack oakie. charles middleton is very funny is his scenes as an actor in love with the wardrobe mistress.  by no mean essential i can recommend this if you think you can get through the musical numbers, or are willing to scan through them. its a fun movie of the sort they don't make any more.",1
"""unhinged"" is one strange little film, a forgotten slasher from the golden age of the genre. it's hard to really write a satisfying review of this film simply because of the fact that the film is so unique. it's plot is fairly overdone--three young women on their way to a rock concert get in a car crash and end up stranded at the mansion of an eccentric old woman and her spinster daughter. very quickly, the ladies realize something is not quite right when they hear strange breathing and noises from the attic. on top of that, the mother and daughter seem to have a very, very strange relationship, as they quarrel intensely in front of their houseguest at dinner. the old mother even goes as far as calling her daughter a whore and slut and accuses her of sneaking guys in at night to sleep with them. halfway through the film, when one girl finally decides she better wander off to find help, the killing begins.   as far as the acting goes, this film is at the bottom of the barrel. none of the three stranded girls can act, particularly the ""lead"" girl. it is almost unbelievable to hear them deliver their lines in the same, wooden tone throughout the film. the mother and daughter are better, but not much. the film is also quite dull in parts and really, really drags. the killings are gruesome, but nothing we haven't seen before. however, as mentioned on here, the film really gains points with it brilliantly disturbing and gory ending. it comes totally from left field and has the same shock value as the ending the the camp classic ""sleepaway camp."" unfortunately, the rest of the film is a bore and suffers from horrendous acting and boring, boring pacing. the isolated, creepy looking mansion and the dark, foreboding lighting does give the film a grainy realism, but that is quickly shattered when one of the characters attempts to act. it may be worth it if you can stick it out until the end, but i say you are better off just fast forwarding to the last 10 minutes. 4 out 10",0

"every once in a long while a movie will come along that will be so awful that i feel compelled to warn people. if i labor all my days and i can save but one soul from watching this movie, how great will be my joy.  where to begin my discussion of pain. for starters, there was a musical montage every five minutes. there was no character development. every character was a stereotype. we had swearing guy, fat guy who eats donuts, goofy foreign guy, etc. the script felt as if it were being written as the movie was being shot. the production value was so incredibly low that it felt like i was watching a junior high video presentation. have the directors, producers, etc. ever even seen a movie before? halestorm is getting worse and worse with every new entry. the concept for this movie sounded so funny. how could you go wrong with gary coleman and a handful of somewhat legitimate actors. but trust me when i say this, things went wrong, very wrong.",0

"this movie is one long chiche after another. first of all, though they did their share, there is a unwarranted dope scene where john sniffs weed like an idiot. the wigs and accents are terrible. they sound worse then the old beatle cartoons. john is the nasty, envious, closet homosexual, slave to yoko he is portrayed as being in the discredited albert goldman book. they even keep spouting song titles in regular conversation ""it was always just the two of us""! john would not have been mean to his fans like this either. like his death showed us he was too nice if anything. the one funny scene is where a dumb beatle fan only recognizes john and asks him to sing paul's yesterday. an insulted john says something along the lines of ""sure and while i croon why don't you get down on your knees, put on your wife's wig, and lick my liggin"". that made me laugh for days. really this movie is funny in how serious it tries to be while coming off ridiculous. john and paul also did not sit pontificating all day, they were funny light hearted guys who even during the beatles break up where far more personable then portrayed here. forget it.",0

"everybody knows that gregory widen's original ""the prophecy"" didn't really require a sequel, but you also don't need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cash-ins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable. part two is a very prototypic example of a straight-to-video sequel, meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action, more witty one-liners and a lot more eerie religious scenery. the only good news is that the producers managed to keep christopher walken for the role of gabriel, and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental. if it wasn't for walken's performance (and perhaps a couple of players in the supportive cast like brittany murphy and glenn danzig), ""the prophecy ii"" surely would have disappeared into oblivion straight after its release. the movie begins with gabriel literally getting spat out of hell to proceed with his ongoing war of heaven here on earth. the purpose of his battle this time is to prevent the baby of nurse valerie rosales (jennifer beals) from getting born. for you see, her unborn child is the first ever hybrid between a heavenly angel and an earthly ""monkey"" and the birth of such a superior being would imply the downfall of gabriel's evil dominion. thus, just as in the first movie, he engages a suicidal accomplice to assist him and hunts valerie all the way down to the eden for the final showdown. ""the prophecy ii"" is an endurable and occasionally even entertaining movie as long as you don't make comparisons with the original and as long as you manage to overlook the multiple plot holes and errors in continuity. whenever the storyline becomes too tedious, the makers luckily enough always insert a near-brilliant christopher walken moment to distract you. his interactions with the rebellious izzy and particularly his ignorance regarding modern earthly technologies often result in worthwhile and memorable sequences. on a slightly off-topic note, i often felt like ""the prophecy ii"" ambitions to look similar to ""terminator ii""  gabriel's resurrection looked somewhat like the teleportation of a futuristic cyborg and the eden location, where the final battle takes place, looks very similar to the steel factory where ""terminator ii"" ended as well. coincidence, i guess? overall, this is an inferior and passable sequel but still worth checking out in case you're a fan of christopher walken's unique acting charisma (and who isn't?).",0
"imagine the scenario - you are at the movie theater only because you are in washington for the weekend and it's raining and you're finished with the museums. you think you might go see the sarah marshall movie as the trailer look so so and you don't have to engage your brain. it's sold out. options? - the bank job, in bruges, the leatherheads or prom night. you've seen the bank job (suprisingly decent heist movie that) and in bruges (again, pretty good) so you're down to two. you don't fancy watching clooney or the nice one from the office run around in 1930 football uniforms, so you go see prom night right? wrong. you take the $8.50, walk up to a stranger in the street and ask him to punch you in the face for $8.50. it would be money better spent.  it actually plays like more of a comedy than a horror/thriller or whatever it is supposed to be. if i was financing that movie and they showed me that as a final cut i wouldn't know whether to laugh or cry. probably both. an insult to anyone's intelligence... my roommate was laughing out loud most of the movie, as for the acting, they might as well have cast robots (or maybe dogs) in the roles, they would have been more realistic. the detective has to be possibly the worst actor i have ever seen (ben affleck and hayden christansan (i hate his acting so much i don't care how you spell his name) you are relieved on your title(s))   so in summary 'not good'",0

"""and the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom"" - anais nin marcel proust says, ""the real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes."" author and screenwriter antwone fisher joined the u.s. navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes. based on his autobiography ""finding fish"" written many years after the events, his story is dramatized in the film antwone fisher, denzel washington's first directorial effort. it is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by one's past to being able to live life in present time.  required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base, the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up antwone (derek luke) recounts his life in sessions with navy psychiatrist jerome davenport (denzel washington). he is at first unwilling to talk, but when he begins, the floodgates are opened. after his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison, he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years, suffering humiliation and sexual abuse. according to antwone, the treatment by his foster mother mrs. tate (novella nelson) who referred to him only as ""nigga"" and by his cousin nadine (yolonda ross) was in fact much worse than shown on the screen.  the only friend he has is a local by named jesse (jascha washington) who, later in the film, only adds to his feelings of abandonment. it is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in ordinary people and good will hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of washington and luke, though the film's attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile. davenport's humanity and warmth, however, allows fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and cheryl (joy bryant), his new girlfriend who is also in the navy, supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthrough.  with cheryl's help and dr. davenport's counseling, antwone develops enough self-esteem to return to cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past. what comes through in derek luke's incredible performance is antwone's longing for acceptance, dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him. comedian mort sahl once said that ""people just have to remember what we're all here for: to find our way home..."" antwone fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep, not knowing the joy of being loved.",1

"i'm not usually one to slate a film . i try to see the good points and not focus on the bad ones, but in this case, there are almost no good points. in my opinion, if you're going to make something that bad, why bother? part of the film is take up with shots of anne's face while she breaths deeply, and violin music plays in the background. the other part is filled with poor and wooden acting. rupert penry jones is expressionless. jennifer higham plays anne's younger sister with modern mannerisms. anne is portrayed as being meek and self effacing, which is fine at the beginning, but she stays the same all through the film, and you see no reason for captain wentworth to fall in love with her. overall the production lacks any sense of period, with too many mistakes to be overlooked, such as running out of the concert, kissing in the street, running about in the streets with no hat on (why was this scene in the film at all? the scene in the book was one of the most romantic scenes written.). to sum it up, a terrible film, very disappointing.",0
"a little girl lives with her father and brother in the middle of the countryside. this little girl rosalie has some psychotic tendencies as the movie opens with her feeding kittens to some kind of creatures in the cemetery, and she has recently lost her mother who went crazy but whilst alive enjoyed staying in the woods all night. the premise of the film has a new young lady coming to rosalie to take care of her. she is introduced to the evil of the woods while driving and, imagine the suspense here, experiences a huge blue barrel falling over the side of a cliff to somehow stop her car dead in its tracks. from there she walks to the nearest house and discovers mrs. whitfield who then goes into a whole lot of explanation about rosalie and her family. the earnestness exuded by the mrs. whitfield character has to be seen to be believed. well, the young lady meets up with the child and we soon learn that not only is she strange but everyone in the film is very bizarre as well. they all do share one thing in common which is none of them ever heard of an acting school. none of these people can act - as evidenced by the few vehicles any of them in the entire film appeared in before or since - and all of them look like they have little idea what is going on, pause to remember lines, and have all the conviction of a paper bag. the director plods through the material in a slow pace with this horrible piano music crescendoing here and there at things that are suppose to be scary. it takes us a bit before we get to a couple of murders by the creature friends, but by that time i didn't care. the murders are not convincing either, and truth be told the whole film looks like someone through it together on their friend's farm with the people and things on hand there. that all being said the ending does have some creepy aspects to it though we don't learn one darn thing about why rosalie is like this or more importantly who the creature with the cheap masks are. cheap doesn't even begin to describe the budget here with. it basically is a couple old farmhouses and some sheds at the end and of course the woods. someone lent the director a couple old cars too. no special effects of any kind and only the most minimal make-up. there are so many guffaws/ridiculous moments to list, but i will just list a few here that at the very least made me chuckle from the lack of aptitude from the creative powers involved: 1)watch the gardener's body well after he has been ""slain"". len comes in and sees him butchered and you can see his fat belly heave with life. 2)the dying scene at the end where the actress playing rosalie is killed. she looks like she is listening to directions and takes her sweet time dying considering the method. 3)how about the guy playing roaslie's father giving us a cranky poor man's andy griffith. the scene where he is laughing about boy scouts dying was a weird hoot. the child is indeed a very bad film and is very bad even for the standards of 70's cheese if you will. this isn't a b film but more like a z film with producer harry novak making some money on virtually nothing.",0

"for a fan series, i must admit that hidden frontier is not at all that bad. but, reviewing this series can not be based on whether it is a fan series or not. the initiative in itself is commendable. the creativity as well. i reckon these are people with ordinary jobs, and a big enthusiastic heart for star trek. but, doing all this work. pulling all these resources. taking all this time, and still all those flaws.  first of all the acting, and the lines are awful. for most. the dialogs belongs in a 70's military show, not in star trek. the captain (mr squinty) looks like he is about to burst into laughter anytime. and most characters are just reading their lines. the directors should be aware of the fact that ""retake"" is not just a word in the dictionary. but i also guess that the series are made in the manner of ""two takes frakes"", who directed many of the tng episodes and movies also, i could not help but think that most of the actors are typical trekkies. without going any deeper into that assumption.  my biggest concern regarding the whole project, is the quality of the releases. when they first decided to spend so much time, and resources on this series - why didn't they make it available in decent quality? using the quick time format, with low low resolution is a waste of talent. even the ""higres"" episodes is considered bad quality compared to the standard quality series are released in. using xvid codec, with a larger resolution and file size would have improved the experience massively. if band with problems was the issue, setting up a torrent tracker would have solved that.  let's hope the crew decides to brush the series up, and perhaps release it on dvd, giving it the quality the project deserves.",0

"star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning   ray (ray winstone) has a criminal past, has had problems with alcohol and is now forming a drug habit that is making him paranoid and prone to domestic violence to his wife valerie (kathy burke) who tries to hold the family together but ends up coming off more like a doormat. meanwhile, her mother janet (laila morse) is aware of ray's son, billy (charlie creed-miles) and his escalating drug habit that is sending him off the rails. the film follows these despairable characters as they tredge along with their lives.  it is said that the british seem to enjoy being miserable, and that would include watching films that entertain them this way. films like nil by mouth highlight this. it's a tale of a broken family, torn apart by crime, poverty, booze and drugs, the kind jeremy kyle would lap up like a three course meal. it is also essentially a tale of self destructive men, three generations apart and each copying the other, tearing a family apart and women trying to hold it together, despite not being strong enough. if you pick up a little of what it's about from the off-set, you can see it doesn't promise to be cheerful viewing from the start and it certainly doesn't disappoint in this.  it's true what everyone said about the performances, and the lead stars, winstone and burke, do deliver some great acting. we see winstone lose it with his wife, beating her senseless after some more coke induced paranoia, breaking down during a phone conversation with her and unleashing a typical arsenal of f and c words when she refuses to let him see his kid. likewise, in a private moment, we see burke skillfully lose her composure on a staircase, the full impact of the night before kicking in.  this is another of those films where there's no 'plot' to follow, as such, just a real life feel of these hopeless lives carrying on from one day to the next. it's been acclaimed by many (including the baftas!) but it really was just too grim and bleak for me. i have no right to criticize it for this, knowing what i knew about it from the off-set, but sadly this is how i found it. **",0

"i am commenting on this miniseries from the perspective of someone who read the novel first. and from that perspective i can honestly say that while enjoyable, i can see why it hasn't been rebroadcast anytime recently. more specifically, this mini has some serious problems, such as:  1) it is terribly miscast. the actors who played the younger generation were all 15 to 20 years older than the characters. ali mcgraw (45 at the time) was playing natalie jastrow who was supposed to be about 26. jan-michael vincent (39 at the time) was playing byron henry who was supposed to be about 22. the other henry children, and pamela tudsbury, were also played by actors way too old for characters who were supposed to be in their 20's.  2) some of the acting was absolutely awful. ali mcgraw at times almost made this mini unwatchable. i have seen more convincing performances in high school plays.   3) the directing was poor. to be fair to ali mcgraw, the bad acting and character development were probably the directing. the portrayal of hitler was way overdone. his character came off looking and behaving more like a cartoon villain than the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always diabolical genius herman wouk painted him as in the novel. some of the other characters are done so stereotypically (berel jastrow) they do not gain the depth of character that wouk created for them.  4) this mini is very dated. the hokey music, the pretentious narration (it sounded like a junior high school history film narration), and the entire prime-time soap opera feel of the mini made it almost comical at times. also, too often byron and natalie are costumed and made up to look like they are in 1979 rather than 1939.  someone who watches this without the benefit of reading the novel first will probably not sit through it all, because it will come off more as a late 70's / early 80's ""take myself too seriously"" prime-time soap drama, rather than the television version of what is certainly a modern american classic.  remakes of older movies and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably one case where a creative and inspired director could make a very stunning, memorable, and critically acclaimed production. i don't ever see that happening since a remake would have to be just as long (15 hours) or longer to do it right, and given the short attention span of most of the current american viewing public, it wouldn't fly.",0
"sometimes a movie is so comprehensively awful it has a destructive effect on your morale. you begin to really ask yourself, what does it mean for our society that the standard is so terribly low? can they honestly expect that we'll endure this many clichés and still be entertained?  of course, it is still a hollywood mainstay to make the gun the major character, plot device, and the source of all conflict and resolution in films. character needs a gun. gets a gun. can't do that because he has a gun. puts his gun down first. oh my god what are we going to do!? he has a gun! he waves it around, acting more malicious than real human beings ever do. he pushes it in someone's face for 90 minutes, shouting questions. the hallmark of any conclusion will be the comforting sound of police sirens.   it's a real challenge to make such a tired, hackneyed formula work again; a film has to be very clever and well executed. this one is neither. it has no life and no personality, and it will suck these components from you. it will make you feel worse about living in the time and space that you do. really, who needs that!? so yes, i'll say it: i think this may well be the worst film i have ever seen. anyone who was involved in the making of this sub- mediocre soul killing trash should be publicly embarrassed for the disservice they've done to us all.",0
"""opening night"" released in 1977, tries to be an ambitious production. it succeeds only in the truly stunning performance of gena rowlands. her character of theatre actress myrtle is not necessarily someone we would love in real life. she is self-absorbed, often obnoxious, and makes life miserable for those around her - in other words, not unlike some actresses! myrtle is also a woman on the edge of collapse - we are not quite sure if the demons she is fighting are real or imagined, although we are let in on the secret early. rowlands is obviously well directed with love by her gifted husband, actor/director john cassavettes, who has a role in the film as well. this film is not without flaws - it is overly long, and the last part of the film where myrtle goes on stage while very drunk seems almost cruel. the ""improvising"" in some of the dialogue - at least while on stage - goes on way too long. some of the supporting characters give good performances, especially from ben gazarra, playing myrtle's sleazy producer. joan blondell's character is never fully developed, and i never could figure out why she was in the film, except to placate myrtle. see this film for rowlands alone - she is fascinating throughout - and it is tough to take your eyes off her, although you will want to at times.",1
"whatever rating i give boom is only because of the superb location photography of sardinia and rome. otherwise, this is only for hardcore addicts of elizabeth taylor (her downward phase), and richard burton (his miscasting phase). tennessee williams wrote ""the milk train doesn't stop here anymore"" and is supposed to be very fond of this adaptation of his play--but apparently, he was the only one. taylor reportedly hated it and burton needed the money.  whatever, it amounts to a hill of beans with taylor posturing and fuming in her shrill manner, exploding at the servants and exchanging bad baby-talk with no less than noel coward who seems to be a visitor from another film when he finally appears.  it's so campy that among taylor fans it's probably considered a ""must see"" kind of thing. but if you can sit through this one without a drink in your hand, you're way ahead of me. sadly, this is the film that signified the end of taylor being taken seriously as a film actress, even after winning two oscars. for burton, it was equally disastrous and the critics called it a bomb. judge for yourself if you dare.",0
"never before has a film driven me to write a review but this was just dire.i stuck with it trying to find what it was about this film that made snoop pick it as his first serious role but frankly it was a poor choice.maybe this made a good book but it certainly did not work for me as a film.i found it unbelievable,lacking atmosphere and i found many of the scenes hideously stilted.a musical maestro he may be but a serious actor snoop ain't.the acting by dylan mcdermott and rose byrne was passable but not enough to carry a weak plot with feeble dialogue. perhaps i have just entirely missed the point but to me it didn't fit into any genre,it didn't elicit any empathy with the characters nor did it create any suspense,in fact i found myself praying for the end and quelling a deep desire to slap all three of the main characters!",0
"ok, so soldier isn't deep and meaningful like blade runner or as big budget as terminator 2 but on the whole i found it quite enjoyable.  the fact that kurt russell stayed in character not speaking and being virtually emotionless made the moments when his humanity broke through all the more poignant. i found his portrayal of restricted emotional development more touching than arnie's in the t films (and before i get comments yes i know that arnie was a cyborg and kurt was human but the premise put forward by both films was the same).  so to the film itself, a reasonable us/brit cast are able to flesh out this little story. not really sure if gary busey and his two deputies were baddies or goodies, so was unable to decide whether i liked them or not. the colony was a little more realistic neither a misguided bunch of peace loving/gullible/cowardly hicks who get wiped out from the get go nor a group of subversive aggressive terrorists paranoid about offworlders and each other.  kurt russell is good and unlike other comments i do not feel this will have a negative impact on his career (unlike maybe escape from la - sequels are such fickle creatures!). sean pertwee has really done his late father proud by continuing the families noble sci-fi lineage. and the rest of the cast helped flesh out this pathetic band of people making the most of a bad situation and not doing too badly.  if you see this on your tv schedule i would recommend giving it a chance. i don't think you will be disappointed.",1
"ok so i hear about this new justin timberlake movie coming out which features some pretty big names. i mean great actors like, the freeman aka morgan freeman, an asset to hollywood, however completely wasted in this film. then we got kevin spacey, who i've been a great fan of ever since i watched american beauty and the usual suspects. both of these great actors probably signed on to the movie thinking it was going to be a great movie as i did when i heard the story. then enter a fresh faced justin timberlake. i say fresh faced because this is his first movie and those rotten tomatoes haven't hit him yet. well the reason for that , i might add, is because no one will ever see this movie or even bother reading this review. the movie is so terrible that when i got into the first 15 minutes of it. the characters were so one dimensional that it makes some bible characters look like the don corleone. they got the one liners and sound-bite worthy stuff. the token troubled black guy (ll cool j) who is with a gorgeous woman who he otherwise would not even belong with in real life. the captain is this short whiny guy who speaks in such a high tone. and what crappy movie would be complete without the hero becoming richer because of an experience. oh and lots of gun fire, i mean a whole lot. spoiler(not!!!) the kind of gun fire that leaves everyone in the police force who's crooked dead and the hero prevails. they got flame throwers and rocket launchers, really no kidding.  bottom line if you want to see edison its because you are a great fan of one of the actors, or a great fan of justin timberlake, to all the 13 year old girls out there, enjoy!! i wish i had more hands, because then i would have more thumbs, because this movie is so terrible because then i could give it so many thumbs down that thumbs down would no longer mean anything because this movie is so terrible because it sucks so badly that it made me laugh out of frustration about the story line because it just would not end because the firing and yelling just kept happening.  may g*d have mercy on us all and save us from these terrible movies. well it could be worst, another rnb terrible actor turned singer turned terrible actor is usher, hehe check out in the mix lol, or even get rich or die trying'. now the special thing about that movie is that its got 30+ year old men, playing 16 or even younger teens. i could go on with these.",0
"""anchors aweigh"" is the product of the classic mgm musical production unit, and on the whole the film is every enjoyable  good music by jule styne and others, excellent dancing by gene kelly (and even a passable job by frank sinatra), and a funny well-paced script. the only major element i would criticize would be the casting of kathryn grayson, whose presence in a film always means the audience will be subjected to endless pseudo-operatic warbling from the petite miss.  kelly plays a naval serviceman named joseph brady, a man with a mythic reputation around the ship as a lover but whose valentino-charms are constantly being subdued by the presence of his less cocksure friend with the improbable middle-american name of clarence (sinatra). upon receiving 3 days of shore leave for saving clarence's life, joe reluctantly agrees to help clarence find a girl based on the dubious premise that he owes him something for saving his life. they are drafted by a policeman (rags ragland), who needs them to help coax a precocious young boy (dean stockwell) who wants to join the navy into returning home to ""aunt susan"" (grayson). at first it is clarence who is interested in wooing ""aunt susan"" but eventually kelly's character emerges as the more likely candidate.  there are several standout musical scenes but nothing to come close to kelly's more famous work in films like ""singin' in the rain"" and ""american in paris"". the closest we get is a gimmicky sequence with kelly's character in a fantasy sequence dancing with jerry, the mouse from ""tom and jerry"" (although he seems to be closer in size to a dog or cat here than to a mouse). it's a startling sequence for its time but doesn't have enough complexity or emotion to really stand the test of time. i actually enjoyed the parts of the sequence that took place prior to the animation, where kelly was using semi-balletic moves to emphasize the transition into the fantasy world and where we see him dance down a tunnel that looks like something right out of ""alice in wonderland"".  eventually the characters find their way to susan's favorite bar, a somewhat sanitized mexican restaurant/bar in tijuana. there the patrons happily allow ms. grayson to chirp her arias with abandon, and the management becomes very excited at the opportunity that clarence and joe have extended for her to sing with their ""friend"" jose iturbi (playing himself with a light humorous touch). of course they've never met their ""friend"" iturbi and they spend much of the film's length trying to reach him (in an amusing scene sinatra's character meets iturbi but mistakes him for a piano tuner and urges him to abandon tuning pianos and try a professional career), sneaking into the studio and the hollywood bowl, where iturbi is rehearsing a surreal symphony comprised of dozens of young piano players  you haven't seen anything like this outside of ""1000 fingers of dr. t"". iturbi himself is a kind of a god-figure in the story  he represents the opportunity for salvation from the drudgery of unfulfilling work and the possibility for fame and artistic achievement for the heroine. everyone is 100% sure that as soon as mr. iturbi so much as hears ms. grayson, her operatic career will be a reality. the 3 primary characters are desperate to reach him and they think of him as some kind of remote and distant mythological figure  a lot of the film's charm and humor comes from the contrast of this perception to the very down-to-earth ""real"" mannerisms of the maestro. and speaking of iturbi's contributions to the film, he also provides a very stimulating musical moment with his orchestral interpretation of ""donkey serenade"".  when all is said and done, this is a film that nobody who enjoys musicals will want to miss. the majority of the music was written for this film, a nice contrast to recycled soundtracks for other kelly opuses like ""rain"" and ""american"". kelly is still at his early peak, adventurous and boisterous in both his dances and his interpretation of the character. sinatra's voice was never in better form and he rarely had better songs to sing. stockwell is a charming addition to the clan, and grayson's character is endearing when she isn't posturing on stage. iturbi adds that well-grounded but sophisticated tone that perfectly matches the atmosphere and style of the classic-era mgm musical. this is one of the better ones.",1
"*review may contain spoilers*  predictable, campy, bad special effects. it has a tv-movie feeling to it. the idea of the un as being taken over by satan is an interesting twist to the end of the world according to the bible. the premise is interesting, but its excution falls waaaay short. if you want to convert people to christianity with a film like this, at least make it a quality one! i was seriously checking my watch while watching this piece of dreck. can't say much else about this film since i saw it over a year ago, and there isn't really much to say about this film other than.....skip it!",0

"kazan's early film noir won an oscar. some of the reviews here go into extraordinary detail and length about the film and its symbolism, and rate it very highly. i can almost see where they are coming from. but i prefer to take a more toned-down approach to a long-forgotten film that appears to have been shot on practically no budget and in quasi-documentary fashion. pneumonic plague is loose in the streets of new orleans, and it is up to a military doctor (widmark) and a city detective (douglas) to apprehend the main carrier (palance). the film is moody, shot in stark black and white, and makes very good use of locations. widmark is wonderful as usual. forget the symbolism (crime equals disease, and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the chase. it is not always easy watching a film like this now that we are well into this new century, as it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (post wwii through the early 1950s) and will unlikely be of interest to the casual film watcher. for those who will be watching this for the first time, sit tight for the big chase at the end. it is something else, and frankly i don't know how they filmed some of it. i can say it probably took as long to film the finale as it did the first 90 percent of the movie.",1
"this ranks way up there on my top list of worst movies i've seen so far on starz on demand. they seem to pick up every straight to dvd crap-fest they can find and put it on here.  why? who knows! apparently anyone with a digital camera and a shoestring budget can come up with a horror movie and get it put on tv. to be honest, this looked terrible from the moment i saw the trailer--but i did give it a real chance.  i always try to have an open mind about low-budget movies. some of the best movies i've ever seen were films that worked around their low budget or in other cases only required that low budget to be great.  this is not one of those movies.  you know the plot by now, i'm sure, if you're reading this. either you heard about it on starz on demand or for whatever reason you ended up on this page out of boredom. it's about a pathetic and whiny girl we get to know for all of 3 minutes in an incredibly bad ""heavy metal"" music video. whoever put it together must have thought it looked really interesting, but it really, really doesn't. anyway, she kills herself. then she possesses someone. then some killing starts. it's really unmemorable and as completely average and boring as possible. when the first gunshot goes off in her apartment it quite seriously sounds like a piece of popcorn popping. was that the best sound effect they could come up with? i could find a better sound effect to use for free, (with no copyright,) on the internet... right. now.  don't let the other reviews claiming this is a 10 star movie fool you. they are obviously either distributors of the film or maybe even the director trying to con you into thinking this piece of junk is worth buying.  laughable.",0
"i can't say whether the post-wwii british comedies produced at the ealing studios are an acquired taste or not, but i am completely addicted, and the man in the white suit is one of the best. no need to go into the well-known plot about the threat posed to both the textile industry and the textile unions by an indestructible, dirt-resistant fiber. suffice it to say that the slings and arrows suffered by the naively idealistic sidney stratton in pursuing his polymer vision make for a comedic delight. many of the well-known faces from the world of british character actors - the nervous cecil parker, the suavely devious michael gough, and the bluntly ruthless ernest thesinger - put in wonderful performances. guinness - as always and forever - is superb, and joan greenwood is delectable as daphne (just the way she enunciates the word ""daddy"", makes the entire movie worth seeing).

"i am 17, and i still like most of the scooby doo movies and the old episodes. i love the 1990s movies, and recently we were treated to one of the better direct to dvd scooby doo outings of this decade, scooby doo and the goblin king, which i wasn't expecting to be as good as it was. anyway, back to get a clue! i watched some episodes, expecting something very good, but from what i saw of it, i wasn't impressed at all. first of all, i hated the animation. it was flat, deflated and very saturday- morning -cartoon -standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. even some shows i really hate had slightly better animation. even worse, shaggy and scooby looked like aliens, and i really missed fred, velma and daphne, as they added a lot to the old episodes, when scooby doo was positively good. i also hated the character changes, because it seemed like instead of solving mysteries, shaggy and scooby were now playing superhero, something they would've never had done in the movies or in the scooby-doo where are you? show. the theme tune wasn't very good either, i can't even remember it, and the jokes were lame and contrived. though, i do acknowledge that there is a very talented voice cast, had they had better material, and hadn't been told to sound as different to the original voices as humanly possible, which they did, might i add. in conclusion, i personally thought it was awful, and i am not trying to discredit it, it's what i personally feel. 1/10 bethany cox",0
"a really very bad movie, with a very few good moments or qualities.  it starts off with pregnant linda blair, who runs down a hallways to flee what might be monsters or people with pitchforks, i'm not sure. she jumps through a window and wakes up, and we see she is very pregnant. the degree to which she is pregnant varies widely throughout the movie.  she and an annoying and possibly retarded little boy who i thought was her son travel to an abandoned hotel on an island. italian horror directors find the most irritating little boys to put in their movies! on the island already are david hasselhoff and his german-speaking virgin girlfriend (you know how germans are said to love hasselhoff...). he's taking photographs, and she's translating an esoteric german book about witches, i think.  also traveling to the island are an older couple who have purchased it, and a real estate agent, and a woman i thought was their daughter. evidently she was an architect, and linda blair and the boy are the older couple's children. i guess they all traveled to the island together, but it really seemed like linda and the boy were apart from the rest of them (maybe they were filmed separately).  the hotel seems neat, certainly from the exteriors, but it isn't used to any great effect. an old woman in bad makeup and a black cloak keeps appearing to the boy and chants something in german sometimes, which he eventually records on his sesame street tape recorder.  people start getting killed, either in their dreams, or sucked into hell or something. some of these gore scenes are ok, but not enough to recommend the movie. though the copy i watched stated it is uncut on the box cover, the death of one character whose veins explode really seems to have been cut. much of the scene is showing another character's reaction shots, since we're not seeing anything ourselves. the creepiest scene is one in which a man or demon with a really messy-looking wound of a mouth rapes someone. he looked particularly nasty. there's a laughably and painfully bad scene in which linda blair is possessed. i wish if a horror movie is going to cast her, they would do something original with her role, and let her leave exorcist behind her (except for the yearly horror conventions).  in the weird, largely italian, tradition of claiming to be a sequel to something it is unrelated to, this is also aka la casa 4 and ghosthouse 2. that is, it is supposedly a sequel to casa 3 - ghosthouse, la (1988) - it's not (that's also a better movie than this one). la casa 1 and two were the evil dead (1981) and evil dead ii (1987) - again unrelated to witchery and la casa 3 (and much better than those). there's also a casa 5, la (1990) aka house 5, which seems to want to be a sequel to the fake la casa series and the series house: house (1986) house ii: the second story (1987), the horror show (1989) aka house iii, and house iv (1992). how's the horror show fit in there? it doesn't really, it claimed to be a sequel, thus requiring the real series entry to renumber itself to cause less (or more?) confusion. oddly, the horror show is also aka horror house, and la casa 5 is also aka horror house 2. does your head hurt yet?",0
i got this as a turkey movie and was i not disappointed.  acting - overall even though many have been in other movies it is clear that they had to work hard to act this bad so constantly over this entire movie with out accidentally letting slip some degree of acting.  plot - being generous i could say that the scriptwriter did originally start with a plot but but did his best to ignore it. the plot broke down faster then a chinese knock off computer   scrip - now that was an abomination of nature. it failed to flow with any rhyme or reason. the majority of the lines by the characters were at best pathetic to imbecilic. the script worked hard to make sure that no character managed to get to be considered memorable. i have watched other movies where the extras were more interesting and memorable.  special effects - rotflmao!!!!! they were short bus special   directing - until you can come up with your own directing ability copy the style of your favorite directer otherwise you will only make failures like this.  it is good to know that your friends/family have been giving you 10 stars for this movie,0
"cliff robertson as a scheming husband married to a rich wife delivers a razzie-worthy performance here if there ever was one; it's as if director michael anderson kept yelling ""dial it down; think zombie, only less lively"" through his little bullhorn as he coached robertson's effort. the rest of the cast is barely better; jennifer agutter of logan's run fame is hardly seen in what should have been fleshed out as a pivotal role. if the quality of the acting was three times better; if some of the more gaping plot holes were filled; and if the pacing were given a shot of adrenaline, then this yawner might be brought up to a standard acceptable to the hallmark\lifetime tv channel crowd. as is, its rating is so inexplicably high one can't help thinking chronic insomniacs are using dominique to catch a little snoozing time. perhaps the late-night tv telemarketers are missing a major opportunity in not shilling it as such.",0

"i used to love sabrina the teenage witch and have seen every single episode. i remember when i used to sit at 6pm every night and wait for it to come on nickelodeon, however when sabrina left high school the show began to go downhill. the best series has to be when she was friends with valerie (i'm not sure which one that is). from there the next series (friends with dreama) was still really good, but when she left high school it just didn't seem right. all the main characters seemed to have left, which meant that it didn't have as much of the old ""sparkle"", however the first series where sabrina is in college is still relatively good and watchable, however when her aunt's leave and sabrina moves into their house it just isn't right. she is no longer a teenager, so therefore the name of the show isn't right and without hilda and zelda and josh the show just doesn't seem right, especially when sabrina nearly marries someone that isn't harvey. thank goodness he came through in the last five minutes of the last episode to take her away. all in all i still love to watch the old episodes of sabrina the teenage witch, but i think the writers took it too far and should have left it with sabrina leaving high school. because after that the show definitely lost some of it's magic",1
what a shame that alan clarke has to be associated with this tripe. that doesn't rule it out however; get a group of lads and some stellas together and have a whale of a time running this one again and again and rolling around on the floor in tears of laughter. great wasted night stuff. al hunter homes in on a well publicised theme of the late 80s- that hooligans were well organised and not really interested in the football itself- often with respectable jobs (estate agent???). but how clarke can convince us that any of the two-bit actors straying from other tv productions of low quality (grange hill) or soon to go on to poor quality drama (eastenders) can for a nanosecond make us believe that they are tough football thugs is laughable. are we really to believe that the icf (on whom of course the drama is based) would ever go to another town to fight with just six blokes?  the icf would crowd out tube stations and the like with hundreds. andy nicholls' scally needs to be read before even contemplating a story of this nature. the acting is appalling and provides most of the laughs- oldman is so camp it is unbelievable. most of them look as though they should be in a bubble of bath of mr matey. a true inspiration to anyone with a digital video camera who thinks they can make a flick- go for it.,0
"in late 1800s san francisco, poor well-dressed errol flynn (as james j. corbett) works at a bank, and enjoys attending local ""fights"" (boxing) with co-worker and drinking buddy jack carson (as walter lowrie). one day, pretty alexis smith (as victoria ware) walks into the ""comstock bank"", where mr. flynn works. flynn is so taken with ms. smith's elegant beauty, he offers to carry her withdrawal purse. smith is secretly taken with the handsome flynn, but is put off by his brashness.  flynn's good deed (actually, pick-up attempt) gets him a complimentary membership in the snooty ""olympic club"", which conveniently includes a gymnasium (with boxing equipment). however, flynn's presumptuous manner, and practical joking (he tickles men on the parallel bars) irritates ""club"" members. when an english boxing champ visits the club, members endeavor to get flynn to fight the man. they are hopeful flynn will resign, humiliated by his defeat - but, flynn wins!   first time producer robert buckner puts together a nice package for warner brothers, and director raoul walsh. mr. buckner was, certainly, basking in the success of his contribution (screenplay) to the studio's brilliant ""yankee doodle dandy"". unfortunately, this story is positively ludicrous. there was a ""gentleman jim"" - this story is supposedly the filming of the real james j. corbett's autobiography ""the roar of the crowd"" - but, this movie must be significantly fictionalized.  flynn is a very appealing leading man; he maneuvers the script lightly, and should have been recognized, by the early 1940s, as an excellent actor. many of flynn's characterizations were (are?) overlooked as great performances, and this is one of them. smith does well as his feminine interest, deftly transmitting her emotions for the viewer. director walsh makes the silliness look smooth and extravagant. the supporting cast is a treasure trove, from boisterous alan hale (as pat corbett) to walk-on lon mccallister (""paging mr. corbett"").  ******** gentleman jim (1942) raoul walsh ~ errol flynn, alexis smith, alan hale",1
"""who done it?"" contains many surefire laughs and gags. it is not only one of the best stooges films with shemp, it is one of the finest short comedies columbia produced. director bernds originally wrote the screenplay in 1946 for the stooges, but when curly howard suffered a career-ending stroke, it was tailored for the columbia comedy team of schilling and lane (their version was released as ""pardon my terror."") it obviously was too good for the stooges to pass up, and it was finally filmed by the stooges at the end of 1947.  old man goodrich calls ace detectives shemp, larry, and moe out of fear that he will be murdered. when they arrive at his home, goodrich has disappeared, and his niece and assorted goons try to get rid of the stooges. will they find goodrich and bring the niece and goons to justice?   shemp is particularly funny in this film. his reactions after being given a mickey by christine mcintyre are superb; he gives his trademark sound (eeeb-eeeb-eeeb) and miss mcintyre is noticeably trying not to laugh! other funny scenes: the close-up of moe's mug looking through the camera lens; and the in-the-dark fight with all cast members involved.  nikko the goon (played by duke york) is one of the most unusual looking characters ever portrayed in a stooges film. with his kinked hair, he could almost pass for a stooge, if he didn't tower over everyone else! ""who done it?"" is a gem among the stooges films with shemp. even die-hard curly fans will enjoy this one! a true stooge classic. 9 out of 10.",1

"not that ""a film by ulli lommel"" filled me with hope, but i must confess that zodiac killer managed to sink beneath my lowest expectations. there is a recent trend among young filmmakers of utilizing digital video for their early projects, which is all well and good for giving these kids the opportunity to create work without spending all their money on expensive film stock. but many of these young filmmakers have also wised up to the notion of filtering the finished movie so that it appears qualitatively more like celluloid. the effect is never perfect, but it helps. unfiltered digital video really only works for the ""mockumentary"" style, because it never looks like anything other than video. therein lies the primary trouble with zodiac killer. watching the movie feels like watching a daytime soap opera about a murderer. it does not feel like watching a movie. and what's even more unforgivable is that the lommel is not a young filmmaker. he ought to know better. he ought to know that it's virtually impossible to generate horror (or even suspense!) on video. for the love of god this guy has been directing since the sixties! he may be the only director who has failed to improve over a forty year career in the business. and lucky us, he wrote the script too! so you can expect convoluted actions that mean nothing, unjustified behavior, and at least one truly pretentious plot element that will leave you utterly unsatisfied. please, please miss this film. you'll thank me later.",0
"darkly comic serendipity about a cosmetics saleswoman, with odd ties to elvis presley, running into a sea of elvis impersonators while speaking at conventions in nevada...and accidentally killing each one of them through little fault of her own. kim basinger, a still-attractive actress of considerable merit, likes to pick quirky movies to play in, but this dreadful screenplay (by mitchell ganem and adam-michael garber) hasn't an iota of good humor. the stereotypes and low-ball gags are not meant to be the stuff of classic comedy, but even on a shambling, shameful level, the picture is crude and sloppy. if you do watch, see if you can count how much extraneous shots there are of basinger behind the wheel of her pink cadillac, hands always in the same position and a non-plussed look on her face. hopefully both she and elvis were well paid. no stars from ****",0
"i don't normally feel much of an incentive to comment on films i don't like, but in a case like this one, i just have to say something. this movie is terrible, illogical, and stupid. there are so many flaws in the storytelling that i don't even feel obliged to elaborate on because it's time for me to move on from this experience. the most annoying point is, however, that at no point in the film does anyone explain whether the motivations for bacon's character's madness are due to a power trip or a physiological reaction to his condition.  granted the special effects are impressive, and in the past paul verhoeven has done some good stuff (the director's cut of robocop on dvd is great). however, this movie is stupid and generally doesn't come near to explaining the point or technical aspect of the subject matter, and instead settles for predictable action without any enjoyment.   in short, as many other reviews here say (wish i had read them before...) - stay away from this film!",0
"in texas, seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the halloween night before going to a party. meanwhile, they call the american nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears. a serial killer, who is listening to their confessions, makes their nightmares come true, killing each one of them in a sadistic way. ""american nightmare"" is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning: without any previous explanation, a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area, as if it were friday, 13th. then, the story shifts to a bar, where seven friends are celebrating halloween. from this moment on, the story has a great potential, and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance, showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies, as usual in this type of c production. however, the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse jane toppan, giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting. with a better beginning and conclusion, this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie. my vote is four.  title (brazil): ""agonia"" (""agony"")",0

"oh my... bad clothing, worse synth music and the worst: david hasselhoff. the 80's are back with vengeance in witchery, an american-italian co-production, helmed by infamous joe 'd'amato on the production side and short-careered director (thank heavens for small miracles) fabrizio laurenti directing . marketed as a kind of sequel to sam raimi's evil dead series in italy (that was dubbed ""la casa"" in there), witchery delivers some modest gore groceries and bad acting.  a mix of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the film bounces clueless from scene to another without letting some seriously wooden actors and hilarious day and night mix-ups slow it's progress to expectable ending, topped with some serious wtf surprise climax. (i just love the look on her face...) surprisingly laurenti manages to gather some suspense and air of malice in few - very few - scenes; unluckily for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go down quickly and effectively.  the plus sides are experienced, when the gore hits the fan. this department is quite effective and entertaining in that classic latex and red paint style of the 80's italo-gore, when things were made 100% hand-made and as shockingly and vivid as modest budgets could allow. i could only watch with sadistic glee and few laughters all the over-the-top ways that obnoxious characters (and actors) got mangled and misused, one by one. i only felt sorry for linda blair, who apparently haven't been let to try any other than that good old possessed girl / woman role ever in his career, or so it looks like when checking out his filmography.  well, folks - not much more to tell, and even less to tell home about. don't expect too much when spending some rainy afternoon with this, and probably you'll experience at least some mild fun. it also helps if your rotten little heart pounds in the beat of 80's euro gore horror. and speaking of hearts - every movie that has david hasselhoff getting skewered by a sizeable metal object and bleeding heavily around the room and corridors, must have it's one on the right place.  this is my truth - what is yours?",0
"this movie is unbelievably ridiculous. i love horror movies, but this is the worst one i've ever seen. i am a huge fan of gore, but most of the deaths in this movie aren't shown. it just shows us the already dead bodies, and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible. the graphics look so obviously fake. the actors are awful as well. there is no real emotion from any of them. not only did i waste my time watching this piece of sh*t movie, but i had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it. if i could rate this a -10, i would. f*ck this movie. it's crap.   don't watch it.",0

"this isn't one of those reviews about poor special effects or technology, or being dated, issues that only the dorkiest people could relate with, but rather a review on the story telling, which most of us are truly interested in.  the plot is about a combination of wwii allied and german navy members, and two civilians (the hero and heroine), who are thrust together on a german u boat and wind up in a savage land of dinosaurs.  the manipulations aren't so bad by film standards, and we know from the plot that realism isn't going to be high. what films like this need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions.  this film lacks both. for a full length film, only 6 characters are given any time, and 3 of them are barely looked into. mcclure's hero is beyond ""routine"", and doesn't make much sense in any era.  the female seems to be looking for an answer to a riddle about the land of dinosaurs they entered, but the riddle is not much of a riddle, and we could care less.  a lot of failure in a film that should have been better, even for its time.",0
"...this would be the worst film i'd ever seen. hmmm, ok maybe tied with boogeyman then. awful, truly awful.  i had low expectations and it failed to meet them! i honestly cant think of one good thing. so here are the worst points...  1. the acting 2. the plot 3. the cgi (xbox 360 has better graphics....seriously) 4. the plot 5. the dialogue and finally.... 6. the plot   there are so many unanswered questions, did they make a 2:32 hour long movie then realize they hadn't put lex luthor and superman in a scene together and were forced to settle for the 3 minute bit or did they actually think no-one would notice that the main hero and villain have less screen time together than superman's son and the henchman he kills?!!  was half the budget spent on persuading kevin spacey to do it?  when superman goes to hospital, why don't the doctors ask ""what the f*** do you want us to do?! he's a f***ing alien! we don't know jack about his anatomy!""?   what happened in the 5 years superman was away to cause technology to advance 28 years?   where the people who wrote good reviews watching the same movie?  and finally, why? just, why?   btw, for those of you wondering how come superman could lift an entire continent of krypyonite, i think i've figured it out...  ...since superman is unaffected by the kryptonite till he sees something green in the rocks, it is clearly all in his head. therefore the continent thing is just him suppressing his fear of shiny green rock....  either that or the writers are slack-jawed half-wits who didn't think that was a fairly obvious mistake.",0
"this film revolves as much around japanese culture as it does the lives of one modern japanese family. physical contact is frowned upon for those over 7 (especially in public) hence all that bowing instead of hugging even when you are close friends/ relatives. ballroom dancing involves putting your arms around someone else and that in public too! never the less ballroom dancing is (on the quite) immensely popular. people who do ballroom dancing in japan are viewed a bit like nudists in the west... many more would like to than do but are inhibited by the culture. a delightful family film, which any amateur dancer would enjoy for the dance sequences alone. i understand that it was more popular than titanic in japan. i guess the japanese are just like the rest of us - they like to be hugged too.",1
"a much undervalued film that tells the story of a young musician caught in an ever-declining spiral of domestic violence.  at times difficult to watch, while morris day is portrayed as the misogynist, prince as the knight on (motorcycle) steed, he is still called upon to twice beat a woman as part of the screenplay. that he can do this and still emerge as a flawed but vindicated hero is credit to the writing. prince is so free of ego in this film that not only does he portray himself as a narcissistic megalomaniac who beats women, but his most famous song is fictionalised as being written by his father and wendy & lisa. even further, two of his compositions - computer blue (admittedly the album's weakest track) and darling nikki - are shown as being songs that kill off an audience. perhaps the only concession to the princely ego is a card that lists the (slightly shorter than prince) apollonia as 5'6.  the nearly complete-amateur cast are mainly band members playing themselves (and reviewers who slate the actors on the terms that they've never appeared in other movies are completely missing the point), and do perfectly well under the direction. morris day gets most of the plaudits for his likable ham, though jerome benton must also get credit for bouncing off him well, particularly their stage act, which is hilarious. day and benton even go so far as to make an abbott and costello routine funny, which takes some doing.  lastly, there's prince. while i admit to bias, i do actually think he's a pretty good actor in terms of being able to portray a low-key version of himself. acting isn't his profession, this was a film made for entertainment, so anyone pointing out that the guy in the lead role isn't robert deniro and thinking they're making a point is sadly deluded. i don't want this review to be a derisory attack of other people's comments, but i've even this film slated as having a low budget and being darkly lit. how would a film about domestic violence be shot, then? with full overhead spotlights and a cgi dinosaur walking into frame?   the film acts almost as a perfect snapshot of the neon light and skinny tie era until you remember that it was actually made in a world of curly perms and tinny synths, and this isn't some retro-recreation. prince's best film with oscar-winning music, it sees him at his zenith, and it's saddening to realise that, even though he would make some fine albums, he would never again capture this high.",1
"""silverlake life"" is a documentary and it was plain and straightforward. actually, it was more like a home movie, and if you want dramatic illuminations, see something else. and it's by no means a tearjerker. but i mean that in positive ways. it shows two men who love each other and how being afflicted with aids is affecting the quality of their every-day lives. it's almost difficult for me to say whether this was a quality film or not, because it was so undressed that i had to look for other ways to respond. it's an admirable film, actually one of the most admirable, sincere documents i've ever seen. these two men have incredible integrity as their lives are reduced to the most basic parts. it makes hollow-wood productions on aids seem hip and heartless. these men made this movie for themselves, which is one of the best reasons to create something. the scene where tom sings ""you are my sunshine"" to mark and tells him goodbye is the real thing.",1

"""hot millions"" is a well-written, well-acted tale about an embezzler who steals (whoops! -- too low class a word for an embezzler, according to peter ustinov's lead character) a ""hot million"" from the london branch of a u.s. corporation by creating shell corporations on the continent and using the firm's ostensibly secure computer to transfer funds to them. (remember, spoiler police, this is a comedy, not a mystery.)   from 1968, this movie's depiction of computers may seem naive to today's more computer-literate populace; but as one who has worked with computers since before this film was released, i would assert that even then, this smacks of having been written by and for computer illiterates, probably on purpose to heighten the droll comedic aspects of this british flick.   if one has little taste for this type of entertainment, the movie may seem to drag in spots. fortunately, it has a nicely wrapped-up ending; unfortunately, the end credits give no indication of the classical music used therein -- the symphonic piece at the end and the piano-flute duet in the middle -- just the song sung by lulu which i totally don't remember.",1
"well, the movie isn't exactly ""funny.""  okay, i admit, there are a few humorous lines, but definitely nothing that is laugh-out-loud funny. for example: right before a steamy sex scene between eleniak and one of her male costars, sh is handcuffed to the bedpost and he cannot remove her shirt. before leaving the room to retrieve the key, he tells her, ""okay, don't go anywhere.""  see, humorous, but not funny.  the plot and acting are pretty good.  but erika eleniak definitely steals the show. she's hot and sexy and there is a really steamy scene with her that one can't help but rewind and re-watch.  there are also some other very sexy scenes with her and she has some very provocative lines.  overall, 5 stars. i'd only give it three if not for erika eleniak.",1

"the lady in cement is a veritable course on social anthropology of the late 60's. the writing, not the acting, is at center stage. did i say - pure camp! prepare to be offended if you are female or gay. broad and dame are standard terms and gay baiting and bashing are represented for what they were in the day (camp- wise). most of the lines are tossed off although there are wonderful performances by a very few outstanding character actors. the action scenes are mundane but it is fun to see dan blocker play a tough guy who likes bashing toughs. and lanie kazan and racquel welsh are at the voluptuous peak of their careers. amazing to note they were both 28 years old and mr. sinatra was 53. the musical score, wait . . . was there a score? well, you get the point. watch it with friends who want a good laugh. it's full of them.",0

"i saw this film about twenty years ago on the late show. i still vividly remember the film, especially the performance of robert taylor. i always thought taylor was underrated as an actor as most critics saw him as solid, almost dull leading man type, and women simply loved to watch his films because of his looks. this film, however, proved what an interesting actor he could be. he did not get enough roles like this during his long career. this is his best performance. he is totally believable in a truly villainous role. from what i have read, he was a very hardworking and easy going guy in real life and never fought enough for these kind of roles. he basically would just do what mgm gave him. this film proves that he could have handled more diverse and difficult roles. the other thing i remember about this film is how annoying lloyd nolan's character was. nolan was a great actor, but this character really aggravated me. the last scene of the film has stuck with me for all of these years. this film is definitely worth a look.",1

"i was willing to go with the original _cruel intentions._ it went along with the plot and stayed true to the characters of one of my favorite stories. however, this movie was, in my opinion, a crummy rehash with essentially the same story line and no clear character choices. i didn't honestly care what happened to any of them. the strongest part of the original story (les liasons, not ci) is the characters and their interactions, not the events themselves. i wasn't clear until i read the imdb that this movie was meant to be a prequel, especially since the title includes a number ""2,"" i expected a sequel, but then determined that it must be a companion piece. over all, i must say that this movie read, to me at least, like a soft porn version of les liasons. i was not impressed.",0
"one doesn't get to enjoy this gem, the 1936 invisible ray, often. but no can forget it. the story is elegant. karloff, austere and embittered in his carpathian mountain retreat, is janos rukh, genius science who reads ancient beams of light to ascertain events in the great geological pastparticularly the crash of a potent radioactive meteor in africa. joining him is the ever-elegant lugosi (as a rare hero), who studies ""astro-chemistry."" frances drake is the lovely, underused young wife; frank lawton the romantic temptation; and the divine violet kemble cooper is mother rukh, in a performance worthy of maria ospenskya.  the story moves swiftly in bold episodes, with special effects that are still handsome. it also contains some wonderful lines. one rukh restores his mother's sight, he asks, ""mother, can you see, can you see?"" ""yes, i can seemore clearly than ever. and what i see frightens me."" even better when mother rukh says, ""he broke the first law of science."" i am not alone among my acquaintance in having puzzled for many many years exactly what this first law of science is.  this movie is definitely desert island material.",1

"(aka: trinity is still my name) this sequel looks like it was done to capitalize on the outstanding european box-office success of they call me trinity, only this time joseph e. levine and avco-embassy pictures wanted to capitalize on it in america as well. too bad they didn't get very far since the hill/spencer pictures have had only had marginal success here in the u.s., and this largely boring, drawn-out film doesn't help it out any.  trinity and bambino swear to their dying father (harry carey jr.) that they will become successful outlaws and take care of each other. they later get involved with arms-traffickers who smuggle guns out of a monastery, and who mistakenly think they're a pair of federal agents. it all winds up falling flat in spite of a couple of funny scenes, especially the one where trinity and bambino are in a fancy french restaurant and don't know how to carry themselves. and the scenes with the card sharks was mildly humorous as well.  the opening title music sung by gene roman sounds like a fair bobby goldsboro-like early 70s pop song while the music cues sprinkled throughout the movie are pretty good. not sure if i'd want to buy the cd soundtrack of it but some others might.  the film could have had a half hour whacked off of it and it wouldn't have dragged on for so long. it looks like a lot of scenery is being chewed up here. in fact, i lost interest in it about 2/3rds of the way through. the dvd is also terrible, with a constant hum in the soundtrack and a poor print that looks like it should have been sent to that great scrap heap in the sky.  a big step down from the previous film.  4 out of 10",0
"halloween is not only the godfather of all slasher movies but the greatest horror movie ever! john carpenter and debra hill created the most suspenseful, creepy, and terrifying movie of all time with this classic chiller. michael myers is such a phenomenal monster in this movie that he inspired scores of imitators, such as jason vorhees (friday the 13th), the miner (my bloody valentine), and charlie puckett (the night brings charlie). okay, so i got a little obscure there, but it just goes to show you the impact that this movie had on the entire horror genre. no longer did a monster have to come from king tut's tomb or from dr. frankenstein's lab. he could be created in the cozy little neighborhoods of suburbia. and on the night he came home...haddonfield, illinois and the viewers would never be the same. there are many aspects of this movie that make it the crowning jewel of horror movies. first is the setting...it takes place in what appears to be a normal suburban neighborhood. many of us who grew up in an area such as this can easily identify with the characters. this is the type of neighborhood where you feel safe, but if trouble starts to brew, nobody wants to lift a finger to get involved (especially when a heavy-breathing madman is trying to skewer our young heroine.) along with the setting, the movie takes place on halloween!! the scariest night of the year! while most people are carving jack-o-lanterns, michael myers is looking to carve up some teenie-boppers. besides the setting, there is some great acting. jamie lee curtis does a serviceable job as our heroine, laurie strode, a goody-two-shoes high-schooler who can never seem to find a date. however, it is donald pleasance, as dr. sam loomis, who really steals the show. his portrayal of the good doctor, who knows just what type of evil hides behind the black eyes of michael myers and feels compelled to send him to hell once and for all, is the stuff of horror legend. however, it is the synthesizer score that really drives this picture as it seems to almost put the viewer into the film. once you hear it, you will never forget it. i also enjoy the grainy feel to this picture. nowadays, they seem to sharpen up the image of every movie, giving us every possible detail of the monster we are supposed to be afraid of. in halloween, john carpenter never really lets us get a complete look at michael myers. he always seems like he is a part of the shadows, and, i think that is what makes him so terrifying. there are many scenes where michael is partly visible as he spies on the young teens (unbeknownst to them), which adds to his creepiness. if you think about, some wacko could be watching you right now and you wouldn't even know it. unfortunately for our teenagers (and fortunately for us horror fans), when they find michael, he's not looking for candy on this halloween night..he's looking for blood. finally, michael myers, himself, is a key element to this movie's effectiveness. his relentless pursuit of laurie strode makes him seem like the killer who will never stop. he is the bogeyman that will haunt you for the rest of your life. so,if you have not seen this movie (if there are still some of you out there who haven't, or even if you have), grab some popcorn, turn off every light, pop this into the old dvd and watch in fright. trick or treat!",1
"this movie really surprised me. i had my doubts about it at first but the movie got better and better for each minute.   it is maybe not for the action seeking audience but for those that like an explicit portrait of a very strange criminal, man, lover and husband. if you're not a fan of bad language or sexual content this really is not for you.   the storyline is somewhat hard to follow sometimes, but in the end i think it made everything better. the ending was unexpected since you were almost fouled to think it would end otherwise.   as for the acting i think it was good. it will not be up for an oscar award for long but it at least caught my eye. gil bellows portrait of a prison man is not always perfect but it is very entertaining. shaun parkes portrait of bellows prison mate clinique is great and extremely powerful. on the downside i think i will put esai morales portrait of markie.  take my advice and watch this movie, either you will love it or dislike it!",1
"i enjoyed a lot watching this movie. it has a great direction, by the already know bigas luna, born in spain. and it is precisely in spain that the movie takes place, in cataluña, to be more precise.  luna explores once more the theme of an obcession, in this case the obcession of a young boy for the women's milk. there are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother. in the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mother's milk go to the recently born son. so he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him. he finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around this.  this movie lives a lot on imagery, more than the story itself, the espectator captures certain moments (unforgettable moments) and certain symbols (the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something...). the surroundings, the landscapes, typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters, also symbolic, and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by nicola piovani transport us to another dimension, not parallel to the real world, but which intersects it from times to times... worth living in that world, worth watching this movie, even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession, which is perhaps taken beyond the limits...  i also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist... 8/10",1
"bizarre take on the cinderella tale. terribly poor script, but kathleen turner turns in a pretty decent evil step-mother performance.  visually stunning in some parts, but that's about it. the period costumes range from the elizabethan era to the 1990s. fast forward until you see something interesting and save yourself the full 90 minutes of drivel.  if you're really in the mood for a cinderella story - i suggest ""ever after: a cinderella story"" or ""the glass slipper"".",0
"this film was more effective in persuading me of a zionist conspiracy than a muslim one. and i'm jewish.  anbody go to journalism school? read an editorial? freshman year rhetoric? these alarmist assertions, presented in a palatable way, might prove persuasive. but by offering no acknowledgment of possible opposing arguments, nor viable (or any at all) solutions, few sources and each of dubious origin, makes the argument an ineffectual diatribe.  and thank goodness for that -- i wouldn't want anyone to leave the theatre believing any of this racist claptrap.  a good lesson for me -- and hopefully a cautionary tale for you -- to actually read about a film before seeing it.",0
"until today i had never seen this film. its was filmed on the sets of the old dark house and frankenstein and concerns a small bavarian village where supposedly giant bats are sucking the blood of the villagers.  frankly its a damn good movie that has atmosphere to spare and a cast that won't quit, lionel atwill, dwight frye, faye wray and melvin douglas playing a character named brettschnieder which is of interest to me since that was my great grandmother's maiden name.  this is a carefully modulated film that has suspense and witty one liners that slowly builds for its brief running time, only going astray when about ten minutes before the end they realized they had limited time to wrap everything up. from that point to the end its a straight run to the finish with very little of the fun that preceded it.  leonard maltin and imdb list a running time of 71 minutes and warn of shorter prints. the trouble is that imdb and maltin can be wrong, and in this case i think they are since a source i trust more says the full running time is 67 minutes (the overlook film encyclopedia) quibbling about this i know is insane but since most prints that are available tend to run around 60-63 minutes the amount of missing material is considerably less if its only 67 minutes long. personally i think it won't matter that much since its at most five minutes and i doubt very much it will make or break the film.  what ever the running time , if you like creaky old films, do, by all means do, watch this movie, its a great dark and stormy night film.",1
"well, what can i say, this movie really got to me, it's not so bad, as many say, i really loved it, although the idea seems so simple, and rather boring, it isn't. first of all i enjoyed the soundtrack (bryan adams), it really goes with the movie. second the simple story, and the drama of spirit gets your attention. one thing i like the most is that they didn't give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now do they ?, but... i don't know, making animals talk is just so... lame.  one of the most beautiful animations of 2002 in my opinion, i recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing.",1
"finally, an indie film that actually delivers some great scares! i see most horror films that come out... theatrical, straight-to-dvd, cable, etc... and most of them suck... a few are watchable... even fewer are actually good... dark remains is one of the good ones. i caught a screening of this film at the south padre island film festival... the audience loved it... and my wife and i loved it! having no name actors, i assume the budget on this film was pretty low, but you wouldn't know it... the film looks fantastic... the acting totally works for the film... the story is good... and the scares are great! while most filmmakers focus solely on the scares, they often forget about story and character development, two things that help to deliver the scares more efficiently. brian avenet-bradley must know that character and story are important. he develops both to the point where you care about the characters, you know the characters, and are therefore more scared when they are in danger.  watching horror films that cost anywhere from $80 million to $5000 to make, i find ""dark remains"" to be one of the gems out there. check this film out!",1
"with goldie hawn and peter sellers in a movie you figure this one won't go wrong. but what can i say? this was a horrible misfire. the movie is about peter sellers as an older gentleman who suddenly finds himself in a relationship with a really strange young not to mention attractive hippie in goldie hawn. the movie is incredibly disjointed and i did not understand anything about it. peter sellers and goldie hawn are very funny people but this movie does not prove it.  that song about arabella cinderella' is pretty cool, but that is it. i only recommend this movie to people that like to watch an extreme novelty movie, this is almost the definition of one. i guess this movie more than anything else is a sign of the times, in terms of it's definite experimentalism and all around unconventionality, the problem is the quality is completely shot and the writing, not to mention the direction is just so out there.   peter sellers in particular is very hit and miss, he will go from dr. strangelove and being there throughout his career, to dumb movies like this and the magic christian, which was very similar to this one in context and style, but that movie did have a few funny moments. this one is senseless, and i am sad that someone as great as peter sellers was in this movie. not recommended for anyone.",0
"this was quite possibly the worst movie i have ever seen. i watched it with a large group of friends and after it was over not a one of us understood the plot. aside from the lack of plot, the acting was atrocious, the ""special effects"" were not so special, and the writing was absolutely horrible. the movie's only redeeming factor is that it's so incredibly bad that it's quite funny. you can't help but laugh at a zombie being run over while actors are spewing crappy dialogue. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone looking for a good movie, but it's something that a group of friends can get together and have a good laugh about. it's now a running joke among my friends and i. 1 out of 10.",0
"american boy jesse took the train to vienna in order to take the plane for usa. on the train he met a french girl celine. although they met the first time, they talked like good friends. when the train stopped at vienna, jesse begged celine to accompany him to have a tour on vienna. then the romantic story unfolded.  at first they were cautious. the funniest scene was their listening to cd in music store. they peeked at each other, though their eyes did not contact. after in-depth conversation, they relationship became close. then i saw the most romantic scene that they pretended to call their respective friend. their deep love for each other was expressed completely by words.  love is a strange thing. when you really want it, it will not come as you wished. love needs mutual understanding. without it, love will not last long. spiritual harmony is the most important for love.  excellent screenplay and performance resulted in huge success of the movie.  one of the best romance movies. 9/10",1
"i watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on, it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful. i urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be, surely it was deliberate. i cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish, unrehearsed, badly executed way that it was beyond belief. this is the movie that makes spiceworld look like goodfellas, think i am exaggerating? well give it airtime and think again. dreadful, utterly dreadful. if this wasn't a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should be removed and promptly shot after being forced to watch this film again.",0
"this 2004 oscar nominee is a very short b/w film in spanish. a young woman goes into a café, gets a coffee, and notices a couple of musicians standing silently with their instruments. all the patrons are motionless, like mannequins. one guy, however, is quite jolly and breaks into a song about what goes on at 7:35 in the morning. there is one surprising moment after another until the end which is quite, well, surprising. the people, the place, everything looks quite ordinary. and like the musical piece ""bolero"", the thing keeps building until the climax. with its structure, theme,movement and wit,it is an 8 minute masterpiece.",1
"this is the kind of movie that leaves you with one impression.. story writing is what movie making is about.   incredible visual effects.. very good acting, especially from shue. everything is perfect.. except.. the story is just poor and so, everything fails.  picture this, if you had the power to be invisible.. what would you do? well, our mad scientist here (played by kevin bacon) could think of no other thing to do but fondle and rape women.. this is all his supposedly ""genius"" mind could think of. does he try to gain extra power? no. he doesn't even bother research a way to get back to being visible. the guy is basically a sex crazed maniac.  add to that, the lab atmosphere, you have all these young guys.. throwing around jokes like they were in a bar.. if it wasn't for all the white coats and equipment, you would think this is a bad imitation of ""cheers."" very shallow and poor personalities and very little care is put into making you think these guys are anything but lambs for the hollow man's wolf.  even as a thriller, the movie falls way short because most of the ""thrilling"" scenes are written out so poorly and are full of illogical behaviors by the actors that are just screaming ""this is just a stupid thing i have to do so that the hollow man can find me alone and kill me.""  if you read the actual book, while the scientist (cane) goes after women, there is a lot of mental manipulation and disturbing thought that goes into his character. in the movie, cane is just the sick guy who goes to a crowded marketplace to rub his body in women and get off on it. just sad.",0
"i enjoyed albert pyun's ""nemesis"" for its cheesy action and semi-complicated script. a lot of people complain about the ""confusing"" plot to the first film, which is probably why ""nemesis 2: nebula"" has a dumb as rocks plot with the same super-action to carry it through.  this one gives the name of the first movie's hero, alex, to a bulked up super-female sent to the past to save the future. she is raised by a tribe in africa. a good portion of the film only has dialogue in an african tongue without subtitles, which i liked because it made it seem somewhat authentic (how often do movies in this genre really try to do that?). it doesn't take long for the evil cyborgs to time travel back in time to find her and try to kill her.  don't get me wrong, this is a piece of crap (not that the first one was anything great). there are subplots involving africa's political unrest, treasure hunting, and tribal combat. the picture is very short on brains, so none of these things gets a very good treatment. the picture is basically a drawn out fight with some chases that boils down to muscle-babe vs. cyborg. it has its entertainment value, just don't expect quality, or anything of the first movie.",1
"this little show is obviously some stupid little prequel/spin off of the original series.  compared to the live action series this show is utter crap. the live action show had intelligent jokes and story lines. while the animated series is basically a toned down bittersweet version for younger viewers to digest but i think maybe kids deteste this crap.  the storyline in every episode is basically just sabrina has some stupid and pointless dillemma and she uses magic to fix it. thats basiclly the idea every episode. the most bizarre episode was when sabrina uses magic to become gem and gem to become sabrina. so then gem becomes a witch and hypnotizes harvery to become her slave. this then leads to a bizarre yet rather interesting scene were gem says ""just adore me for now"" and harvey get down on his hands and knees and starts kissing her feet like shes a god.

"the story-line of ""the thief of bagdad"" is complex, owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together. the screenplay by lajo biros and the dialogue by miles malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all points.the young king ahmad of bagdad is angry at his vizier jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas. he discovers while in disguise that people blame him for jaffar's deeds and hate him. he is imprisoned by jaffar, where he meets abu the young thief. the two escape and take a boat to the city of basra. there the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the princess of the city passing by. ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden. he tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss. then he is captured. when jaffar comes to win the princess of basra for himself, ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns abu into a dog. jaffar then asks for the princess's hand, and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the sultan of basra. the blind ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace, accompanied by abu as his dog. the prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her. so jaffar sends his servant halima for ahmad and the dog, in hopes the prince can rouse her. he does awaken her. she boards a ship to find a doctor to cure ahmad, but she is captured by jaffar who then throws the dog overboard. she then allows jaffar to take her in his arms, on his promise to restore ahmad's sight and turn abu back into a thief. the princess sees a vision of ahmad; he is in a boat; jaffar sends a storm to beset him and abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island. abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle. abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel, then corks him in again. for freeing him, he gets three wishes. his first is for sausages. in the meanwhile, the princess pleads with her father to refuse jaffar; but jaffar shows the sultan a new mechanical toy, one of whose six arms stabs him to death. abu makes a second wish, to find ahmad. the cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the all-seeing eye. abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye, battling a giant spider, then scaling the goddess's statue. abu gazes into the 'eye' and sees ahmad in a canyon. he has the genie take him to ahmad. ahmad uses the eye to see the princess. she smells a flower and forgets everything at once. abu wishes they were in bagdad, but the genie laughs and leaves; jaffar tells the princess that she is in love with him, omitting mention of ahmad. ahmad tries to fight his way to the princess, but jaffar smashes the 'eye'. abu finds himself in the ""land of legend"", where the old men who rule want to make him their king. he steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead, to hurry to save ahmad and the princess. the thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner, using his bow from the flying carpet, to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution. jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse, but another shot from the bow finishes him. ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his princess; but when he tries to make abu his vizier, the young thief refuses, saying that what he wants is adventure, not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be. this fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer alexander korda. the production was designed by vincent korda who was also art director, while georges perinal did the colorful cinematography. the directors credited are ludwig berger and michael powell, with tim whelan, alexander korda, william cameron menzies and zoltan korda participating. the extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of john armstrong, oliver messel and marcel vertes. the production, apart from its gorgeous and expensive-looking visual splendors, i claim is dominated by two other elements, the choral music of miklos rozsa and the performance by conrad veidt as the evil jaffar. rex ingram plays the genie with a curious accent, plus his usual intelligence and power. june duprez is lovely and effective as the princess mary morris is a sad and beautiful halima, and miles malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious sultan. as ahmad, john justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some; he is memorably good in his winning role. this film has a spaciousness about it that is found, i assert, in other korda works also. its imaginative content stands in contrast to very-strong realistic sets, costumes and set-design elements. this is one of the most memorable idea-level fantasies of all time, worthy to be enjoyed over and over.",1
"""stairway to heaven"" is a outstanding invention of movie making, probably never duplicated. i rank it with ""the wizard of oz"" and ""african queen,"" although it is a totally different type of movie than ""african queen."" ""stairway to heaven"" is a psycho-drama that uses performance concepts and technical effects that, to my knowledge, are totally unique.   for example, there is the combination of b&w and color footage - as in ""oz,"" but the significance of the contrast goes way beyond the simple - but beautiful - effect achieved in ""oz."" in ""stairway"" the purpose and effect of the contrast can only be described as powerful.  another brilliant aspect of ""stairway"" is the concept of ""time"" and how it is used here. how could anybody have conceived of a better way to make time stand still  literally? and then there is the stairway itself!  if you have any imagination at all, you will agree with me. ""stairway to heaven"" is a true gem.",1

"a meltdown at a nuclear power plant causes a majority of people to turn into lethal, rot-faced, shambling zombies who naturally go on a grisly rampage. a ragtag handful of uninfected folks do their best to survive this grueling ordeal. director/co-writer/producer todd sheets displays an appealingly sincere love and passion for go-straight-for-the-throat lively and gruesome horror fare: he maintains an unflagging snappy pace throughout, fills the screen with wall-to-wall crazy action, and thankfully keeps the terrible dialogue to a pleasing minimum. moreover, sheets certainly doesn't skimp on the gloriously graphic and excessive over-the-top splatter: this picture delivers a tasty truckload of flesh melting, evisceration, lots of gut munching, one dude has his heart yanked out, and there's even a nice impalement on a tree branch. sheets earns bonus points for keeping the tone grim and nasty to the literal bitter end (for example, almost all of the main characters wind up becoming zombie chow). granted, this flick has its fair share of flaws: the ragged editing, several ham-fisted attempts at pathos, and the largely awful acting from a rank no-name cast all leave a good deal to be desired. top thespic honors go to the pretty and perky kasey rausch for her winningly spunky portrayal of the resourceful daria trumillio. frank dunlay likewise does well as rugged take-charge army veteran ralph walsh. best of all, sheets' sure grasp of an infectiously slambang sense of unrelenting headlong momentum and obvious affinity for the horror genre ensure that this remains a total blast to watch from start to finish.",1

"for the big thinkers among us, ""the intruder"" is a maddeningly incoherent movie from france that gives so-called ""art films"" a bad name. the story is something about a bitter old coot, louis trebor (michel subor), who goes searching in tahiti for a heart transplant, but beyond that, i have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing. with no coherent storyline to boast of, the movie loses us early on, though i'm perfectly willing to admit that there might be somebody out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film.   this muddled, snail-paced drama runs a full two hours and five minutes - though i seriously doubt anyone with any kind of a life will still be hanging around by the closing credits.",0

"four prisoners share a single cell: the domineering transvestite, marcus (clovis cornillac); marcus's idiot savant buddy, paquerette (dimitri rataud), who will eat anything in sight including pocket watches, cockroaches, and his little sister; lassalle (philippe laudenbach), the intelligent librarian who murdered his wife; and carrère (gérald laroche), the new guy who was caught up in corporate fraud and is now focused on escaping. after a brick falls from the wall of the cell, the men discover the hidden journal written by a 'fountain of youth'-obsessed serial killer who occupied the cell in the 1920s. is this journal the secret to their escape? or is there something much more sinister behind it?  i was a little weary about getting into this film because the only other experience i have with eric valette was the dreadful one missed call (2008), which i consider to be the worst theatrically released film i've ever seen. however, much of what was wrong with one missed call could probably be attributed to klavan's awful script, because (as i remember) valette's direction wasn't the worst part about the film (unless he chose to include the baby). anyway, maléfique was a good way to get my respect back. . . it's a french film (obviously something i like) and it takes place in prison (which is my second favourite horror setting after asylums). so that's two points for him before the film even starts. luckily, valette had me once the film ended as well. maléfique is a rather deep, rather complex, rather compelling story of obsession and desperation. . . the desire and need to bring fantasies to reality. while it's not a terrifying film in the traditional sense, the oddity of its power makes it pretty damn frightening. the period between the climax and conclusion was some of the best film i've seen in quite some time and i would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a decent psychological thriller with some pretty cool gore.  final verdict: 8.5/10. quite a bit of respect earned back by valette.  note: paramount picked up the rights to make an american remake (surprise surprise). it's due out in 2009. i'm not sure why, to be honest, as this doesn't seem like something that would be a big moneymaker here in the states. but, i've been surprised before.  vive la france!   -ap3-",1
"i watched this because i thought there were going to be a lot of car chases and cool cars to gawk at. guess i was lied to. this movie is very boring.  the movie starts out kip raines(giovanni ribisi) sitting outside a porsche dealership checking to see if they have the right car. when they confirm it's the right one, kip gets a brick out of the trunk and chucks it at the window, shattering it. he gets the porsche while his friend gets the keys. they start up the car and take off into the night. they deliver it to a warehouse only to have been followed by the police. so, the whole crew ditches all the cars and go their separate ways. then, we get a glimpse of memphis raines. he is giving a little speech to a bunch of kids at a go-kart track. then, he is confronted by atlee jackson(will patton). atlee tells memphis that his brother kip is in deep *bleep*. memphis is known as one of the most notorious car thieves in los angeles. memphis heads to a junkyard and meets raymond calitri(christopher ecclesten). this guy threatens to kill kip if memphis doesn't deliver 50 cars within 72 hours.  there are a few problems with this film:   1.story: the first 48 in-movie hours take place when cage and duvall are looking for a crew and planning everything out. the last 12 in-movie hours are a waste!   2. the cars: you see maybe 10 cars out of the 50 as the movie advertises. so, where are the other 40 cars? why don't we get to see them?   3. the chase: the chase at the end of the movie was a joke. it was not suspenseful at all.  4. the dog: somewhere in the movie, the dog eats the burgers and swallows three keys as well. this is impossible. the keys were flipped open. the keys would have severely damaged the dog's esophagus, stomach, and large intestines. the guys suggest giving the dog laxatives to help him poop it out. this won't work. the dog will get a lot of diarrhea but no keys. it was stated in jackass after ryan dunne stuck a toy car up his rectum. take laxatives, lots of diarrhea, but no car. same case with the dog.  5. the cop during the chase: when eleanor breaks down for a few minutes, nicholas cage tries desperately to start up the car. you see a police cruiser behind him who isn't looking at his car at all. but, right when nicholas cage starts the engine up again, the police officer jerks his head to the right, sees the car, and immediately begins to chase after him. it is stupid. so, right when he heard the engine start, and saw the car, he knew that was the car he was looking for. how does he know it's the right car? he only sees the back of it.  overall, the movie is boring. there is no action. there are very few cars. the movie is stupid. i have never seen the original but i plan to.  i give this movie 1 star out of 10. get the fast and furious instead.",0
"whoever made this movie must have done it as a joke. i mean, this was the stupidest movie i think i have ever seen!! a killer snowman terrorizes a small town? give me a break. love it when he takes off driving the cop car. more like a comedy than a horror movie. if you want a laugh, rent this. if you truly want a horror movie, stay the hell away from this one!!",0
atlantis was much better than i had anticipated. in some ways it had a better story than come of the other films aimed at a higher age. although this film did demand a soid attention span at times. it was a great film for all ages. i noticed some of the younger audience expected a comedy but got an adventure. i think everyone is tired of an endless parade of extreme parodies. a lot of these kids have seen nothing but parodies. after a short time everyone seemed very intensely watching atlantis.,1
"with no fault to the actors (they all put on great performances), the overall story was not very well executed. the movie opens with a great zinger: a crazy old guy forces a young aborigine girl's car off the road. but then, we're forced to endure 40 minutes of character development with an entirely new group of characters ... and we don't know why until the 40 minutes are up. it turns out that they are the ones who eventually discover the girl's body ... and the story progresses from there.  while the story does pick up at that point, it really goes nowhere. after 2 hours, i asked myself: was there a point to this, or was it just to see the characters struggle with accusations of racism and stupidity of how they handled the discovery? the story was ultimately unsatisfying and felt unfinished. while it is well acted, there's not a strong enough backbone in the film to warrant recommending it.",0
"wow, what can i say about this film? it's a lousy piece of crap. i'm surprised that it got rated as high as it did. what's wrong with this film? here's a better question: what's not wrong with this film.  the story itself is just crap and cliché. here's pretty much what it's about...some kinda nerdy kid with no friends gets picked on, gets killed, and comes back as a scarecrow for revenge. ""all"" of that is packed into 86 minutes of worthless film. if you haven't seen this movie don't waste your time watching it. also, the second one isn't much better, so don't bother watching that either...i rated this movie a three because i liked the scarecrow's outfit, not because there was anything good about the movie. i think you get the picture.",0
"this is a very odd film ... i wasn't really sure what is was about, some n london lowlifes find a mute kid in the woods that they all believe is some kind of oracle and somehow makes them all, in their own way, change something about their lives that usually ends in disaster. the film ended after about 90 minutes leaving me feeling quite unsatisfied, almost annoyed at the pointlessness of it all. i didn't care about any of the characters - none of them get a chance to endear themselves to the viewer.  what was the message? am i being dim? it was just too odd. what happens to runner? why does emilio shoot the kid? ... that made absolutely no sense, pointless. can someone help me understand this mess of a film?",0
"while the overall idea of escape from atlantis was intriguing, i found the film to be far less than what i had hoped for upon reading the plot summery. perhaps i am too much of a child in the technological age: the movie was made, as it is now 2002, an official five years ago --after viewing fantasy epics such as lord of the rings, and science fiction feats like star wars, as a whole it could not compare to other movies of similar line such as dinotopia or homer's the odyssey.  my beef, basically, is that i couldn't relate --i am just about the same age of the children (a young adult), and have no trouble putting myself in the place of a middle-aged man if that is the character available. but the picture did not take me to a different mental plain of existence. i didn't find myself saying 'ack! i would have done the same thing!'. it did not open the doors to my imagination. even without comparing it to high-budget films or other tv movies, standing alone, certain aspects of the feature i found to be cliche: the character development in the children occurred too rapidly for my liking, seeing too much of the stereotypical selfish-teenager-bitter-after-divorce image changing into the we're-a-big-happy-family-let's-never-separate-again feel that can ultimately make or break a picture in the long run. even the characters themselves could have undergone improvement: a typical set of one or the other stereotypes. there was the ever-present selfish beauty looking to be rebellious, accompanied by mr. perfect image of combining athletics, good looks and intelligence yet a brooding attitude, and lastly the smart-aleck little brother we find to be so common these days. while i know the personalities pushed the story along, i think that adding more individuality as far as nuances and more unique differences would have made it a more enjoyable --and believable (as far as character)-- movie.  i do have to raise my glass to the costume and set design --that made it worth finishing to the end for me. don't get me wrong: all movies are worth seeing for yourself, and the opinion of one could never account for the opinion of many, but i think that with a little more depth to the script, and a little more (i cannot believe i am saying this) realness i dare say escape from atlantis could have been magical.",0
"johny to makes here one of his best style exercises, making a strong film with a good yakuza's story. the election of the new yakuza's boss is the beginning of a war inside the organization.  in my opinion the violence is wise used in the context, making a very strong gangs film. i specially love the way he tells the history, moving around all the roles inside the yakuza's family, and making that we see the violence, like the only way they have to solve their problems...  talking about, the technical aspects, the film is a good example of paused, rythmic and planified way of shooting a film. one of the hong kong films of the year. is like infernal affairs, but without the easy action-violence scenes, and the confused storyline. strongly recommended to all asian films lovers.

"i'm not sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler, but i'm playing it safe, so don't read this if you haven't seen the movie.  i adore this movie, and so does everyone i work with -- and that is the point. i spent a large part of my working life in cinema, without being an actor. such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie: the gaffers, the pullers, the on-air directors, the lighters and writers, the costume people etc etc, and the whole thing is told from their point of view, at least to a great extent. most actors are nuts and self-absorbed to the point of absurdity, which is what this movie spoofs so well, but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real-life drama! possible spoiler alert: in one great scene, the two leads, both actors, are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal, something entirely 'out-of-script', with another actor, and they start making up lines, rehearsing them, and critiquing each other's performance.  since this movie appeared in, what was it, '91, it has become fashionable to do this, especially on tv. but hardly anyone has done it so well.",1
"if you've read the original novel, as i did, you will probably hate this thing.  the film version of _absolute beginners_ is a nightmarish conglomerate of 1980s anachronisms attempting to create a ""period piece"" set in the late 1950s and failing to re-create or even pay homage to that period -- the us monstrosity of _dirty dancing_ does similar to 1963, except that film proved financially successful despite having equally amateurish screen writing. in addition to suffering from ""looking too 1980s"", the characters have been changed, re-arranged, and downplayed to the point that the only characteristics they have in common with those of the novel are the slightest superficial looks and, of course, their names: suze is transformed from the narrator's flighty ex-girlfriend and promiscuous negrophile who willingly plans to marry a closeted old queen for money (at her own admittance in the first few pages) into a hapless and naive ""eve""-archetype seduced by fame and glamour, exploited and somehow scammed into a sham marriage by her boss, who surprisingly wasn't given a van dyke and pointy hairstyle. she and the narrator, re-named ""colin"" (after the book's author, colin macinnes) for the film, are also in a relationship.  big jill's character, a lesbian seemingly butch yet ""fop like"" in her mid-20s who acts as pimp to a cadre of young and bubble-headed lesbians, and one of the narrator's closest friends, dispensing frank wisdom to the narrator, is reduced to a sort of ""named extra"" with only a few throw-away lines, and tonnes of comical outfits.  the fabulous hoplite, a gay young man and another close friend of the narrator in the novel, is also reduced to the point of being pointless in the film, camped-up and all but ignored.  the narrator's father in the novel is a sort of sad minor character but in the film, he's played to come off as optimistic and oddly spirited despite the squalid neighbourhood, and the disarray of his marriage to the narrator's mum seems, for all practical purposes, ignored.  in its favour, the music (for what it is) is well-composed, and you have to give the production and writing crews credit for actually taking a line from the book (""...some days, they'll write musicals about the 1950s..."") as their inspiration to write a musical, but in the world of bad camped-up musicals, this is among the most poorly executed in the bunch. unlike _shock treatment_ or _starstruck_ crucial plot elements are treated as afterthoughts. unlike _the apple_, there is a choppy and uneven flow between musical numbers and spoken dialogue.  you really can't blame it's ""too 1980s"" feel on the fact that it was created in the 1980s. the film version of _annie_ released in 1981, pays a wonderfully well-executed tribute to the look and feel of new york city in the 1930s, and _napolean dynamite_ manages to capture a gritty sort of look and feel of the 1980s despite being made on a low budget in 2003 (though it's not explicitly set in the 1980s, those who lived through the decade cannot deny that the film ""feels very 1980s""). obviously, it was _possible_ to make something good out of this, especially considering the iconic status that the source novel has in the uk, but it fails most apparently in the look and feel, and also in its treatment of the source material, which is downright disrespectful.  perhaps if you haven't read and have no intentions of reading the novel, you could enjoy this campy 1980s anachronism giving a shameful parody of late-1950s soho london's modernist jazz set. i can definitely see what the writing team were attempting, but they definitely could have done better. with boy george as a household name and mixed-race musicians and bands on the charts in 1986 uk, they definitely did _not_ need to bowdlerise the characters in the ways that they ended up doing. in fact, i'd go so far as saying that the writers wound up doing what both the book and film criticised harshly -- it ended up having a bunch of adults cranking out crap and treating its targeted teen-aged audience like two-bit idiots to make a quick buck off of.",0
"i must say that, looking at hamlet from the perspective of a student, brannagh's version of hamlet is by far the best. his dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded. it helps the play come to life on screen, and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching, as we did while studying it, to follow and analyze the text.  one of the things i have heard criticized many times is the casting of major hollywood names in the play. i find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier, as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with shakespeare.  also, his flashbacks help to clear up many ambiguities in the text. such as how far the relationship between hamlet and ophelia really went and why fortinbras just happened to be at the castle at the end. all in all, not only does this version contain some brilliant performances by actors both familiar and not familiar with shakespeare. it is presented in a way that one does not have to be an english literature ph.d to understand and enjoy it.",1
"it is a pleasure to see such creativity on tv again. this show is poetic, artistic and good fun. the characters relate well and the writing is not bad (i think it will improve as they get their legs). definitely worth a look.  the girls steal the show so far in this series. chuck is adorable as is olive. the two aunts are a delight. i sincerely hope they write them into bigger parts as they are magic.  well, that's all the news that is fit to print. go make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and enjoy something fun in an old fashioned way. this is like dr. seuss for adults.",1
"i think this could've been a decent movie, and some of its parts are ok... but in whole it's a b movie. same about the plot, parts are ok but it has several holes and oddities that doesn't quite add up. acting is mostly ok, i've seen worse of this too. :)  the beginning sets the level, with cars driving in the desert, making ""cool"" but totally unnecessary jumps through some small dunes (in slow motion! cool!), like the drivers had never seen sand before... it gets slightly better from there, but not much.  if you're gonna rent this, get another one too and use this one as a warm-up. keep expectations low and it might work for you.",0
"i've seen this movie when i was young, and i remembered it as one of the first films i have truly liked that was not an action movie or a comedy. so, in my later years i decided to watch it again and see if it was just nostalgia or was there really something in that movie. to my surprise, the movie held to my every expectations. it's a great movie. emotional in the right amount, some jokes, nice songs (not great though, and that actually explains why i did not remember it was a musical) and all in all a great use to my time. i was surprised because the last movies from my childhood that i have revisited did not even pass my minimal demands of a decent movie and yet this movie, which i first saw in the second grade, made me cry today just like it made me cry then. maybe that's because my dog died recently and maybe not, but the important thing is that it made me feel, and that's why filmmakers make films (that and the money, of course). yes, there are continuity glitches. yes, the script has holes, but it doesn't matter. the movie itself is fun and smart. so don't be fooled by cynical people who always look for the bad things in life, because nothing is perfect, and this movie gets a 10 not because it is perfect. it gets 10 simply because it made me feel.",1
"in order to stop her homosexual friend albert (perry king) from being deported back to belgium, stella (meg foster) decides to marry him. the only other problem with that is that stella herself is a lesbian. the two have their separate lives when one night after albert's birthday party, they fall into bed and then into love. later in the film after falling in love, stella suspects albert of cheating and shows up at his job one night late after closing. what she finds will leave the viewer stunned. this is a great film, very original. perry king and meg foster are so good in their roles that it is amazing that they were not better recognized for their work here. very controversial upon its release in 1978, the ""r"" rated film is now ""pg"" in this much more liberal time.  recently released on dvd, the disc contains a ""making of"" segment on the special features and in it it's stated that the film was based on an actual story so the viewers who say the film is not ""real"" are mistaken. everyone is an individual and different people fall in love for different reasons-these are the issues explored in this wonderful film for everyone who has ever loved!",1
"welcome to collinwood is a lot of things, but it is none of the following:  a george clooney star vehicle unfunny un-original  and yes i know, the basis for the movie is another movie. but as far as hollywood goes, this may rank with their most authentic outputs this decade - and for me, it does.  the movie is from start to finish, an absolute gas. here's why.  there isn't a bad performance in the film. the funny parts are funny. the edgy parts are edgy. the script contains, not a dull moment of dialogue the cinematography is fresh and yes beautiful. and it doesn't conform to the hollywood norm (you'll see what i mean, when you see the film)  when i was a kid, i remember seeing advertisements for the film. this film went under the radar after not grossing much at the box office, and isn't even a cult classic. the reason why transformers 2, is seen as acceptable by average movie goers, is because they are used to seeing transformers 2. if film's as original and funny as this were pumped out as often as multi-million pieces of s**t, the cinematic experience would be a much fresher place -   when 'they' say they don't make em like they used to, 'they' didn't see welcome to collinwood.  a fun, mini-masterpiece of caper comedy, that refuses to compromise. one of my favourites.",1
"i would have to say that this is the first quality romantic-comedy i have ever seen. it had depth and although you knew from the beginning who was going to end up together there was still longing and anticipation. the thought that maybe they won't get together... it is an indie film after all. this movie was well written, directed and acted. the dancing on the side of the road scene was magnificent.",1
"it must have been several years after it was released, so don't know why it was at the movies. but as a kid i enjoyed it. i just found a vhs tape of superman and the mole men at the flea market and decided to watch it again (it's been a lot of years). i wasn't expecting much, now knowing how the b movies were made at that time. but i was pleasantly surprised to find the movie very watchable and the acting by all outstanding. usual acting in these type movies leaves a lot to be desired. surprisingly, the writing wasn't bad either. forget the fact that superman went from sequence to sequence and could have kicked all their butts in the beginning, because then the story would have ended, right?! ok, the mole men costumes were hokey and not very scary (they didn't even scare me as a kid). however, making allowances for the probable low budget for background and costumes, it was a job well done by all. i recognized the sheriff right away as the old ranger from death valley days and plenty of supporting roles in tv westerns. j. farrell macdonald played old pop and was always a great supporting actor in more movies than i can count. walter reed and jeff corey were familiar faces as well from other movies. did you recognize the old doctor as the captain of the ship that went to get king kong? did you recognize the little girl rolling the ball to the mole men as lisbeth searcy in old yeller? some of the mole men were famous too. jerry maren has played mayor mccheese for mcdonalds, little oscar mayer, was the munchkin that handed dorothy the lollipop, was on a seifeld episode and a wealth of other work. billy curtis played an unforgettable part with clint eastwood in high plains drifter, was one of the friends met by the star in incredible shrinking man, he had a part in a movie i just luckily grabbed at a flea market titled my gal sal with rita hayworth, wizard of oz and plenty of other parts - great actor. john brambury was also a munchkin. phillis coates, who played lois lane in this movie, was without question wonderful in the part and george reeves as superman/clark kent was superman. he did a great job of playing the strong man. bottom line to all i've said is that this movie is worth watching because of the cast and writing in dealing with a pretty flimsy idea for a movie. but it was the 50's and anything was possible from intruders from outer space to mole men from inner space. it is definitely worth seeing, there isn't a bad actor in the group. whomever put the cast together was very, very fortunate to get so many gifted actors into a b type film. some already had a wealth of experience and some were about to obtain a wealth of experience - but all were gifted. so if you get a chance to see the film, forget the dopey costumes and just enjoy the excitement and acting. is it a bird? is it a plane? no, just a good, old fashioned movie to enjoy!",1
"i mean really. this is not going to help the australian film industry to make this kind of film with no values of any kind. okay, if you're a stoner and have nothing better to do, then maybe. i think film-makers from here should try to show the rest of the world what great talented people we have, and this is not the vehicle for it. come on now, this film is just tacky.",0
"not to be confused with the british black comedy of the same name that came out in 1994. but this shallow grave is a worthy addition to the 80's backwoods slasher.  the plot goes = 4 sorority girls from a convent are planning the spring break of a lifetime in florida, but they're plans are put on hold when one of them witness a man murdering a local woman, and when he realizes that he was seen, well let's just say it becomes a deadly game of cat and mouse and things get even worse when he turns out to be the local sheriff.  shallow grave in my opinion is one of the more enjoyable slashers that came out in the 80's, especially the late 80's which was when the slashers kinda went downhill, this was one of the few that didn't and this movie should be more well known, it's a pity it isn't. this is one film that actually confounds stereotypes (just try guessing who the final girl is going to be - i got it totally wrong). the principle cast are all likable and it's one of those movies that you kinda hope they all get away, which of course they don't. this, coupled with the fluffiness of the film's first half-an-hour jars (in a good way) with some flashes of real nastiness (the second murder provides a real jolt) and some unexpected sleaziness (even though this isn't a high budget thriller i didn't expect the topless scene where a woman is strangled with her own bra (accompanied by a hysterical religious radio broadcast), in a film from this late in the 80's).  there are one or two bad things about this movie, well not bad just minor, like the sub plot with the two teenage boys which doesn't go anywhere and the ending which was stupid and plus the deputy inability to follow logic. there aren't any sharp implements in shallow grave but, to my mind at least, it's a slasher flick through and through. the scenes where the girls are hunted through the woods by the malevolent sheriff are tense and exciting.  all in all a very enjoyable and worthwhile slasher, with great performances from all four of the main girls and that psycho sheriff.",1
"i had two reasons for watching this swashbuckler when it aired on danish television yesterday. first of all, i wanted to see gina lollobrigida - and here i wasn't disappointed. she looked gorgeous. second of all, through reading about the film i had gotten the impression that it featured absurd humor not unlike that which can be found in philippe de broca's films. on this account, however, i was sadly disappointed. i found the jokes predictable (apart from a few witty remarks on the topic of war) and the characters completely one-dimensional. also, the action scenes were done in a strangely mechanical and uninspired fashion, with no sense of drama at all. i kept watching until the end, but i got bored very quickly and just sat there, waiting for the scenes with lollobrigida.",0

"...that seem to be fooling people into seeing qualities in this film that are just not there.  near dark covered the same territory but with much more class, and action.  why the script kept their 'big secret' so long was a total mystery to me - i guessed it at the breakfast scene at the start of the film. by the time it was revealed to the viewer it was just a case of 'big deal, tell me something i don't know.'  i found this to be pointless movie that may have challenged the genre conventions, unfortunately those conventions are that horror films are tense and packed with genuine sense of horror. this was woeful",0
"the eight jean rollin film i have watched is also possibly the weirdest; the intriguing plot (such as it is) seems initially to be too flimsy to sustain even its trim 84 minutes but it somehow contrives to get inordinately muddled as it goes along! a would-be female vampire (scantily-clad, as promised by the title) is held in captivity inside a remote château and emerges only to 'feast' on the blood of willing victims (who are apparently members of a suicide club) as if unsure where all of this would lead him, the writer-director ultimately has the human villain  actually the blank-faced hero's kinky father  ludicrously revealed as a mutant(?!) from the future! the languorous pace and dream-like atmosphere (the cultists wear hoods and animal masks to hide their features from the sheltered girl) are, of course, typical of both the film-maker (ditto the seashore setting at the {anti}climax) and the ""euro-cult"" style, as are the bevy of nubile beauties on display. personally, the most enjoyable thing about the whole visually attractive but intellectually vacuous affair was watching familiar character actor bernard musson (who appeared in six latter-day luis bunuel films) crop up bemusedly through it from time to time!",0

"if bob ludlum was to see this mini series, he would have cried. this was complete waste of time and money. i have read the book and even though movies are not exactly what the book may be, cbs wasted time and money on this and it is embarrassing to claim that this was ludlum's work.  may be the creator should check out the bourne identity with richard chamberlain and see how good that tv series was.  poor mira, blair, anjelica and colm, why did they sign to stoop this low?  horrible!!",0
"the cult movie for every true russian intellectual. everything is brilliant, especially acting: it's beyond any praise. the movie, as the book, is full of symbols: my favorite one is the brightest symbol of razrukha (colloquial russian word for ""devastation"", often signifies the period of lifestyle chaos after the 1918-20 civil war) -- the wide-opened dirty door in the bricky wall squeaking in the snowy wind and the pitch-black hole of the doorway behind it.  now the film is released on dvd with fully restored image and the 5.1 sound, there are well-translated english subtitles too, though some obscene words of sharikov were replaced by the more mild versions in the translation. i don't know is that dvd available abroad but if you'll find it grab it immediately, it's really worthy of watching.  and, in conclusion, a fact: about the 50% of russians today, mostly youth, can be identified as sharikovs in a considerable degree. it's the post-soviet effect: soviet people appeared to be wholly unprepared for the informational attack of the western civilization, tv-producers and movie makers have made the entertainment industry and the mass media amazingly aggressive, soulless and thoughtless so that it abetted the darkest instincts of every russian. even among the internet users every third one uses the obscene language in forums and chats because it's amazingly common in colloquial speech.",1
"""handsome guys with bad haircuts !!"" ""beautiful girls without any clues !!"" ""stupid gangsters who cannot shoot straight !!"" from dragon dynasty comes the hong kong gangster drama, ""dragon heat."" for reasons which will probably forever be completely obscured, the production and casting call for this 'criminals-on-steroids' movie somehow got both maggie q and michael biehn to sign on as villains. but they don't get all that much to do in this horrid slug-fest.  they are two of the best contemporary actors around, each with their own resume' and list of accomplishments, and biehn in particular has had the courage to take some rather challenging and non-heroic roles.  maggie q was the super-bad ""mai"" in ""live free or die hard,"" so 'nuff said.  biehn is, of course, famous for being the soldier-from-the-future who made ""the terminator"" of 1984 such a believable science-fiction/fantasy romp, by crashing up against big arnold, who is now the governator of california !!   michael biehn is almost wholly wasted in this terrible train-wreck of a police drama. there is absolutely no reason for that, as the incredibly convoluted plot -- given mostly in chinese, as it is a hong kong story -- could have been better elaborated for non-chinese audiences with a foreign narrator.  in other words, if biehn had been used as something like an interpol observer or coordinator, or an agent under deep cover, who needs to get some 'splaining given to him every five or ten minutes, that would have been great. but no, he's brought in as a part of an odd group of special forces-type bad guys who seem to be freelancing their own corrupt deal, in the middle of somebody else's totally corrupt deal involving the local king of corrupt deals.   yes, there, i said it all. confused ? me too. ""welcome to the party, pal.""  in the truly superb hong kong crime drama, known by its english title as ""breaking news,"" there are also a number of fascinating characters at work, but there is only one story line in the plot.   bad guys vs. good cops. in this wretched and excessively violent foray into the world of a hong kong triad, or gang, it seems that the hot-shot police force is little more than a parade of ducks in a shooting gallery, the way the criminals mow them down.  so, not surprisingly, there's an almost otherwise incomprehensible scene ( several scenes, in fact ), where kids are trying to shoot wooden ducks in an arcade game, to win stuffed animal prizes. and so the hot shot good-guy police officers quite naturally intervene on their behalf, so that the arcade owner has to give up the kewpie dolls.  there's also a half-hearted attempt at creating a ""love interest"" between one of the 'visiting cops' and the sole female 'visiting cop'.  the visiting cops are supposed to be material witnesses against the triad gangster leader, who gets hijacked on the way to his court appearance, but not by his own team but by the mercenaries ( biehn, maggie q, and some others ). these killers all want something but we don't get to learn about what it is, until the very end of the film !! that was a stupid mistake inside of the overall story.  you cannot build suspense in a crime drama without something to obtain, or get, or get away from, being introduced very early in the story.  add to that some ""cut-away scenes"" done for purely artsy effects, all showing the bad-bad guys' and the regular bad guys' recent pasts, and any film buff can readily understand why this barking dog gets a 1 rating from this fan of all things cinematic with criminals and conspirators and hong kong.",0
"i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss.  it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub). it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.  the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. the relationship between heero and relena, and milliardo and noin are joys to watch. the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off.   and then there's the giant robot fighting. fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene. any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.  the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.",1
"i love morgan freeman. paz vega is an attractive, appealing and talented actress. i'm sure that this would have been a good movie had anything happened in it. nothing does. it's short (less than 90 minutes). it was 75 minutes too long. after an hour of frustration, i scanned through the remaining 20-odd minutes. excruciating.  freeman plays an actor - who hasn't worked in a while - researching a part that he might play, as a checkout clerk in a supermarket. he visits the supermarket where she works. nothing happens. she decides to give him a ride home and they go to an arby's, a target, a car wash. nothing happens. they converse about their lives. nothing happens. ever.  i don't get it. but i also don't get the bill murray flicks ""lost in translation"" and ""broken flowers"". if you like those movies, maybe you'll like this. lots of people find movies like this whimsical, charming, or - for reasons that escape me - find the dialog fascinating. a common device in movies of this ilk is to have a long take of stillness/silence after an actor delivers a line that's supposed to be meaningful. we know it's meaningful because it's followed by two minutes of nothing on the screen. sorry, i must be a philistine. i don't get it. to me, these kinds of movies aren't funny, or charming, or thought-provoking. they're just boring. why? because there's no comedy. no drama. no tension. no laughs. no suspense. no action. nothing to watch. in short, none of the things i go to the movies for. i can be bored for free. i see oddball/quirky characters in real life. i go to target, and fast-food restaurants, and car-washes. these elements do not a movie make, even if stars are doing this stuff. i pay to be entertained.  if you're crazy about morgan freeman and just like to hear him ramble on about nothing, have fun. if you wanna drool over paz vega, you can look and listen to her. but nothing happens, i promise. a total snoozefest.",0
"""ardh satya"" is one of the finest film ever made in indian cinema. directed by the great director govind nihalani, this one is the most successful hard hitting parallel cinema which also turned out to be a commercial success. even today, ardh satya is an inspiration for all leading directors of india.  the film tells the real-life scenario of mumbai police of the 70s. unlike any police of other cities in india, mumbai police encompasses a different system altogether. govind nihalani creates a very practical outlay with real life approach of mumbai police environment.  amongst various police officers & colleagues, the film describes the story of anand velankar, a young hot-blooded cop coming from a poor family. his father is a harsh police constable. anand himself suffers from his father's ideologies & incidences of his father's atrocities on his mother. anand's approach towards immediate action against crime, is an inert craving for his own job satisfaction. the film is here revolved in a plot wherein anand's constant efforts against crime are trampled by his seniors.this leads to frustrations, as he cannot achieve the desired job-satisfaction. resulting from the frustrations, his anger is expressed in excessive violence in the remand rooms & bars, also turning him to an alcoholic.  the spirit within him is still alive, as he constantly fights the system. he is aware of the system of the metro, where the police & politicians are a inertly associated by far end. his compromise towards unethical practice is negative. finally he gets suspended.  the direction is a master piece & thoroughly hard core. one of the best memorable scenes is when anand breaks in the underworld gangster rama shetty's house to arrest him, followed by short conversation which is fantastic. at many scenes, the film has hair-raising moments.  the practical approach of script is a major punch. alcoholism, corruption, political influence, courage, deceptions all are integral part of mumbai police even today. those aspects are dealt brilliantly.  finally, the films belongs to the one man show, om puri portraying anand velankar traversing through all his emotions absolutely brilliantly.",1
"here's my first david mamet directed film. fitting, since it was his first, as well.   the story here is uneven and it moves along like any con movie, from the little cons to the big cons to the all-encompassing con. it's like ""the grifters,"" but without that film's level of acting. (in that film, john cusack was sort of bland but that was the nature of his character.) the acting here is very flat (i sometimes wondered if the bland acting by crouse was supposed to be some sort of attack on psychoanalysis). at least in the beginning. it never gets really good, but it evolves beyond painfully stiff line reading after about ten minutes. early in the film, some of lindsay crouse's lines -- the way she reads them -- sound as if they're inner monologue or narration, which they aren't. with the arrival of mantegna things pick up.  the dialogue here isn't as fun as it should be. i was expecting crackerjack ring-a-ding-ding lines that roll off the tongue, but these ones don't. it all sounds very read, rather than spoken. maybe mamet evolved after this film and loosened up, but if not, then maybe he should let others direct his words. he's far too precious with them here and as a result, they lose their rhythmic, jazzy quality. what's more strange is that other than this, the film doesn't look or feel like a play. the camera is very cinematic. my only problem with ""glengarry glen ross"" was that it looked too much like filmed theatre, but in that film the actors were not only accomplished, but relaxed and free. everything flowed.  i wouldn't mind so much if it sounded like movie characters speaking movie lines -- or even play characters speaking play lines -- but here it sounds like movie (or even book) characters speaking play lines. it's a weird jumble of theatre and film that just doesn't work. that doesn't mean the movie is bad -- it isn't, it's often extremely entertaining. the best chunk is in the middle.  it's standard con movie stuff: the new guy (in this case, girl) margaret ford (lindsay crouse) gets involved in the seedy con underworld. how she gets involved is: she's a psychiatrist and one of her patients, billy is a compulsive gambler. she wants to help him out with his gambling debt, so she walks into the house of games, a dingy game room where con men work in a back room. i'll admit the setup is pretty improbable. (were they just expecting crouse to come in? were they expecting she'd write a cheque? was billy in on it? one of these questions is definitely answered by the end, however.)  and from here the cons are start to roll out. i found the beginning ones -- the little learner ones -- to be the most fun. we're getting a lesson in the art of the con as much as crouse is.   we see the ending coming, and then we didn't see the second ending coming, and then the real ending i didn't see coming but maybe you did. the ball just keeps bouncing back and forth and by the last scene in the movie we realize that the second crouse walked into the house of games she found her true calling.  i'm going to forgive the annoying opening, the improbable bits and the strange line-reading because there are many good things here. if the first part of the movie seems stagy, stick with it. after the half-hour mark it does really get a momentum going. if you want a fun con movie, then here she is. if you want mamet, go watch ""glengarry glen ross"" again -- james foley did him better.  ***",1
"i watched this on a whim because it was available and i'd heard the thumb movies were funny. this one was not. the majority of the jokes were based around ""geranium's"" physique and, in turn, kate winslet's. i think it's really pathetic of the the ""thumbtanic"" creators to stoop so low to make jabs at a respected actress just because she (heaven forbid) doesn't starve herself into the model of ideal modern beauty.  my favorite part was the line that goes something like, ""hey, i have a great idea! let's swim over to this makeshift raft that no one else seems to see!"" thirty seconds of amusement out of a 26 minute movie does not redeem its value.",0
"this film started out very promising with the story about a director who loses his sight and a blind woman who is bound to help him. however, somewhere in the middle it seemed like the script writers didn't know where to go from there.  one unbelievable event followed the next (russia must be very small because they are all bumping into each other all the time), the motivation of the female lead character comprehensible (why does she still follow him after they got off the ship? why doesn't she try to borrow a mobile phone on the ship to call somebody?), the side stories were completely ridiculous (was the story with the mother and the boyfriend supposed to be funny? and what was the story with the younger sister about?). still with all this seeming arbitrariness of the plot, the movie managed to be completely predictable.  the saddest thing about it is that there was a lot of potential. as i said, the idea of the film was good, the visuals and the score were very beautiful and the actors of the main characters were good, too. so this could have been a really good film... but it wasn't.",0
"the morbid catholic writer gerard reve (jeroen krabbé) that is homosexual, alcoholic and has frequent visions of death is invited to give a lecture in the literature club of vlissingen. while in the railway station in amsterdam, he feels a non-corresponded attraction to a handsome man that embarks in another train. gerard is introduced to the treasurer of the club and beautician christine halsslag (renée soutendijk), who is a wealthy widow that owns the beauty shop sphinx, and they have one night stand. on the next morning, gerard sees the picture of christine's boyfriend herman (thom hoffman) and he recognizes him as the man he saw in the train station. he suggests her to bring herman to her house to spend a couple of days together, but with the secret intention of seducing the man. christine travels to köln to bring her boyfriend and gerard stays alone in her house. he drinks whiskey and snoops her safe, finding three film reels with names of men; he decides to watch the footages and discover that christine had married the three guys and all of them died in tragic accidents. later gerard believes christine is a witch and question whether herman or him will be her doomed fourth husband.   the ambiguous ""the vierde man"" is another magnificent feature of paul verhoeven in his dutch phase. the story is supported by an excellent screenplay that uses catholic symbols to build the tension associated to smart dialogs; magnificent performance of jeroen krabbé in the role of a disturbed alcoholic writer; and stunning cinematography. the inconclusive resolution is open to interpretation like in many european movies that explore the common sense and intelligence of the viewers. there are mediocre directors that use front nudity of men to promote their films; however, paul verhoeven uses the nudity of gerard reve as part of the plot and never aggressive or seeking out sensationalism. last but not the least; the androgynous beauty of the sexy renée soutendijk perfectly fits to her role of a woman that attracts a gay writer. my vote is eight.  title (brazil): ""o 4o homem"" (""the 4th man"")",1

"with a tendency to repeat himself, wenders has been a consistent disappointment ever since he hit it big with 'paris texas'.  'land of plenty' is no exception. taking into the fact that i anticipated an average-mediocre film even before i went in, wenders' ambitions seem to always get the better of him. it's taken for grated now his films are heavy-handed and bombastic.  i weren't sure if i was watching a comedy that mocks middle america or some thriller. the outcome of diehl's character is wholly predicable. wender's insistence on layering many many scenes with some rock song is also intensely annoying. he was covering up the holes in his script and direction by jazzing up the scenes.  i am certain that many people will find this film important and resonant but in all honestly, this clumsy and didactic effort only speaks of poor direction.  interesting that wenders professed that while making 'paris texas', he had great help from sam sheppard with the script. yes, that was wenders' best and he should understand now he needs a good scriptwriter. his films from the past 15 years+ were a total mess.",0
"in this muppet movie, kermit, miss piggy, fozzie, gonzo, rowlf, scooter, camillia, dr. teeth, floyd, animal, janice, and zoot are college graduates who decide to bring their successful college musical, manhattan melodies, to broadway. unfortunately, no producer will even meet with the muppets. after being denied by too many producers, scooter suggests that the muppets decide to move on on their own. however, kermit still believes that he can get his show on broadway, but after he finally does and let's everybody know that he sold the show, kermit get's amnesia and the others don't know where he is.  this features many great scenes, including a live action sequence that introduced the muppet babies, a wedding sequence filled with muppets, including the sesame street cast and traveling matt (from fraggle rock), scooter as a movie theatre usher, and a scene where rizzo and the other rats cook breakfast.  my only complaint is that more characters weren't included more. sure, many of them appear at the wedding, but there should have been some significant roles for bunsen, beaker, beauregard, and sweetums, and lips should have been part of the electric mayhem in this movie like he was in the muppet show's last season and the great muppet caper, and miss piggys dog foo foo should have been with her as well (after all, rizzo the rat, also performed by steve whitmire, had a big part in this movie, and he wasn't very well-known at the time).",1
"i don't understand why people would praise this garbage. its wrong , stupid , unrealistic , awful , and just about everything else. the film is a view on life , racial issues , prejudice , and everything else that strangely goes on in college. this is where it fails. it has no grasps on reality. from many questionable non-sense scenes in the movie such as for example  a black man chasing down a white man with a gun, the black man and stopped by the security guards handcuffed and carried out while the gunman runs right past them.  the same white man snipering down people from a roof topic which is stopped and beaten down by the same black man is then stopped and given a rodney king style beating while the gun man runs free while a moment later being chased back down by only one of the four guards.  as one previous reviewer pointed out several white 230lbs men being beaten down by several black men weighing around 160lbs including the 105lbs bust a rhymes  another critical flaw in the film are the shallow uninteresting main characters. from the scared and confused white people and the mean , angry , and yet rightful (?) black people. its almost as its an insult to both black and white people. i am a white male and i know many black and hispanic people who agree that this movie is wrong to portray characters and giving them those characteristics exclusively due to their race.  the storyline which i will explain now revolves around three characters. one a black athlete , the other a confused scared white girl who questions her sexuality , and the third is a white man who is also confused and scared , then blames his problems on black people in which he becomes a nazi later in the film. they all have their share of problems and adventures including sex , rape , fights , love , hate , prejudice , racial war , and oh yeah don't forget education. which all comes down at the end for the fatal shoot out. in which after they go back to their boring lives and think ""being white is bad"". does this sound alot like your college years? didn't think so. i don't think the director attended college especially if he were to make this awful mess.  overall this is a really bad , bad , ugly movie. if you want to see a more accurate view or racial issues go see american history x. if you want to see a more accurate view of college rent porkys. just avoid this mess.",0

"and it falls squarely into the category of ""awesomely bad"" - ie a movie drunk students would rent to get a kick out of. i was at the sci fi movie festival and all i remember is a wave after wave of hysterical laughter as this movie premiered. other critiques will better describe this movie's fecal nature, and i felt oh-so-bad at the poor guy from the production company who had turned up, obviously to gauge the audience's reaction. what he got was the sci fi equivalent of a drunken student audience, and after a ""serious"" anime movie, i think it was ""sky blue"", the audience was in a sombre mood, and then this movie opened and within seconds everyone in the room was rolling in the isles. i will bullet point the worst parts;  script: the funniest, and worst part of this movie, it clunks along a linear and predictable road with the occasional ill-thought-out aside. rubbish, but eminently laughable.  animation: poorly done, and put together, if you can put up with drab backgrounds and gradually skimpier costumes for the heroine (i know i can!), then watch out for the montage where she ""trasforms"" from a swedish peasant girl into lady death!!!  characters: so one-dimensional its painful, there is a brief backstory (with side-splitting lines of dialogue) and little light is shone on the actual motivation behind some of the main characters.  so, in a nutshell, if you've got a captive audience and a few beverages lying around (try and make sure they're alcoholic to ease the pain), then slip this movie into the dvd and get in a ""mystery science theatre 3000"" mindset. there is no other motivation to watch this movie other than to laugh at it, and its not meant to be a comedy. do not watch this movie alone. it could possible be even more boring to watch solo than ""new world"" with colin farrell as you won't be able to have a laugh at the ridiculousness with a friend or two.",0

"perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all indian films - pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with bollywood film (ie tackiness, farce, wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themes/genres). pakeezah is indigenous to the sub-continent and authentic, almost madam butterfly-like in plot. characters are well-developed, direction, although sometimes unrefined by today's standards, perceptive and convincing. the urdu-speaking milieux at the time of pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age! the acting (particularly the 'looks' and the dynamic between characters) are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of muslim india.  coupled, with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score, enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical indian dance (kathak). as is the case with most romantic tragedies, the heroine must die, but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling he/she has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience. pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled.",1
"i've seen this movie after watching paltrow's version. i've found that one a very good one, and i thought this would not be as good... but i was wrong: british version was far better and enjoyable! i found jeremy northam more ""agreeable"" than mark strong, but i can say that strong catches much better austen's knightley. anyway, both versions are good,but anyone that loved austen's books, should watch this movie. i agree with *caalling*: andrew davies changed a few things, but still remains faithful to the original.  10 out of 10  my 2 cents!",1

"i knew absolutely nothing about chocolat before my viewing of it. i didn't know anything about the story, the cast, the director, or anything about the film's history. all i knew was it was a highly-acclaimed french film. had i known more, i probably wouldn't have viewed the picture with an open mind. on paper, the premise doesn't sound interesting to me. had i known what chocolat was about ahead of time, my interest while watching would have been limited. however, not knowing about the story helped me enjoy it. throughout, i had no clue has to where the story would go, what the characters would do, and what the end result would be. it was, if nothing else, not a predictable film. indeed, it could have been as the story is told in flashbacks. telling a story in flashbacks is often a risky move on the part of the filmmakers. since the lead character is seen in present day, the audience knows she will remain alive. by using the flashback technique, director claire denis is able to ensure the audience that the young girl makes it to adulthood without any serious physical damage, giving the viewer the sense that chocolat is a story more about emotions than what is on the outside. a lesser filmmaker would give france a haggard-looking face, one that screams of a confused and unusual childhood. instead, denis presents france as a beautiful girl, someone who looks fine on the outside.   it could be argued that chocolat is more about france's mother since she is given far more screen time, though i believe it is ultimately about france. to me, what chocolat is really about is how a mother's actions affect her daughter. it is about how parents' behavior stays with their offspring. france is not ruined by her mother's actions in the story, yet her mother's actions clearly made an impression on france. had france not been affected at all by her mother's actions, the flashback aspect would be irrelevant.   for a movie that deals with two time periods, the past and the present, chocolat was a very well paced, there were no scene of excess fat. none of the scenes felt gratuitous or out of the place. the film had nice rhythm, the editing crisp, leaving only what was necessary to tell the story. with a well told story, solid editing, and organized directing, chocolat is one of the better french films i have seen. it was responsible for launching claire denis' career and with good reason: it's an incredible directorial debut.",1
"well, first off, if you're checking out revolt of the zombies as some very early night of the living dead (1968)-type film, forget it. this is about ""zombies"" in a more psychological sense, where that term merely denotes someone who is not in control of their will, but who must instead follow the will of another. the ""zombies"" here, as little as they are in the film, are largely metaphors for subservience to the state or authority in general, as in wartime. it is quite a stretch to call this a horror film.  the film is set during world war i. a ""french cambodian"" contingent had heard strange stories about zombification--supposedly angkor wat was built by utilizing zombies--and there are tales of zombie armies easily overcoming foes. armand louque (dean jagger) brings back a priest who supposedly knows the secret of zombification, but he won't talk. so louque and an international military contingent head to angkor wat on an archaeological expedition designed to discover the secret of zombification and destroy the information before zombies have a chance to ""wipe out the white race"".  one of the odd things about revolt of the zombies is that it seems like maybe writer/director victor halperin decided to change his game plan while shooting the script. the film begins as if it will explore the zombie/military metaphor, and maybe even have adventure elements, but after about 15 minutes, it changes gears and becomes more of a love triangle story.  halperin does stick with a subtext about will and power (and a nietzschean ""will to power""). the film is interesting on that level, but the script and the editing are very choppy. this is yet another older film for which i wouldn't be surprised if there is missing footage, especially since some scenes even fade or cut while a character is uttering dialogue.  amidst the contrived romance story, halperin tries to keep referring to the zombie thread, but little of the zombie material makes much sense. louque discovers the secret of zombification, but it doesn't mean much to the viewer. the mechanics of the zombie material are vague and confusinghalperin even resorts to using superimposed footage of bela lugosi's googly-eyes from his 1932 film, white zombie, but never explains what it has to do with anything. there are big gaps in the plot, including the love story. promising, interesting characters from early reels disappear for long periods of time. one potential villain is disposed of unceremoniously before he gets to do much.  if you're a big fan of old, creaky b movies, revolt of the zombies may be worth watching at least once--the acting isn't all that bad, and if you've got a good imagination, you can piece together an interesting story in your mind to fill in all of the gaps. but this is the second time i've seen the film, with the first only being about five years ago, and i could barely recall anything about it--so it's not exactly memorable.",0

"i found a dvd of ""i dream of jeanie"" in the $1.00 bin at wal-mart. when i saw that it was the ""story of stephen foster"", being a musician and music educator, i had to see it. i had no idea what year it was made for it did not say on the cover, just that it was a remake of 1939's ""sewanee river"". bill shirley's portrayal of the composer is sometimes painful, sometimes laughable. the man has no testosterone and is a wimp all the way through! i have a difficult time believing stephen foster thought music publishers were doing him a favor by publishing his songs...without paying him for them! in addition to that ridiculous notion, there is a nearly 20 minute segment of ray middleton and his black-faced ""christy minstrels"" performing stephen foster's songs that was difficult to watch, to say the least. i can hardly believe anyone would consider this movie appropriate to resurrect in our current time. it is an embarrassment and should remain forgotten. fortunately, stephen foster's songs will never be forgotten....also, eileen christy's portrayal of jeanie was certainly the highest point in this lowest point of hollywood history.",0
"this is quite possibly the worst christmas film ever. the plot is virtually non-existent, the acting (affleck in particular) is poor at best. ben affleck fans will probably defend this film but deep down they must agree. as far as i could gather the plot consisted of ben affleck, a millionaire salesman, is told by a shrink to go to a place that reminds him of his childhood and burn a list of things he wanted to forget from his childhood. on doing this he ends up paying the family currently living in the house to be his family for christmas... and that is it. the film goes on and eventually he gets together with the daughter of the family.... blah blah blah.",0

"wow!   this film is the best living testament, i think, of what happened on 9-11-01 in nyc, compared to anything shown by the major media outlets.  those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside. this film shows you what happened on the inside.   it begins with a focus on a rookie new york fireman, waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight. the subject matter turns abruptly with the only existing footage of the first plane to hit the towers. you are then given a front-row seat as firefighters rush to the scene, into the lobby of tower one.   in the minutes that precede the crash of the second plane, and tower two's subsequent fall, you see firemen reacting to the unsettling sound of people landing above the lobby. it is a sight you will not soon forget.  heart-rending, tear-jerking, and very compelling from the first minute to the last, ""9/11"" deserves to go down in history as one of the best documentary films ever made.  we must never forget.

"plague replaces femme fatale in this highly suspenseful noir shot in new orleans by director elia kazan. kazan as always gets fine performances from his actors but also shows a visual flair for claustrophobic suspense with a combination of tight compositions and stunning single shot chase scenes.   a man entering the country illegally is killed after a card game. it turns out he has a form of bubonic plague so it remains crucial not only to arrest the killers but to find an inoculate all those who have had contact. city and health officials implement a plan of secrecy rather than alert the community for fear the culprits will flee the city and spread the disease. a detective and an epidemiologist up against the clock form an uneasy alliance as they comb the waterfront employing their contrasting investigatory styles.   streets raises a huge ethical question about the publics right to know as the medical officer argues for a media blackout thus possibly creating a greater risk to the community. regardless of outcome, you still may find yourself second guessing the actions of the the film's protagonist.   richard widmark as dr.clint reed and paul douglas as detective warren display short tempers and grudging respect for each other in their search for the killers. barbera bel geddis as reed's wife has some good moments with widmark in some domestic scenes that bring the right touch of (restful more than comic) relief from the tensions of the desperate search amid the grim environs of the new orleans waterfront impressively lensed by cinematographer joe mcdonald. zero mostel as a small time criminal is slimy and reprehensible but at times sympathetic. walter jack palance as the skeletal blackie (black death?) is simply outstanding. with riveting intensity palance dominates every scene he is in not only with ample threat but disturbing charm as well. in addition he displays a formidable athleticism that allows for a more suspenseful continuity, especially in the film's powerful final allegorical moments.   panic in the streets is probably kazan's best non-brando film. it's tension filled, suspensefully well paced and edited. it's ambient on locale setting lends a sense of heightened reality that allows kazan the flexibility to display his visual style beyond the movie stage and with panic he succeeds with aplomb.",1

"this movie was so bad it was laughable. i couldn't resist watching it though. the plot is standard, the acting quite horrible (supporting cast such as the nutty neighbor and the lawyer friend were better actors). kind of amusing if you have some time to waste and like seeing the conclusion to a dramatic plot.  the headliner who plays ""kathy"" was just fascinating because i couldn't decide if her deadpan, flat affect was the result of bad surgery or simply bad acting (i decided it was both). this leaves the script to comment on, which was pretty awful. pat remarks, idiotic decisions, and reckless stupidity on the part of every character in the movie. maybe this is what was so riveting; i don't know. i just watched it to see how bad it could be. (actually the dialog doesn't even qualify to be called ""cliche'"" - but it's almost completely inane.)  all in all, very bad, cheaply made movie. the sets, the same scenes (a house, a building) were shown over and over with no artistry or actual tie-in to the action; more like props that were randomly dropped into the action in a bad play. a chase scene could have been shot by any juvenile in a warehouse or an old school: poorly shot, cheap props, minimal action.... and i still wanted to see the ending. go figure.",0

"who knew? dowdy queen victoria, the plump monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, prince albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'the young victoria' not only chronicles the young queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.  the act i 'set-up' draws you in right away. following the death of victoria's father, the duke of kent in 1820, less than a year after victoria's birth, the duchess of kent eventually hooked up with former army officer john conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. conroy insisted that victoria be raised under the atrocious 'kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. what's more, victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became queen.  the film explains that in 1830 parliament passed the regency act, which established that victoria's mother would become regent (and hence guardian) in the event that victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. during this time, the duchess and conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making conroy her private secretary and treasurer. strong-willed victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. the duchess disliked king william as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the monarchy; the king felt the duchess disrespected his wife. as a result, the duchess attempted to limit victoria's contact with the king. in an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the king berated the duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.  king william kept his word and died a short time after victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. they were both banished to a secluded apartment in buckingham palace and for a number of years victoria had little contact with her mother.  'the young victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding victoria's coronation as queen. a good part of the film deals with victoria's relationship with lord melbourne, the whig party prime minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. in the beginning melbourne gains the young queen's trust and they become good friends. in the early years of her reign, she sees melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. in reality, melbourne was more a father figure to victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the prime minister and prince albert, as though they were romantic rivals.  the plot thickens when melbourne is forced out and the queen must commission sir robert peel, of the more conservative tory party, as the new prime minister. the film chronicles the events of 'the bedchamber crisis' in which peel resigned after victoria refused to replace some of her bedchamber ladies with the wives of tory politicians. the film leaves out another scandal which involved a lady hastings, one of the duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with john conroy and becoming pregnant by him. because of her hatred for conroy, victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about hastings' alleged pregnancy. as it turned out, hastings only appeared pregnantwhat she actually had was an abdominal tumor. victoria's inexperience shows during the bedchamber crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the hastings affair.  the rest of the 'the young victoria' deals with -- of course -- the romance between the queen and prince albert. victoria kept albert waiting, as the film makes clear, since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new sovereign. they spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until albert returned to england and gave victoria support during the trying times of the bedchamber crisis.  i find a good number of parallels between prince albert and prince philip, the current queen's husband. while philip is mainly danish, he went to school in germany and had in-laws who were of german background. both albert and philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the court (there's a great scene where albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for king george iii even though he had been dead for years!). albert's struggle was the same for philipas husbands of monarchs, they had to find something to do. both albert and philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever-popular wives.  fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where albert infuriates victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs. albert doesn't want a second 'bedchamber crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving victoria's bedchamber ladies. victoria is barely talking to albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down (in the film albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).  the performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, emily blunt and rupert friend. the young victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of victoria's depression after albert's death). but 'victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.",1

"the key to the joy and beauty, the pain and sadness of life is our ability to accept that life basically is what it is so we don't constantly struggle against that single compelling truth. in so doing, we find peace. elegant in its simplicity but so hard for most of us to grasp.  in this film, the director shows us this truth but allows us to discover it in our own way. this is a beautiful yet simple story, more of a fable, which is played very well. watching the actors is more like being in a room with real people than it is just watching actors.  i struggled with how to write a review of this fine film so others would be motivated to see it. i'm at a loss. the story is about men in a bath house. sounds like a real turn off, right? but, nothing could be farther from the truth. the american title for this film is the shower but that is almost an antithesis to a major thematic element in this film, which is the bath. i'm still at a loss. talking about the story or the characters will not do them justice.  so, i'll just tell you how much i enjoyed watching this movie and how touching and moving the experience was. i was also quite entertained. i cared deeply for the characters and i cared deeply about what happened to them. for any story, that is the highest form of praise.  if you were moved by movies like the king of masks or not one less, then make sure you see the shower. netflix has it and the dvd video and sound quality are excellent. i watched it in the original lanquage with well done and well placed english subs.

"saxophonist ronnie bowers (dick powell) wins a studio contract and goes to hollywood. he stays at hollywwod hotel (of course). at the same time big egotistical star mona marshall (lola lane) has a tantrum and refuses to attend the premiere of her new picture. in a panic the studio hires lookalike virginia (rosemary lane) to impersonate her and have bowers take her to the premiere not telling him it's not marshall. naturally they fall in love. you can pretty much figure out the rest of the plot yourself.  the plot is old (to put it nicely) but powell and rosemary lane make a very likable pair and have beautiful singing voices. the score is good (highlighted by ""hooray for hollywood"") and director busby berkeley shows off his unique visuals in a really fun drive-in musical sequence (with edgar kennedy doing his patented slow burn). also glenda farrell has a few funny bits as monas sister jonesie.  still the movie isn't that good. the rest of the cast mugs ferociously and most of the humor is just not funny. lola lane especially is just lousy trying to play mona for comedy. also there is racism--a stereotypical black maid is played for laughs and there's some truly appalling racist ""humor"" at one point. that's probably what keeps this off tv most of the time. i realize it was accepted at the time but it comes across as revolting today.  all in all a so-so movie with some serious problems helped by a good cast and some great songs. i give it a 7.",1

"sharp, well-made documentary focusing on mardi gras beads. i have always liked this approach to film-making - communicate ideas about a larger, more complex, and often inscrutable phenomenon by breaking the issue down into something familiar and close to home.  i am sure most people have heard stories about sweatshops and understand the basic motives behind profit and capitalism, and globalism's effect on poorer nations (however people feel about it). rather than expound on these subjects and get up on a soapbox (not that there's anything wrong with that, other than such documentaries typically preach to the converted), this documentary simply shows mardi gras beads, how they are manufactured, by what people, and under what conditions, and then how they are utilized by consumers at the end of the process. it openly and starkly investigates the motivations of everyone involved in the process, including workers, factory management, american importers, and finally, the consumer at the end of the chain.  i felt a little sickened by this; equally by the mardi gras revelers, but also by the way the workers in china have accepted their situation as normal and par for the course (even if they have some objections to the details of how they are managed). the footage of the street sweepers cleaning up the beads off the streets at the end, made a particular impression. but that was just my reaction; i can see how someone else might read this documentary a little differently.  unlike other documentaries on this subject, i don't think you have to have any specific political opinion to be affected by this. this is ultimately a story about human beings and our relation to the goods we produce and consume. if you have ever bought a product made in the far east, this should give you something to think about.  outstanding and highly recommended. need to see more documentaries like this. kudos to all of those involved in the making of this film.",1

this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out. that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie don't make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges ending always there's 1 enemy left! ok damn it this movie sucks i can 't believe it i loved it when my lil bro got freaked from the attacks stomach takin out and the blood ya,0
"somebody needs to send this uli lommel guy back to movie school. who ever told him he knew how to make a movie? can just anybody make movies these days? in the past, it always required talent before someone could make a movie. after watching this lame btk movie and the others he's made, it seems blatantly obvious that the poor guy has about as much business making movies as i do. actually i think even i could make better movies than uli lame-all. this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the btk killer, other than the names of the victims and the killer. that's it. where did this guy get the big idea that btk killed people with rodents and all the other preposterous crap that's in the movie? this is a classic example of someone trying to lure people into watching their movie based on the term ""btk"" because of the fame it has achieved. absolutely pitiful. the only serial killer movie i would consider worse is that lame ""dahmer"" movie. that kid smoked so many cigarettes it made me nauseous. whoever made that one needs to be shot.",0
"noel coward,a witty and urbane man,was friends with louis mountbatten.mr coward,a long-time admirer of all things naval,was commissioned to write a story loosely based on the loss of mountbatten's ship.in a peculiarly british way it was considered that a film about the royal navy losing an encounter at sea would be good propaganda.it was also considered a good idea to have mr coward play the part of the ship's captain.amang the many qualities needed to command a fighting ship,the ability to speak in a very clipped voice and sing sophisticated ""point"" songs does not come very high up the list at admiralty house,or at least one would hope not.a captain must earn and retain the respect of the wardroom and the lower deck alike. mr coward might have had the respect of the gentlemen of the chorus at drury lane and binkie beaumont might have been terrified of him but his ability to tame,mould and direct a ship's crew in wartime must be brought into question.he folds himself languorously around the bridge,patronising the other ranks and barking orders at the officers,he only needed a silk dressing gown and a cigarette holder to seem right at home. much is made of the ""warship as a microcosm of british society""theme,and the crew largely comprises of the usual cheery cockneys,canny northerners etc.without whom no war can be fought.they spend most of their time on board smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up. never mind,there's plenty more where they came from.once ashore they go straight to the pub where they spend most of their time smoking,moaning about lord haw haw and getting blown up .by contrast mr coward lives in a dream cottage with a rose covered door somewhere very quiet with very little chance of getting blown up.he,his lady wife and their two rosy cheeked cherubs converse in ludicrously convoluted tones and said lady wife spends much of her time knitting things for the poor unfortunates who comprise his crew and who she refers to by their surnames.that nice young master johnny mills has a prominent role as a completely unbelievable lower deck type who worships mr coward in much the same way as a thrashed dog will worship its master.he marries his girlfriend after kissing her on the cheek,presumably on the grounds that she might be pregnant after such unfettered passion. so yes,we do have a microcosm of british society here,but perhaps not in the way the makers of ""in which we serve"" intended. at the end mr coward gets one last chance to patronise his men as the few survivors shuffle past him,""goodbye edwards,it was a privilege to sail with you""he enunciates as if he was reciting ""how now brown cow"". it may have been david lean's feature debut,but the hand of noel coward looms large right across this picture.he was a funny and clever man,better suited to writing waspish plays about poor little rich girls and boys interspersed with the occasional wry song.he had a talent to amuse,no doubt,but he could neither write nor speak convincing dialogue. being noel coward was a full-time job,he had no time to be a real person.",0
"this movie is bad. i don't just mean 'bad' as in; ""oh the script was bad"", or; ""the acting in that scene was bad"".....i mean bad as in someone should be held criminally accountable for foisting this unmitigated pile of steaming crud onto an unsuspecting public. i won't even dignify it with an explanation of the (plot??) if i can refer to it as that.i can think of only one other occasion in some 40-odd years of movie watching that i have found need to vent my spleen on a movie. i mean, after all, no one goes out to intentionally make a bad movie, do they? well, yes. apparently they do...and the guilty man is writer/director ulli lommel. but the worst of it is that blockbusters is actually renting this to their customers! be advised. leave this crap where it belongs. stuck on the shelf, gathering dust.",0
"once again jet li brings his charismatic presence to the movie screen in the film black mask. in this film li plays tsui, an escapee from a super soldier program who seeks to regain the humanity that the program had taken away from him. to do this tsui decides to become a librarian in order to live a normal and peaceful life, but fate demands that he clean up problems from his past before he can continue to seek peace. other members of the super soldier program had escaped at the same time as tsui, but they want to get even with the world rather than find inner peace. thus tsui becomes the only thing that can prevent his former team mates from releasing information that could cost many innocent people their lives. this film screams across the screen at a frantic pace and never lets its audience go. the martial arts is amazing, but because it uses wires it may not be appreciated as much as it deserves by american audiences. if you like action movies that have an interesting story and demand good acting performances because they deal with psychological as well as physical conflicts, then black mask is for you. i am glad to see that some of jet li's movies are finally getting main stream release in the united states and look forward to seeing how the changes that that release will require (things like dubbing and soundtrack) will affect the film. this is one of li's best films, go out and see it on may 14 when it is released in america.",1
"the same night that i watched this i also watched ""scary movie 4,"" making for one messed up double feature. unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the scary movie franchise. while i fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid, brutally dated and brutally bad, the more recent parody had me laughing out loud. how could i desire any more than that. director john de bello uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers. but his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day. the script reeks of stoner humor, and perhaps if you take illegal substances with your movie nights this could be your cup of tea. i, sober, was stuck watching a grown man go under cover as a tomato. and that one joke, that is never funny, where the discrepancy between the japanese speaking actor and the voice over is also here. some may giggle, i did not. they even had a hitler joke that wasn't funny, and i thought all hitler jokes were funny.  the narrative of this film is so splintered (for no good reason) that it is nearly impossible to explain. tomatoes kill people, the government tries to stop it, bad jokes are told. their aim may have been correct as their targets include the media, consumerism, and paranoia (three things that still control our lives today). oddly enough the main selling point of this film, those gosh darn tomatoes, really don't make much of an appearance. and when they do, get this, they're played by real tomatoes. that washed up gimmick did nothing for me as i get very little out of watching a pack of tomatoes devour a body thanks to the magic of stop action camera tricks. there is also a fear of going for broke at work here that prevents this film from being truly funny. the gag of having somebody fall asleep in nearly every scene may please some audience members, but more than likely it will be seen as an invitation to join in the fun.  i might also add that there does seem to be some old fashioned human egotism at work here. man eats tomato and that's dinner, tomato eats man and that is a worldwide catastrophe. but that is just the way the world works. in the film the produce becomes evil because of genetic modification, but in the real world our produce (see: taco bell) becomes evil thanks to neglect. and like those evil doin' green onions this film's shelf life expired a long time ago. there are a few good chuckles to be had. the last shot was really quite splendid, but it was nowhere near enough to save this moderate stink bomb. i'm pretty sure there is a good movie buried deep within this concept, but the script needed to be filtered through about a dozen rewrites to get there. and by ""there"" i mean to the level of ""scary movie 4."" **1/4",0
"when i remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it. it was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview, its stunning, and then when it comes out, you hear nothing and totally miss it, and your memory totally doesn't correct the mistake of missing it. man on fire was one of those movies. i was curious on a rental one time, and i decided to take it home with me, my precious blockbuster rental in my hands. i watched it, and witnessed such a beautiful movie. it is like none other...drama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular. the cinematography done by tony scott is extremely well done and unique, unlike another movie. the subtitles can explain something without even listening to the actual voices, and the music is very intriguing for the setting. i got into this movie, and ended up buying it as soon as i could scurry out of the household and head over to best buy. i've watched it several times now. denzel washington (creasy) does an amazing job with becoming this lost-minded ex-special forces man with no reason to live. dakota fanning (pita) puts life back into him with her undying love for him right from the start. they bond and become good friends, until she is kidnapped by notorious gangsters part of the brotherhood, la hermandad. creasy (denzel) tells the mother of dakota fanning that he will hunt down the killers, fearing that pita is dead. this is where creasy really shows the person he can become. he uses his contacts from pita's kidnapping and creasy's hospitalization to find one of the men and he begins his pursuit. my favorite line of all, is in this movie, when christopher walken tells the afi agent that ""a man is a work of art, in anything that he does....cooking, whatever. creasy's art is death...he's about to paint his masterpiece."" he plays a very unique roll of creasy's old partner and friend. after finally pursuing the brother of ""the voice,"" leader of la hermandad. creasy arranges a meeting to trade pita for himself and the voice's brother. in the end, creasy dies from being shot earlier, and his wound getting infected and massive blood loss. it is a very sincere and sad ending, but a great one. i love this movie and recommend it to anyone that is looking for a memorable flick. the story is in depth, everything is explained from beginning to end, and nothing corny at all in any way or manner.",1
"this drama is unlike sex and the city, where the women have a few drinks and share their sexual encounters with each other. its much more personal and people can relate to it. its much more engaging and emotional on a new level than other dramas focusing on women and their lives like ""sex and the city, lipstick jungle....""   dr. katie roden, is a psychologist with a dark secret, she seems much more depressed and guilt ridden than the rest of her 3 friends. she is dealing with the death of her former lover who was her patient while tackling his son's advances on her. her sombre clothes and empty and cold house convey her inside emotions very well.   trudi malloy, a widow is battling issues with ""letting go"" of her dead husband from 9/11. and when a handsome stranger, richard shows an interest in her she is suddenly forced to do a reality check by her friends who suggest that she gets back into dating business. the ridiculous and embarrassing courting scenes between richard and trudi are totally funny! it is interesting to note that richard asks her out the day she gets a millions from the 9/11 board for her husband's death..lets see what his intentions are   siobhan dillon, a lawyer is fed up of her husband's love making tactics which only involve ""baby making"" (as they are having trouble conceiving) and she quickly falls for her colleague who offer his ""services"" a little too willingly to her and she does not hesitate for long!it will interesting to see whether she will continue her affair or patch up with her husband (played by raza jeffrey) jessica, a real estate business woman is single and is straight, until she organizes a lesbian wedding and has an affair with one of them. her character is shown as a bold and provocative woman who before her lesbian encounter is having sex with a ""married man"", her colleague. lets see where her character venture to....  the beauty of this drama is that we are shown 4 totally different women with different scenarios, whose ambitions and inhibitions are shown. its also a good thing that the drama reveals the fact that sometimes friends lie to each other to be ""safe""!",1

"director jonathan lynn has made some underrated comedies in the past, like 'greedy' and 'clue'. this isn't one of them. more akin to a 'police academy' film than its inspiration, it stars steve martin in the old phil silvers role as an army sergeant forever pulling scams under the nose of his superiors. but the idyllic life of bilko and his lazy platoon looks shaky when an old enemy visits the base determined to catch bilko in the act. nothing much happens, really. it's all quite dull. it's not very funny. martin, dan aykroyd and phil hartman squeeze a couple of laughs out through sheer effort, but they're all better than this and it's quite painful watching them work with such thin material.",0
"""panic"" is a captivating, blurred-genre film about a brooding and conflicted middle aged hitman's reconciliation of infatuation with a younger uninhibited hairstylist, his love of wife and son, his duty to his employer/father with his own identity. although the film has a nebulous purpose and an ambiguous ending, it is a superb production in almost all aspects. the characters' clarity and sincerity in such an improbable story may both fascinate and annoy audiences.",1
"cinderella was one of the first movies i ever saw, and to me it is timeless. it is a lovely looking film, with gorgeous animation. my favourite animation scene was the dress scene- i just love those mice. the songs are also lovely, not as good as snow white's, but they are a delight to sing, and are reminiscent of tchaikovsky. a dream is a wish and so this is love? are standouts. the characters are also a delight. cinderella is idealistic and strong, and the mice provided great comic relief. the stepsisters were also well done, as well as lucifer. but i loved the stepmother the best, she was really evil, in comparison to a great character in the name of the fairy godmother. it is true, the movie drags slightly, with the antics of the mice, but they were genuinely funny, so i don't care. i don't think it is overrated, underrated don't you mean? it rarely plays on television, but the really bad sequel does on cinemagic on a regular basis. if you want a great cinderella adaptation, try the wonderful ever after, or the lavish slipper and the rose, which isn't as good. but whatever you do, avoid the sequel, which i have the mistake of owning, because you'll thank me. 9/10. bethany cox",1

"i just watched i. q. again tonight and had forgotten how much i love this movie. it is wonderfully entertaining and leaves you feeling that all is right with the world. i love the allusions to mozart all throughout from the opening with ""einstein"" playing ""twinkle, twinkle little star"" on the violin to him humming eine kleine nachtmusik during the iq testing of the ed walters. i love that a woman is portrayed as intelligent and encouraged to have a career, an especially unique situation for the 1950's, the time in which this movie is set. (i myself have been a teacher but stayed at home to raise my children, so please don't think i am some staunch women's libber.) it's wonderful how a man who is ""only a grease monkey"" is finally seen to be just as important and worthy as catherine's fiance, a clinical behavioral researcher. the message to me is that we are not what we do, but who we are is defined by so much more - no labels. there are so many little gags and one-liners that are almost throwaways if you don't watch and listen carefully.  i did catch a few things in the movie that are not listed on the goofs page. in the scene when ed walters is to speak at symposium, there are 3 instruments (protractor, ruler, etc.) hanging on the right from the chalk ledge. in the next camera shot, there only 2. in the credits on our video, it lists tony shaloub's character as bob watters, not bob rosetti as he introduces himself in the movie and is listed here on imdb.  i highly recommend this movie. it may be a piece of fluff in some estimations, but has lots more substance than many give it credit for. not only that, what a great cast is assembled here. watch it and enjoy!",1
"this was an absolutely terrible movie. don't be lured in by christopher walken or michael ironside. both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. this movie is an early nineties us propaganda piece. the most pathetic scenes were those when the columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. maria conchita alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. i am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like christopher walken's good name. i could barely sit through it.",0
"two years passed and mostly everyone looks different, some for good and some for worse. i still enjoyed as much as i did the original though.  some flaws they had though like changing the joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils, hes still voiced by mark hamill which is a plus i guess. they made poison ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and catwomen looks much different and not as ""attractive"" as she was in the original.  though costumes like batman, batgirl, killer croc and scarecrow look badass, especially scarecrow.  the show isn't as dark as the original because batman doesn't work as alone as he used to. most of the time working with batgirl and the new robin, tim drake. while nightwing(dick grayson) comes to the rescue often. batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of ass.  the show isn't as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite. ""over the edge"" might be one of the greatest batman episodes ever so make sure you check that out.  overall 8-9/10",1
"the question of whether or not one likes this film version of ""the ghost train"" invariably depends on one thing and one thing alone: your reaction to the performance of arthur askey.  he tends to steal almost every scene he's in, and not always in a good way. sometimes you wish he'd settle down or back off just a little, to allow the plot's many characters to feature and develop (which they do to some extent). but somehow everything keeps pointing back to askey's tommy gander character.  personally i like the film, and even like askey to an extent. i always seem to plonk it into the vcr at those odd hours of the early morning when i can't sleep and really can't find the energy to watch anything else. there is something about watching old b/w movies in the quiet dark of pre-dawn that i find appealing....",1
"since i'd seen the other three, i figured i might as well catch this made for tv fourth part of the omen series. as a stand alone film, this movie is mediocre; but as a sequel to the 1976 masterpiece; it's a travesty. the film goes along the same route that many series' go down when they're running out of ideas; that being the idea of changing the male lead to a female. it's always obvious that this film was made for television as the acting is very standard, the plot lacks ideas and the gruesome murder scenes seen in the previous three are kept to a bloodless minimum. the film does keep a thread with the original, which i won't reveal as despite being obvious; that revelation is one of the most interesting aspects of the movie. the basics of the plot largely copy richard donner's original, and see a young couple adopt a child, which they name delia (not damiella or damiana, fortunately). there's a big dog involved, and a child minder; and pretty soon, the wife starts to suspect that the child may not quite be normal; as she's menstruating at eight years old, and never suffered from any illnesses...  the first two sequels to the omen weren't bad at all, and the series really should have ended at number three. i guess there was money involved somewhere down the line, as there really is no artistic reason why this film should have been made. it brings nothing to the table in terms of originality, and the only thing it's likely to succeed in doing is annoying fans of the series. the film looks and feels like a tv movie all the way through and for the most part plays out like a film about the troubled upbringing of a young girl. indeed, asia vieira does look like a little bitch; but she never convinces that she's the antichrist, as her stares are redundant and most of the 'evil' she does is laughable. faye grant is given the meatiest role, and doesn't impress; while the rest of the cast regret agreeing to star in such an awful waste of time. the only good thing about this movie is the theme tune, which of course has been ripped off from the original; and is overused. on the whole, this film really isn't worth seeing; as it delivers nothing that the series is famous for, and doesn't even do justice to weaker second sequel.",0
"a beautiful shopgirl in london is swept off her feet by a millionaire tea plantation owner and soon finds herself married and living with him at his villa in british ceylon. although based upon the book by robert standish, this initial set-up is highly reminiscent of hitchock's ""rebecca"", with leading lady elizabeth taylor clashing with the imposing chief of staff at the mansion and (almost immediately) her own husband, who is still under the thumb of his deceased-but-dominant father. taylor, a last-minute substitute for an ailing vivien leigh, looks creamy-smooth in her high fashion wardrobe, and her performance is quite strong; however, once husband peter finch starts drinking heavily and barking orders at her, one might think her dedication to him rather masochistic (this feeling hampers the ending as well). still, the film offers a heady lot for soap buffs: romantic drama, a bit of travelogue, interpretive dance, an elephant stampede, and a perfectly-timed outbreak of cholera! *** from ****",1
"this movie is an idiotic attempt at some kind of action thriller. a tour bus on its way to las vegas is attacked by a group of white trash hijackers driving dune buggies. they drive them out into the desert and then steal all of their valuables. the plot changes constantly. one minute they are looking to kidnap a rich ranchers daughter, the next they are looking for a collectible stamp worth 90,000 dollars. the dialogue is horrible.  please don't watch this movie.",0
"the autobiography on which this movie is based remains one of the most heart-rending books i have ever read. it tells the amazing stories of two sisters, both who earned devotion and respect working well into their 70's as a teacher and a dentist, then lived another 30 years with dignity. ruby dee steals the film with her perfectly nuanced performance as the rebellious ""blacker"" bessie, the dentist. she not only expresses her anger, angst, and wisdom well; she lets you know exactly where they've come from using an economy of words. diahnn carroll has the feel of the older sister, the teacher, down perfectly, but i'm afraid she never makes me believe that she's over 100. no matter -- the stories are well worth telling. amy madigan is a bit too extreme and intrusive in acting overwhelmed and insecure in the first half of the movie as the caucasian ny times reporter. this, too, is only a minor distraction. the stories, all true, are the attraction and although two or three get slightly damaged in the translation, most of them make it through just fine.  i recommend the book as essential reading to all people i recommend any books to. i cannot quite but this tv-movie in that rarefied air, but it certainly captures enough of the flavor to be highly worthwhile in its own right.",1

"this is without doubt rajnikanth's worst movies ever. the first part is held in place with solid comedy from goundamani but it progressively gets worse and worse and completely illogical. our hero also takes a dig at saints with the same name (baba) through a corny and utterly lame one-liner. the first half has rajni uttering his usual array of oneliners and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi saint after a beggar takes him through a interdimensional portal to the himalayas where babaji (not the famous saints he took a dig at earlier) gives him special powers for no apparent reason (other than karma). this is really starting to get interesting now isn't it?   the rest of the movie is about him wasting his magic boons and powers and fighting off politicians and related black magic. the usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. oh and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a param vir...er....shakti chakra with him. the bad guys and the usual politician villains are clichéd, overworked and in the end, completely insignificant to the plot which itself doesn't go anywhere.  but despite all the flaws, it was fun to kill time with and yell baba related one-liners during public events. its also fun to watch others curse about this movie. ar rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his movie through the cell phone. thats how important he considered it.  rajni is very popular in japan and he has included two characters (one of them is called keiko...why not samsung?) of japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. but the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. the japanese may stop watching rajni movies after seeing that. this movie was probably promotional material for rajni entering politics but the results of the movie itself would have killed off any of his political dreams.  fun if you turn your brain off though.",0
"i love watching early colour films - you mean those 40s clothes weren't all grey?   margaret rutherford dominates this movie. her ""eccentric"" garb is actually rather attractive and yes, she has an amazing hourglass figure. but i feel she was given her head rather too much. she probably developed this characterisation over many performances, and nobody told her ""if it gets a laugh, leave it out."" she does too much deranged fooling about when she's supposed to be surprisingly down to earth. the madame arcati joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery. arcati behaves like a retired headmistress (we'll really put our backs into it!). the contrast between her breezy, commonplace manner and her wacky beliefs isn't really brought out.  just because all the actors are english (apart from cummings), the americans feel they have to use the words ""brit"", ""stiff"", ""lip"" and ""upper"". oh, give it a rest! the three main characters lose their tempers constantly and make risqué remarks (did he make love to you? yes, but very discreetly - he was in the cavalry!).",0
"i watched this movie alongwith my complete family of nine. since my younger brother has recently got married, we could connect with the goings-on. the movie stands out for the classical touch given to the romance of the engaged couple. thankfully this time all indian locales like ranikhet almora etc have been used, which have been already visited by most of the urbanites, hence adding to the connection with movie. the dialogues are much better than those in the ""umrao jaan ada"" - a supposedly dialogue based movie. the background music is augmenting the ""soft focus"" of the movie. it somehow remind me of vv chopra's ""kareeb"", in which neha and to some extent bobby did full justice to the character. same here, in that the lead pair does not disappoint in any department-looks or acting. the supporting cast are too good. i rate the actress playing the role of bhabhi in the front league. the situations of family interactions portrayed are real and you smile when you find yourself in place of one of the characters. songs were too suiting the scenes and going along well with the movie. however, though i respect ravindra jain for his body of work from movies to ramayana, i missed ram laxman badly.  it had no double entendres(sivan category), no bikinis, no intrigue, and no nonsense. you would comfortably watch the movie with your parents except if you're already or going to be soon engaged. i want to express on candid thing here that though suraj proposes that the marriages is between families and not only individuals, his approach is totally individualistic. the movie is only about prem & poonam, rest of the characters are incidental. art immitating life? the ""peripheral characters"" are consigned to the background and the only protagonists are the lead pair.   coming back, everything was almost great. except, for the drama part. the situation of tragedy was artificially created. the outcome, the sacrifice and the ensuing heart change are not compelling at all. that is why it lacks the emotional punch-the very purpose of this turn of events. but, a twist in the tale was necessary to transcend the movie from a beautiful pre-marital video to a 'feature film'. but i kept waiting for the punch and it never came. the preaching by mohnish bahal and later by alok nath on dowry was out of place and it made things too overboard. may be this will help the movie a tax-free status. but the plot could have been made more interesting and non-linear than what it was.  there were too question in my mind when the movie ended: 1 has the movie really ended? 2 has the movie ended?",1
"this has got to be one of my very favorite twilight zone episodes, primarily for the portrayal of two lonely souls in a post-apocalyptic environment.  the cobweb-strewn shops and rubble-laden streets are eerie in that particular way the twilight zone does best.  while the parable can be a bit heavy-handed by today's drama standards, it is an excellent one - using the setting to make a statement relevant to the human experience, as well as geopolitics, in a way that is timeless. the entire drama rests solely on the shoulders of mr. bronson and ms. montgomery, who do not disappoint. (may they both rest in peace.)  a true classic.",1
"somewhere, buried very deep inside this film is a half-way decent movie trying to get out. the only traces are a few early scenes in los angeles (in a bar and a graveyard) and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design. like i say, buried very deep. one of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations. annie mcenroe's reaction to being told that her sister (presumably dee wallace from the first movie) is (was?) a werewolf is, if i recall, along the lines of; ""oh! really?"". not one of the better responses to said challenge. the non sequitirs continue as the story moves to trannsylvania in search of stirba the (apparently self-appointed) ""queen of the werewolves"". as stirba, sybil danning is the two best things in the movie. yes, even better than the werewolf group-sex scene, reb brown's acting, and the oddly simian-looking werewolf suits. the end credits have assumed minor legend status and are available in all their glory (at least until the censor finds them) on youtube. check them out to see why and remember, the whole film makes about the same amount of sense. if you happen to catch this on us television the credits have been re-edited to replace the endlessly repeated shot of danning ripping off her top with another endlessly repeated shot of her ripping open a cloak only this time she has some kind of top on underneath. it's a sort of absurdity, cherry-on-top moment which defies satire.",0
"i thought that this movies was a letdown i expected it to be so much better than it was. i am so glad i didn't pay to see this movie and that i didn't sit in a movie theater for this one. where to begin on this movie, the acting in this movie was average, the humor was terrible and just the overall storyline of this movie wasn't special. i thought that this movie was suppose to be great, but it wasn't more than a cheesy waste of time. i think that the acting in this movie was terrible no of the actors in this movie had chemistry, it just wasn't there. i think that if maybe we had a different actor play kirk than jay baruchel it might have been better but the entire time i watched this movie he looked high and i didn't get the feeling that he wasn't acting in this movie. now, alice eve did a great job as an actress but, there was no chemistry between her and jay. all the actors in this movie were no names and had very little affect in this movie. the humor in this movie was not funny at all, there were a few one liners in this movie that were ok but nothing worth saying to your friends that they would understand. i think that jim field smith had a hard time with this because he couldn't decide if he wanted a romance or a comedy. i honestly think he needs to stick with the burger king commercials. i think that this movie could have been better if the writers would have gone to a different director. the storyline of this movie is just like every other hot girl just ok guy love storyboring i think that it would have been better if it had more originality, but what a letdown nothing. i honesty would not recommend anyone go see this movie. i think that you would have more entertainment at the dentist than at this movie. so save yourself the agony and just don't see it.",0
"i'm not tired to say this is one of the best political thrillers ever made. the story takes place in a fictional state, but obviously it deals with the murder of kennedy. a truthful and honest district attorney (played by yves montand) does not believe that the murder was planned and executed by the single man daslow (=oswald) and though all other officials want to close the case he continuous to investigate with his team.  the screenplay is written tight and fast and holds the tension till the end. just the part dealing with the milgram experiment about authorities is (though not uninteresting) a bit out of place. the ending sequence - explaining who icarus really is - partly shot in slow motion and intensified by a morricone soundtrack is the most powerful sequence i have ever seen in a movie.",1
this is sad this movie is the tops this should at least be in the top 250 movies here. this is still the best action movie ever done. the action movies of today are badly done the actors and action directors do not no how to do it fighting and stunts properly. only some no how to do it mostly from hong kong like jackie chan. the stunts are so clever and wild i do not think we will see the likes of ever. the start where chan and his team go down the hill car chase through the hill town is just amazing. the end fight stunts are for me the best fight stunts ever put to film. the end stunt sliding down the pole crashing through the glass jackie was badly hurt.,1
"as we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. i've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.  coming into the 40 year old virgin i knew basically what to expect; i did see the commercials after all; ""is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?"" what i didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. there's still the weird ""off-the-wall"" characters that we see so much in adam sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink noah's ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.  the main character andy is (unfortunately for me) a person i can relate to. in the first shot i see that he even shares my love for mystery science theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. most importantly of all; andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. it's like my life story.  the other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way andy does. i felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since andy and his girlfriend trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.  i suppose since i mentioned one flaw i might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. the story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. it deals with andy's relationship with trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and i assure you it does. these are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that i can easily ignore it's few faults.  when i say ""good"" i mean ""bad"" of course. this is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. for the most part i think it succeeded. there are so many hilarious scenes such as andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with trish. or the scene where andy goes with his trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ""ooh! como se llama!"" an interesting little note about that scene; the actor steve carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.  actually since we're talking about steve carell, i'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since i didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. i was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that i now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. this man has talent it the 40 year old virgin proves that.  to be honest i had doubts about this film but early word was positive and i knew it was something i was eventually going to see. i'm glad that i did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies i've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. it's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance. now excuse me while i go puke my guts out; i can't believe i just wrote that...  my review from frider waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin",1
"this movie was exactly what i expected, not great, but also not that bad either. in my opinion pg13 movies aren't scary enough so that's why i already knew i was going to be bored throughout the entire film. sure there were scary things going on in the hotel room, but nothing we all haven't already seen. i guess i didn't like it because i thought there were too many twists and turns happening; it got old and repetitive. i also didn't understand if all the things cusack was experiencing in the room was real or not. there is no explanation for any of the events that occurred. the movie just drags on and when it finally does come to an end you want it to keep going because you are still waiting around for someone to tell you what the whole movie was about. what i did like was the special effects. other than that there wasn't much enjoyment from it. maybe its just me but i thought this was below average.",0
"i found this to be the most enjoyable muppets movie, because i felt it was the most light-hearted and had the best comic delivery on most of its lines. the muppets try to go on broadway to sell an original musical they've written, but along the way, they run into the usual problems, including kermit's memory loss here. while there aren't as many great cameos here as in the original ""muppets movie,"" there are some including joan rivers and dabney coleman. simply the timing and delivery of so many of the lines is great, and the situations the muppets find themselves in are hilarious. the original songs are also good here, and the ending is satisfying. there is not much else to say about the film, but muppet fans should see it for sure. it is the funniest muppet movie and is sure to be enjoyed by all.  ***1/2 out of ****",1
"""red rock west"" was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90's with a superb script (by john and rick dahl) that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film. it was brilliantly directed by john dahl and featured a marvellous cast including nicolas cage, dennis hopper, lara flynn boyle and especially j. t. walsh (in a memorable performance) making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed. the film never had much publicity on release (in fact i first caught up with it on tv) and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film is now slowly gaining a cult following.  nicolas cage is michael williams who is broke and out of work when he finds himself in the small town of red rock. mistaken for a contract killer named lyle from dallas he is shocked to be offered $10,000 to murder the wife of bar owner wayne brown (the excellent j. t. walsh). he plays along with the plan and decides he should go and warn brown's wife suzanne (lara flynn boyle) but then the plot thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and double dealings - that cage is thrown from one crisis to another and finds himself trapped in a terrible situation he can't drag himself out of! then just to complicate matters even further the real lyle turns up to carry out the contract killing (played by everyone's favourite heavy dennis hopper). when hopper discovers what has happened he goes after cage but no one could forsee the surprising events that follow.  some favourite lines from the film:  nicolas cage (to lara flynn boyle): ""i hate to see an innocent woman get hurt but it's an awful lot of money"".  j. t. walsh (to cage): ""michael williams. well, michael, you're going to be spending some time with us till we get to the bottom of this"".  boyle (to cage): ""you're not a killer?"". cage: ""that's right, no. but the guy i'm supposed to be just rode into town so you gotta get out of here"".  boyle (to cage): ""o.k. how you're going to explain impersonating a hired killer and taking $10,000 from my husband?"".  an extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (just 98 minutes) with a storyline that never lets up and powerful acting by all the principals. any film featuring j. t. walsh is o.k. in my book and ""red rock west"" was one of his best. how sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was cut tragically short by a heart attack in 1998. the most prolific period for ""film noir"" was without any doubt the forties but ""red rock west"" is a good modern example of the genre and has jumped right into my ""top ten"" list of all time favourite films. i look forward to more like this from director john dahl. 10/10. clive roberts.

"when this film was released in 1997 the 'special effects', such as they are, were poor. they would have been dated even for the 1980s, and even some films made in the 1970s and 1960s have had the same or better sfx work. certainly no-one involved in the production of this film was looking for an oscar. it's a wild departure from director fred olen ray's usual stuff, most of which has the word ""bikini"" in the title (bikini pirates, bikini chain gang, bikini girls from the lost planet, etc) and are little more than t&a flicks, but here we are with a film rated ""u"" and aimed squarely at the kiddies. you've got to give him credit for diversifying!! this was a minor direct-to-video cult hit which later resulted in a couple of sequels - invisible mom 2 and invisible dad. dee wallace-stone (whose career went downhill fast after 1982s ""e.t.) plays the 'invisible mom' of the films title and would return for the sequel. russ tamblyn (whose career had been in free-fall even longer since 1961s ""west side story"") plays the villainous dr. woorter. it's probably fair to say that most of the cast were at the point in their careers where they would be prepared to work on almost anything just to pay the bills that month - except maybe young trenton knight as josh. it's rather telling though that although he worked prior to this movie, this child actor didn't work again after the sequel, ""invisible mom 2"". maybe the film was cursed. after all, he wasn't that bad in this film. for a child actor, he's pretty good - no better or worse than any of his more experienced co-stars.  as mentioned above, the ""invisibility"" effects are naff to say the least, the direction is poor, the writing obvious and the acting nothing to write home about. there are plenty of worse films out there though, and for anyone under the age of about ten, this film will no doubt be quite watchable. most adults will probably want to do a disappearing act of their own while it is on though, and i wouldn't blame them one bit!",0
"lupin sets off for morocco, looking for a legendary treasure. his only clue is an interesting jewel that an old man gave him. it's a nice different location for lupin, with the desert and that hot exotic feel.  one interesting thing about this movie is that jigen has a much smaller role than usual, generally being in a different place than lupin. on one hand their classic dynamic together is missed, but it is a change of pace. plus, this way, lupin can focus on the ladies...  fujiko rules in this. throughout the entire feature she is seducing lupin, and us viewers. then there's lara, the damsel of this particular tale, and she's quite likable. this one has more nudity than any other lupin anime, which is a fun distinction to have.  there's a very entertaining effeminate ninja guy who's the best villain in this, and naturally he has some great fighting with goemon, as well as some fun scenes with fujiko. inspector zenigata of course is also on a warpath here, in fine form.  pretty much, this is a smooth ride with lupin. the plot is average and there are some slow spots, but all in all this movie is a real pleasure. enjoy.",1
"first i want to clarify that the average user's inability to appreciate imagination is appalling. what makes this show so unique is the hyper-reality it creates. you don't need to know why ned can bring people back from the dead, or why it can only be for a minute. where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone, much like a wrinkle in time.  i say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of lay-it-all-out television that leaves no room for imagination or wonder.  it's nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experience.  the hyper-reality is my favorite aspect of the show. the 1950's-esque setting, the innocent and rare characters, and the scenery and physical setting which are not meant to be taken as pure reality.  this show masks the morbid nature of death, while others embrace it. while entertaining, other television shows have taken a back shelf to this series. it truly has restored a sense of curiosity, imagination and wonder to television.  pushing daisies quickly made it to the top of my list.",1
"wow. a truly fantastic 'trip' movie that has tons of super-surreal imagery, dark intent and a black, pretty strange sense of how cartoon animals must see the world. it's populated with a very cute off-world bunch of characters that bend and flow with warped backgrounds.as with all cool fantasy, the wandering plot is secondary to the eye-popping visuals and we follow a little cat and his zombie sister as they encounter death, deluge, water elephants, samurai swordsmen and pigs that fish. i'd never heard of it, but now i love it - probably because it reminded me of the surreal pencil-work of american cartoonist; bill plympton. it's a demented delight for fans of odd, pretty things and it had me glued to the screen for fear i'd miss something amazing. simply put, it's 'hello kitty' without the 'o'.",1
"as always this is an inaccurate picture of the homeless. tv told a lot of lies about panhandlers in the early 1990s and made everyone look bad, and claimed we all made over $100 a day when $20-40 a day was much closer to reality. when someone drove by where i held up a sign offering to work, and offered me work, i actually went and took the work if i was physically able.and if i would been offered the $100,000 id damned sure invested in in apt prepaid for at least 2 years, and kept most in the bank and still left myself $10-20000 for nl $1-2 and $2-5 cash games at the casinos. i usually always win and could win decent if i just had a bankroll. instead i win about $1000 a month is all playing in always minimum buying in due to not wanting to risk losing it all. i was only homeless cause i didn't wanna risk spending all my money and going broke, sometimes i had over $1000-2000 in my sock while i slept outside. anyone wanting to talk contact sevencard2003 on yahoo messenger.i admit i was different than most homeless people though, due to the fact i never drank smoke or took drugs. im no longer homeless, am now in govt housing for $177 a month and getting ssi and spend most of my time winning at online poker. mom and sunflower diversified worked hard to get me ssi. glad my days of hiding in under the stage in the convention center of the casino at night sleeping, worrying about getting caught by security are finally over. had this tv crew picked me theyd been over a lot sooner. its a shame how they don't better select who they pick.",0
"standard procedure for swedish movies today seem to be to start by throwing plausibility out the window and continue down that path for the rest of the process. rånarna is another fine example of a movie making very little sense.  banks in stockholm are being robbed by a highly efficient ""military-styled"" gang of robbers. two police officers start investigating the case that soon becomes more complicated than it would appear at first.  as usual in swedish film the cast is mostly made up of the same people you have seen over and over again. mikael persbrandt must be in every swedish film from the last few years! but that's ok i guess since persbrandt is one of few that performs solidly here (like he usually does). the problems with this film mostly revolves around the story itself. first of all the robberies feel mostly like background. rather this is more a movie about a young policewoman fighting to prove herself in a male world (like that has not been made a thousand times before with a decent actress instead of sofia helin). also there is a completely unbelievable plot twist near the end that seems about as plausible as aliens landing. but still, i did think it was a quite nice touch considering i was half asleep right about then. it spiced things up a bit (and actually saved the rating from dropping another step).  in the end the main problem is the same thing as with most other swedish movies of this kind. simply that the action and suspense doesn't live up to the standards we are used to from other movies of this kind (mostly hollywood). it feels cheap and rather weak in comparison. in my opinion swedish filmmakers should try to focus more on plot and acting, and forget about trying to make ""hollywood-action light"" like they do now. because this becomes yet another forgettable effort from the swedish movie-industry. i rate it 3/10.",0

"i was very disappointed by this movie. i thought that ""scary movie"" although not a great movie was very good and funny. ""scary movie 2"" on the other hand was boring, not funny, and at times plain stupid.  the exorcist/amityville spoof was probably the best part of the movie. james woods was great.  now, i'll admit that i am at a disadvantage since i have not seen a few of the movies that this parodies unlike the first, where i had basically seen them all. but bad comedy is still bad comedy.  something that really hurt this movie was the timing, which ruined some of what might have been good jokes. scenes and jokes drag out way to long.  also, the same jokes keep getting repeated again and again. for example, the talking bird. ok it was funny the first and maybe even the second time. but it kept getting repeated to the point of annoying. the routine between the wheelchair guy and hanson (chris elliott) was amusing at first but it kept getting repeated and ended up stupid and even tasteless.  some jokes even got repeated from the first movie. for example, the 'creaming' i guess you would call it of cindy (anna faris) was funny in ""scary movie"" because cindy had been holding out on giving her boyfriend sex for so long, that essentially he had blue balls from hell and it was funny when he 'creamed' her. but this time around it was out of place and not funny.  the bathroom and sexual humor in general was more amusing and well timed the first time around. the scat humor was excessive though and rather unneccessary in the second film.  tori spelling was annoying and really had no place in this movie.  but i did enjoy shorty (marlon wayans) who in my opinion was the funniest character in the first film. the scene with him and the pot plant was one of my favorites from the second film.  don't get me wrong, i love the wayans family and their humor. that is why this film is so disappointing . . . they have a lot more comic ability than endless scat jokes.",0

"""against all flags"" is every bit the classic swashbuckler. it has all the elements the adventure fan could hope for and more for in this one, the damsel in distress is, well, not really in distress. as spitfire stevens, maureen o'hara is at her athletic best, running her foes through in defiance of the social norms of the period. anthony quinn rounds out the top three billed actors as the ruthless captain roc brasiliano and proves to be a wily and capable nemesis for brian hawke (flynn). for the classic adventure fan, ""against all flags"" is a must-see. while it may not be in quite the same league as some of errol flynn's earlier work (captain blood and the sea hawk, for instance), it is still a greatly entertaining romp.",1
"i have seen all the films directed by robert redford and appreciated his love of the american people and the land. in a river runs through it, redford displays the lyric romanticism and visual splendor of the high rocky mountains of montana as if he were a 19th century landscape painter of the ilk of thomas moran or albert bierstadt. this film makes love to the visual and the word with text by author norman maclean, and stunning camera work by phillippe rousselot (serpent's kiss, reigne margot).  redford's cast is perfect. tom skerritt is the rev. maclean, a man whose methods of education include fly fishing as well as the bible, brenda blythen, the mother, and his sons, craig schaffer and brad pitt create a family whose interactions reflect the same problems all encounter with growing teenage sons, and later, complex young men. both schaffer and pitt are totally believable as the brothers whose love of fly fishing and each other will tie them together forever. it is the relationships between men, father and sons, brothers, and their women to the outside world that grounds a river runs through it to a vein of storytelling that is missing in so many of hollywood films produced in recent years.  what makes these relationships special however, is the attention redford gives to the language as spoken in dialogue. this is a literate script, beautiful to hear and unforgettable when coupled with the stunning montana rivers and mountains. the words and setting are equal to performances by a cast that rises to their material. while the idea of fly fishing may seem an odd device to center a story, it is not so implausible in redford's directorial hands. given the material, redford's ode to a simpler time and life is worth revisiting again and again.",1
"in 1983, director brian de palma set out to make a film about the rise and fall of an american gangster, and that he did-- with the help of a terrific screenplay by oliver stone and some impeccable work by an outstanding cast. the result was `scarface,' starring al pacino in one of his most memorable roles. the story begins in may of 1980, when castro opened the harbor at mariel, cuba, to allow cuban nationals to join their families in the united states. 125,000 left cuba at that time, for the greener pastures of freedom in america, and most were honest, hard-working people, thankful for the opportunity they had been granted. but not all. among the `marielitos' who streamed into florida, approximately 25,000 had criminal records and were nothing less than the dregs of cuba's jails-- criminals considered beyond redemption, who castro had merely wanted to be rid of. and they, too, saw america as a land of opportunity, even as al capone had considered chicago some fifty years earlier. and among the most ambitious was a man named tony montana (pacino), known to his associates as `caracortada.' scarface.  now that he was free of the yoke of communism under which he had grown up, montana wanted what he felt was coming to him, and he wanted it now; and from the moment he stepped off the boat in florida, he was determined to have it all. wealth and power-- that was montana's dream, and he would get it by doing what he did best, beginning with a favor for a man living in miami by the name of frank lopez (robert loggia). lopez, it seems, had a brother in cuba who had met an untimely end at the hands of one of castro's goons, a man who, having outlived his usefulness to castro, had been summarily discarded and was currently being held in `little havana,' along with montana and all of the cubans just off the boats, where they awaited their papers from the government that would effect their transition into their new lives. and in short order, montana sees to it that lopez's brother has been avenged, and it sets the stage for his own entrance into the underworld of america.  lopez, a wealthy businessman with the right connections, in return for the favor gets montana and his friend, manny (steven bauer), released from the holding camp, and puts them to work. in his day, capone may have had bootlegging as a means through which to line his coffers with illicit gain, but lopez has the modern day equivalent, and it's even more lucrative: cocaine. lopez takes montana under his wing and indoctrinates him into the life, but once he has a taste of it, montana isn't satisfied with whatever crumbs lopez sees fit to throw his way, and he sets a course that will take him to where he wants to be: at the `top.' with a cold-blooded, iron will, montana decides he'll do whatever it takes to get there, no matter what the cost. but before it's over, he will realize the price for his dream, and he'll pay it; but for a brief moment, perhaps he will know what it's like to be the man. and he will also know whether or not it was worth it.  in step with de palma's vision, pacino plays montana larger-than-life, and he does it beautifully. from the accent he affects (which he researched thoroughly to make sure he got it right-- and he did), to the body language and the attitude, he's got it all, and it makes montana convincing and very real. what he brings to the role is nuance and style, in a way that few actors (de niro would be one) can. this is definitely not a character that is sympathetic in any way, nor is there anything about montana that you can readily relate to on a personal level; but pacino's screen presence is so strong that it makes him a thoroughly engrossing character, even though it's hard to become emotionally involved with him. it's quite simply a dynamic, memorable performance.  michelle pfeiffer gives a solid performance, as well, in the role that put her on the path to stardom. as elvira, the woman who becomes an integral part of montana's dream, pfeiffer is subtle and understated, giving that sense of something going on underneath, while affecting a rather cold and distant exterior countenance. she, like pacino, definitely makes her presence felt as she fairly glides across the screen with a stoic, enigmatic and sultry demeanor.  the supporting cast includes mary elizabeth mastrantonio (gina), miriam colon (mama montana), f. murray abraham (omar), paul shenar (sosa) and harris yulin (bernstein). an excellent precursor to the more recent and highly acclaimed `traffic,' and `blow,' and well as having a climactic scene reminiscent of peckinpah's `the wild bunch,' de palma's `scarface,' originally panned by critics, has since been cited by many as being the definitive american gangster saga. much of the violence is implied rather than graphic, but this film still has an edge of realism to it that many may find somewhat disturbing. but if you stay with it, there is a lesson to be learned in the end. and like many lessons in life, the most valuable are often the hardest to take at the time. but the reward is always worth it, and that's the way it is with this film. i rate this one 8/10.

"murder and insurance fraud take an adulterous couple to ""the end of the line""...  tv was visually vulgar back in the early 1970s and this truncated, made-for-tv knock-off hurt my eyes. it can't possibly compare to the 1944 billy wilder film noir classic as anyone in their right mind ought to know -sight unseen- but that doesn't mean this update should be seen as a separate entity, either. although based on the original paramount screenplay, there's over half an hour cut out and the director's bland indifference makes what's left imminently forgettable. with rare exception, the younger generation wasn't interested in watching old black and white movies on tv back in 1973 (still true today, alas) so this lurid, compelling tale was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers; then as now, ratings rule and cashing in was its only reel raison d'etre. gus van zandt remade alfred hitchcock's psycho for similar reasons and if these redux led to the seeking out of the original films or novels, so much the better. i loved the james m. cain source novel enough to tune in back then and i enjoyed this time capsule curio the second time around for the longish hair, halter tops, turbans, ugly decor, and lush auburn locks of ""guest star"" samantha eggar, who didn't try too hard. in addition to recognizing a few of the incidental cast from a childhood spent in front of the boob tube, lee j. cobb was able to hold my interest as a world-weary, tired-looking keyes but richard crenna's affable and inoffensive walter neff only reminded me of bill bixby on a bad day. improvement upon the original was, of course, never intended in a rush to make a buck but, instead of a mindless retread, a new adaptation of the novel would have been a novel idea. cain's book differs somewhat from its celluloid incarnations and the horrific shark fins in the moonlight ending is killer. the completist in me is thankful this speeded up ""me decade"" update was included as part of the double indemnity dvd extras but the experience not only made me long to see the original, it had me nostalgic for any episode of the better-made columbo tv series. i also flashed back to a very good 1973 abc tv movie of the week that i haven't seen since its initial airing: john d. macdonald's linda starring the beautiful stella stevens as a ruthless femme fatale who murders her lover's (sexy john saxon) wife and then frames her mild-mannered husband for the crime and, if i remember correctly, there's also an open-ended ending. like double indemnity, it was needlessly remade with tv movie queen virginia madsen as the titular vixen and richard thomas as the milquetoast husband.",0
"spoiler!! i love branagh, love helena bonham-carter, loved them together in ""mary shelley's frankenstein"" - but this -  i can understand an actor's desire to stretch, to avoid the romantic stereotype. well, they did, but really - the script droned on, bonham-carter's clothes were tres chic, and the occasional speeded-up ""madcap"" sequence could have been an outtake from a beatles' movie, or the old rowan and martin laugh-in.  i never got the point - other commenters say the branagh character was a dreamer. i never felt that. he was a loser, and not very bright, and certainly not endearing. the business with the bank robber disguise was merely painful to watch. certainly not amusing.  bonham-carter's realistic (one supposes) attempts as realistic speech were harder to understand than the first 15 minutes of lancashire accent in ""full monty.""  the poetic ending, with him high on a hill with her buried under the monstrosity of his airplane was too orchestrated. was there a choir of angels, or merely a soundtrack?  go back to the classics or something with a spine and an arc to it. donate this to pbs.

"i'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity, as despite some rather silly goings on; the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money. michael winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time, and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film; but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction, and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it. the plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat. she finds that she can't afford most properties she looks at, but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price. her problems start soon after moving in, as she doesn't like her neighbours very much...and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour; an elderly blind priest on the top floor...  the cast list is truly superb, with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast. chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines, but small parts for the likes of john carradine, eli wallach, ava gardner, jeff goldblum and christopher walken, to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon's lifeless portrayal. michael winner does a good job with his central location, as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story. the film is a little slow to start, but it's never boring; and michael winner's screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the offset, which certainly deserves some praise. like many similar slow-burning horrors, this one doesn't go for the money shot early on - but unlike many, the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer, and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true; i've got to say that he does a very good job at it! overall, while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it; the sentinel is one of the better films of its type, and it's definitely a major highlight for its director.",1
"this film was rather a disappointment. after the very slow, very intense (and quite gory) beginning the film begins to lose it. too much plot leaves too little time for explanation, and coming out of the theater i wondered what this was all about. the characters remain shallow, the story is not convincing at all, most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody, and there are some very cheesy parts... like, the young cop has to do dig up a body. of course it's night and it rains and he has to do it alone... yawn! or the manifestation of the evil being ""nazis"" plus ""genetic manipulation""... wow, that's really original. there are some nice bits, though, like the fistfight scene, mountain views and some (running) gags, but (though reno and vincent cassel do what they can) that's definitely not worth it.

"i hate to be the one to rain on a parade (even a small one like this) but from the very first scene, you could tell this film was going to be absolute shite. its a shame really, as i quite like martin freeman and danny dyer. i was intrigued as to how they would mix in a film together, but to my dismay, they did not even have a scene together!! i think i need to repeat this - the two lead actors (who stand side by side on the advertisement posters and dvd covers) did not have one scene together!!!! they did not speak to each other and never appeared on screen at the same time. just about sums up this poor excuse for a movie. false advertisement.  the dialogue was painful, every single character in the movie was unrealistic, and un-human like. the scenarios were far fetched, the plot was crap, the jokes were thin, freeman tried too hard to be funny (and played a poor mans tim from the office), nobody was likable, and worst of all, some of the characters were so annoying that it almost drove me to switch off, as i couldn't bear to watch, or listen to them any longer.  this low budget stinker was an epic fail. even danny dyer couldn't inject some humour and charm into this, but bless, he tried. what a waste of time.  how anybody could rate this movie as 'ten stars' is beyond me. ten stars? seriously? come on....i won't even give some of the greats ten stars, as ten stars implies that a movie was perfect. this film was far from perfect, almost the opposite, meaning that it was almost completely dire throughout.  watch it if you like, but if you've seen a lot of movies, and watched a lot of great movies, your review will probably similar to mine.  1/10",0

i for one was glad to see jim carrey in a film where being over the top wasn't the goal. his character is like all of us. wanting more - better things to happen to us and expecting god to deliver.  morgan freeman made a great god. with a sense of humor and a genuine sense of love for each of us yet ready to take a little vacation when the opportunity presents itself.  i thought jennifer aniston's character was a little too vulnerable and understanding towards carry's basically self-centered tv anchorman wanna-be but that's the way it was written.  i think the previews ruined several potentially very funny scenes because everyone who saw them knew what was coming before it happened.  i have read a number of the reviews and it seems some people are looking a little too deep. this is a summer comedy and is not meant to solve the problems of the world although there are a few messages we could all take to heart.  a funny film.,1

"now i'll be the first to admit it when i say something that may be blasphemous or unfair, so i would like to apologize in advance for my ranting about how much i disliked this movie.  that about sums it up too. i disliked this movie. to be more specific, i disliked the concept of this movie. the cinematography was good. the mood was nice. and the acting was satisfactory.   however, the story is fatuous, unacurate and misleading. it is also offensive.  i am a quarter cree indian, and for some reason i feel insulted, on a personal level, by the nature of whitaker's character. first of all, he's a black guy. and this isn't a racist remark, i swear. the thought of a white, hispanic or even native american swinging a katana on a rooftop offends everything that the katana represents. the katana represents the soul of a samurai, imbibed with the souls of his ancestors who guide and protect the samurai. for ghost dog to use his guns instead of the katana is also an insult to the blade and the souls inside, and where the heck did he get a katana anyway? it must be one of those replicas, which insults the samurai caste even more.  also, ghost dog showed no honor. near the end of the movie, he shoots a bodyguard in the back through a window and then assassinates a man by shooting him in the face through a faucet drain. not only is this a cowards way to kill an enemy, it's more like a ninjas way; silent assassins; a group that samurais deny exists, but hates none-the-less.  then he tries to kill his boss, when he finds out his boss is a baddie. you know what a true samurai does when he learns his master is proven bad or dishonorable? he kills himself, to prove that he would rather die then lower himself to the level of his doggish master.  everything about the character was a giant contradiction to the real code that all samurai adhere to: bushido.  so, we have great cinematography, good ambiance and so-so acting encompassing a satiricle plot and premise, (which unfortunately is the most important aspect of it) , making it an unsatisfactory overall film, and an insult to everything a honorable bushi(samurai) holds dear.   2.5/10 bleah",0

"although i agree that it's a good but not great movie, for many of the reasons other posters have mentioned, i still enjoy it. one reason is the music: i'd call attention to the very cool appearance by the candoli brothers -- conte and pete -- in a well-staged scene in the nightclub. these guys were two of the best jazz trumpeters of their day, and they manage to convincingly boggle the mind of jimmy stewart by playing an hysterical trumpet duet, one trumpet in each of stewart's ears. the candolis really did play that well, too, though i suspect the actual music for that scene was dubbed later by the two of them. i don't know much about george duning, who gets the credit for the music (other than that he seems to have worked with the three stooges on more than one occasion), but the casting of the candoli brothers as jazz-playing warlocks was a real nice touch.",1
"""a family affair"" takes us back to a less complicated time in america. it's sobering to see how different everything was back then. it was a more innocent era in our country and we watch a 'functional' family dealing in things together. the film also marks the beginning of the series featuring the hardy family.  the film, directed by george seitz, is based on a successful play. judge james hardy, and his wife emmily, are facing a domestic crisis that must be dealt with. married daughter joan comes home after she has committed a social blunder and her husband holds her responsible. at the same time, another daughter, marion, brings home a beau, who is clear will clash with her father. the happy teen ager andy, seems to be the only one without a problem until his mother makes him escort polly to the dance, something he is reluctant to do.  needless to say, judge hardy will prove why he knows best as he puts a plan into action to get everyone together again. after all, he is a man that understands, not only the law, but how to deal with those outside forces that threatens his standing in the community and what will make his family happy.  lionel barrymore plays judge hardy with conviction. he is the glue that holds everything together. spring byington is seen as emily, the mother. mickey rooney has a small part in this film, but he is as always, fun to watch. cecilia parker and julie haydon appeared as the daughters, marion and joan. sara hayden and margaret marquis are also featured in the film as aunt milly and polly, the girl that surprises andy with her beauty.

"this film has a lot of raw potential. the script is sharp, the dialogue is (usually) excellent (though it could stand to lose the cheezy voice-overs), the direction and cinematography is surprisingly quite good, though some of the experimentation just doesn't work. the main problem here is david duchovny. once a geek-boy, always a geek-boy; and the sad, simple fact is that he's incapable of playing anything but fox mulder. he postures, he tries to be slick, he poses, he tries to be macho. in the end he just tries too hard. he overplays his character, he overspeaks his lines, and he's just outplayed in all ways by timothy hutton and angelina jolie, who are each in a class above him in terms of acting skill. timothy hutton was (as always) really good. there was a spotty moment or two where he over-dramatized his role, but you could tell he was having fun with it. he looked the part, and he became the character both physically and atmospherically. angelina jolie was also really good. she didn't have much of a role; in fact, i though she could have used a much stronger one...her character wasn't nearly developed enough, though she did remarkably well with what she had. and the chemistry between her and hutton was apparent (gee, maybe that's why uma left him...;) all in all, it was rough around the edges, but a solid effort by a good cast and great supporting roles. if david duchovny hadn't ripped his role to pieces it would've been *that* much better. 7/10.",1
"i wasn't expecting the highest calibre of film-making with joel schumacher directing this one, so i was surprised that tigerland wasn't a complete waste of time.  in technique, it's often derivative of saving private ryan with the shaky camera work, grainy shots, the film occasionally running like it's skipping a sprocket---all those techniques speilberg used to make his film seem more realistic but in the end was more distracting than anything else.  but unlike saving private ryan, the emotional component wasn't as weak, as the characters in this film seemed more like real people and the story less contrived, not so wrapped up in the american flag (speilberg gets an 'f' in subtlety).  next to the first section of kubrick's full metal jacket, this is the most realistic portrayal of boot camp that i have seen in a film, and for that i think it's worth watching.  it's not a great film, but neither is it a bad film.",1

"one star for the ""plot"". one star for the acting. one star for the dubbing into squeaky-voiced american. five stars for monica broeke and inge maria granzow, with their propensity for taking all their clothes off. and ten out of ten for the divine emmanuelle béart, two years before she made 'manon des sources'. béart also undresses a couple of times, but even fully-clothed her presence is enough to make this film eminently watchable. watch out for the scene where she tells her friend about the three ""first times"" for a girl. it's corny, but still far more erotic than the rather laughably choreographed ""love scenes"" featuring broeke, granzow and patrick bauchau. incidentally, the cinematography is not great; the stills for the closing credits are a better indication of what david hamilton is capable of.",0
"i saw the long day's dying when it first came out at the cinema, i thought the film gave a good soldiers point of view, it gave a realistic account, of men at war. the storyline moves at a nice pace, showing a group of men behind enemy lines, and trying to return back to their own lines with an enemy prisoner. the characters are well developed, and believable.  david hemmings is a good actor and plays the leading role with conviction, as does alan dobie (as german helmut) i was surprised, that i have been unable to find this film on vhs or dvd, and i feel it has become the forgotten film, which is sad , as it is superior to many other war films i have seen.",1
"having seen three other versions of the same film, i am afraid for me this is by far the weakest, primarily due to scott's rather dull and leaden performance. his emotions throughout are so bland it makes it difficult to engage in the film. alistair sim portrayed the role infinitely better. when scrooge was at his meanest, you don't get the sense scott is saying the dialogue with much conviction and when he undergoes his metamorphosis he is similarly unconvincing. i cannot think of any actors in this film who match those from the alistair sim version. even the musical version (and frankly the muppets) take on this are better executed. very disappointing.",0

"what a great film it is. the notion of nations sending people fighting each other with giant robots is tacky. the ending is not just a fitting one, it's more inspirational.  but i am intrigued by the characters. it is a pity we never see the relationship of achilles and athena more developed beyond just a couple of kisses and athena's fear for achilles's safety. their romance is very enjoyable.

"rouen prizes and the triumph of ""villa paranoia"" the favorite film of the general public, actually more important than the jury prize, was erik clausen's brilliant bittersweet dramatic comedy, ""villa paranoia"", which was also selected by the european youth jury indicative of its appeal to cinephiles of all ages. the following day director-actor clausen traveled to the remote town of mamers, pays de loire, for a provincial festival of new european cinema, where ""villa paranoia"" picked up three more prizes -- best film, professional jury; best film, audience prize; and best film of another youth jury composed of ""lycéens"", french high school students. five prizes in a single weekend -- not a bad scoop for a film from a small country with unknown actors. in addition, ""villa"" was awarded the grand prix, the maverick spirit award, at san jose, california, just a week ago, by distinguished british actor sir ben kingsley (""ghandi""), making for a grand total of six prizes in a single week. if lars van trier has put denmark on the offbeat-oddball dogma cinematic map in recent years, there is now a good chance that veteran maverick erik clausen (62) and his capable crew of actors will soon show the world that denmark has more to offer than dogmatic drivel, which is to say, a mass audience pleaser for young and old alike. moreover, the female lead of his film, sonja richter, has such a magical screen presence that, with a little more exposure, she stands a good chance of becoming the next international scandinavian diva. for the record, ""villa paranoia"" is a fiction film, written, directed and acted in by mr. clausen, and employing certain motifs from moliere's ""the imaginary invalid"". anna (richter), an ambitious young actress, has lost a deeply coveted role in the moliere play and, reduced to making an utterly stupid tv chicken commercial, is on the verge of suicide. however, jorgen (clausen) who runs a massive chicken farm sponsoring the spot, offers her a job with room and board taking care of his cantankerous, senile, wheel-chair ridden father, walentin, who has not spoken a word since his wife stella committed suicide years before. anna is the only one who eventually finds a way of communicating with the hostile silent old grouch -- and moreover, discovers that he has been faking deafness and immobility all these years -- a living ""malade imaginaire"". this will lead to her playing the greatest role of her own life in order to uncover the dark secret which led to walentin's total withdrawal from life and reality. villa ""paradise-paranoia"", true to the moliere tradition from which it is partially derived, is a heartwarming, multi-layered, serial-comic psycho-drama that literally has something for everybody and only needs proper placement to attain the kind of general international outreach it richly deserves. alex deleon, paris / 21 march, 2005",1
"altered species starts one friday night in los angeles where dr. irwin (guy vieg) & his laboratory assistant walter (allen lee haff) are burning the midnight oil as they continue to try & perfect a revolutionary new drug called 'rejenacyn'. as walter tips the latest failed attempt down the sink the pipes leak the florescent green liquid into the basement where escaped lab rats begin to drink it... five of walter's friends, alicia (leah rown in a very fetching outfit including some cool boots that she gets to stomp on a rat with), gary (richard peterson), burke (derek hofman), frank (david bradley) & chelsea (alexandra townsend) decide that he has been working too hard & needs to get out so they plan to pick him up & party the night away. back at the lab & the cleaner douglas (robert broughton) has been attacked & killed by the now homicidal rats in the basement as walter injects the latest batch of serum in a lab rat which breaks out of it's cage as it grows at an amazing rate. walter's friends turn up but he can't leave while the rat is still missing so everyone helps him look for it. all six become potential rat food...  also known as rodentz altered species was co-edited & directed by miles feldman & has very little to recommend it. the script by producer serge rodnunsky is poor & coupled together with the general shoddiness of the production as a whole altered species really is lame. for a start the character's are dumb, annoying & clichéd. then there's the unoriginal plot with the mad scientist, the monster he has created, the isolated location, the stranded human cast & the obligatory final showdown between hero & monster. it's all here somewhere. altered species moves along at a fair pace which is just about the best thing i can say about it & thankfully doesn't last that long. it's basically your average run-of-the-mill killer mutant rat film & not a particularly good one at that either.  director feldman films like a tv film & the whole thing is throughly bland & forgettable while some of the special effects & attack scenes leave a lot to be desired. for a start the cgi rats are awful, the attack sequences feature hand-held jerky camera movement & really quick edits to try & hide the fact that all the rats are just passively sitting there. at various points in altered species the rat cages need to shake because of the rats movement but you can clearly see all the rats just sitting there as someone shakes the cages off screen. the giant rat monster at the end looks pretty poor as it's just a guy in a dodgy suit. there are no scares, no tension or atmosphere & since when did basements contain bright neon lighting? there are one or two nice bits of gore here, someone has a nice big messy hole where their face used to be, there's a severed arm & decapitation, lots of rat bites, someone having their eyeball yanked out & a dead mutilated cat.  technically altered species is sub standard throughout. it takes place within the confines of one building, has cheap looking cgi effects & low production values. the acting isn't up to much but it isn't too bad & a special mention to leah rowan as alicia as she's a bit of a babe & makes altered species just that little bit nicer & easier to watch...  altered species isn't a particularly good film, in fact it's a pretty bad one but i suppose you could do worse. not great but it might be worth a watch if your not too demanding & have nothing else to do.",0
"julie waters is always marvelous but adrian pasdar is a positive revelation in this wry gender-bent comedy about a transvestite who cannot suppress his obsession, and the changes he goes through when he's discovered. unerringly eschews the vulgar, raucous easy jokes for genuine wit and true insight, and has an absolute ball while doing it. a very nice, low-key, feel-good, comedy",1

"yet another early film from alfred hitchcock which seems to have been done out of contractual obligation. as with juno and the paycock, you can tell that hitchcock had little interest in this movie. there is almost no style or craft to it at all. the story revolves around fred and emily, a young married couple, who come into some money and go on a cruise which proves to be a test of their marriage. emily is given a chance at a new life with a good hearted, wealthy man who falls in love with her, but chooses to take the high road and stay with her husband. this might seem more believable if fred weren't made out to be a completely insensitive, pompous ass who jumps at the first opportunity he sees to leave his wife for another woman. the couple ends up staying together, but the movie lacks any real reconciliation scene. the third act goes in a completely different direction, with the couple stranded on an abandoned ship and rescued by an asian fishing boat. joan barry does give a very stirring performance as the faithful wife of an unfaithful husband. that's about all you can say for this one.",0
"most people, when they think of expressionist cinema, look to the b&w german films of the silent and early sound eras--films that emphasized canted angles, extreme contrasts of light and dark, exaggerated performance, and occasional uses of surrealism to create a dreamlike atmosphere in order to diverge from traditional, naturalistic modes of cinematic representation. if we're willing to accept that the germans were not the only filmmakers to create expressionist cinema (and that those above-mentioned characteristics are not prerequisites for expressionist film), then i would argue that dodes'ka-den (dkd) is a prime example of this type of film.   like dreams, dkd is a little unhinged for a kurosawa film, dabbling, as it does, in the unreal. however, dkd is also, unlike dreams, a great film and probably my favorite kurosawa picture. why? mostly, i think, it's the colors. this was, i believe, kurosawa's first color film, and the man saturates the movie with vibrant primary colors, creating a completely unreal contemporary japan. we are used to the neon lights and gleaming tokyo skyscrapers; we are not used to a city that appears to have been colored with crayons.   dkd is, as i said, a peculiar film inasmuch as many of its characters live in a junkyard, appearing to live in an alternate universe. that is, i think, the point--these are the tokyo outsiders, the people left behind during the great move forward following world war ii. the film also represents one of kurosawa's more heartfelt movies; there is genuine sentiment here and genuine pathos (such as when the boy's father describes their dream home). it's an amazingly moving film from a man better known for stunning, john ford-like vistas and samurais. everyone should have known kurosawa had in him a movie as touching and thought provoking as this (ikiru foreshadows the emotional resonance of this film in many ways).   i will also argue, to the last, that this is kurosawa's greatest achievement. his samurai films, though capable pictures, pale in comparison to works by kobayashi (hara-kiri is the greatest, most intelligent samurai film committed to celluloid). rashomon, hidden fortress, seven samurai, yojimbo, sanjuro, kagemusha, and ran are all fine films, but they're merely good (and, frankly, i think that word is too generous for hidden fortress and kagemusha). dkd is a great movie, as is ikiru. they are the crown jewels that show akira was not a one-trick samurai pony. they reveal his artistry and mastery of cinema.",1

"a true story about a true revolution, 25 of april ; a revolution against a repressive regime of 41 years, that was imposing a colonial war on it's military's, for maintaining an empire (angola, mozambique, guine-bissau, cabo verde, s. tomé e principe; the first and the last of the great colonial empire's of europe) of 600 years, since it's beginning in the conquest of ceuta in 1415; a revolution by the army for the people, and for a democratic portugal; the most's surprising fact in this revolution is that it were no people killed in it (except those that died in the hand's of pide, the political police of the state, during a brutal gunfire against an unarmed crowd protesting in front of it's headquarters in the day of the revolution, in 25 of april 1974, has it show's on the film).and has all revolutions it has it's heroes, one them of was captain salgueiro maia, a returned soldier from the war, whose convictions along with the rest of the army, was that they were fighting (since 1961) a hopeless war, and that sometimes a soldier has to disobey it's country.",1
"this is a story of the winchester rifle model 1873 ""the gun that won the west"" to cowman, outlaw, peace officer or soldier, the winchester 73 was a treasured possession. an indian would sell his soul to own one...  winchester 73 is the first collaboration between director anthony mann and actor james stewart, a duo that would go on to create a run of superior westerns that added a new, psychological depth to the genre. the story sees stewart as lin mcadam pursuing the man who killed his father. riding into dodge city with his trusty friend, johnny williams {millard mitchell}, lin runs into dutch henry brown {stephen mcnally}, the man he wants. but with wyatt earp {will geer} having taken all the guns from those entering the town, both men are unable to have the shoot-out that they are ready for. the men instead square up in a competition to win a winchester 73 rifle, a competition that lin eventually wins. but before he can leave town with the magnificent prize, dutch ambushes him, steals the rifle and skips town fast. as lin sets off in hate filled pursuit of both man and rifle, the rifle will changed hands a number of times, with each time adding another dimension as the day of reckoning for all approaches.  very much a benchmark for what became known as the so-called ""psychological western"", winchester 73 is basically a story of a decent man driven to borderline insanity by an event in his past. tho shot in black and white {the only one of the duos westerns that was} the landscapes are still breathtaking feasts for the eyes. the tone is set with the opening scene as lin and johnny on horseback, and in silhouette, amble over a hillside as they make their way to dodge city. it's just the starting point that would see mann use his vistas as a way of running concurrent with his characters emotional states.  stewart gives one of his finest and most intense performances as mcadam, proving once and for all that he was one of americas finest and most versatile actors. the support cast isn't too bad either. shelley winters is excellent as the sole female in amongst the machismo, while mitchell, mcnally, geer and the always great dan duryea add further class to proceedings. there's even bit parts for tony curtis and rock hudson in here, tho the latter playing an indian brave is a stretch too far.  originally the film was a project for fritz lang, who even had the script ready to run. but lang walked away from it, something that proved to be a blessing for western fans. for as great as a director that lang was, with mann directing {and with a new script from borden chase & robert richards in hands} it set the wheels in motion to alter the course of the genre. not only with the further efforts that mann & stewart produced, but also in who they influenced. the likes of budd boetticher, nicholas ray and sam fuller were all taking notes, and gleefully for the western purists, they followed suit and carried the psychological torch still further.  a big hit at the box office back on release, winchester 73 is a magnificent film that still packs a punch in the modern age. 9.5/10",1
"errol flynn had one of his favorite roles as the brash braggart from a fighting irish family who went on to become the heavyweight champion of the world at a time when john l. sullivan (ward bond) went around claiming that he ""could beat any man alive."" both flynn and ward bond give what is probably among the best performances they ever gave on screen.  raoul walsh has directed the colorful tale with robust style, capturing the family life as well with scenes that are warm-hearted and full of good humor. all the warner contract players make up the fine cast--including the always reliable alan hale as flynn's rambunctious father, proud of his son's fighting abilities, and alexis smith who makes the most of her role as a feisty society girl who enjoys taking flynn down a peg with saucy one-liners dealing with his conceited manners.  all of the 1880s atmosphere is captured in glorious b&w, although it's too bad warners didn't have more faith in flynn to do the film in color. he was entering a rocky phase of his film career at the time, engaged in a widely publicized rape trial that had all of the tabloids busy sorting things out.  the fighting scenes are among the best ever choreographed for the screen, with flynn obviously in fine form and making very little use of doubles for most of the action. and the scene where bond turns over his award plaque to flynn at a social gathering is one of ward's finest moments in a long career as a character actor.  summing up: maintains interest all the way through, whether you're a sports fan or not.",1
"i gave this 3 stars out of a possible 10 - because the stories are open-ended and left unexplained, and because of the nauseating scenes of someone eating in an extremely disgusting way, plus scenes of a decaying corpse.   neither of the above needed to be shown in such a graphic manner.  the film's plot, such as it is, concerns three loosely interconnecting stories, none of which conclude satisfactorily.  the bounty hunter, played by bruce dern, is the character that connects all three vignettes.  first we have dylan mcdermott, looking darn fine, as a wanted criminal who is fleeing to mexico to escape both the law and the bounty hunter, when he rides through a border town and spots a sad-faced saloon girl played by helen hunt.  then we have one of the hemingway girls, not sure which one, playing a western wife out on the lonely frontier who goes over to see about a neighbor woman, an attractive redhead, whom we soon realize has been out in the badlands a little too long.  the conclusion of the film returns to the bounty hunter and what happens to him, with the final scene in the film being completely beyond rational comprehension.",0

"filmed by mgm on the same sets as the english version, but in german, garbo's second portrayal of ""anna christie"" benefited from practice and her apparent ease with german dialog. garbo appears more relaxed and natural under jacques feyder's direction than under clarence brown's, and her silent movie mannerisms have all but disappeared, which made her transition to sound complete. the strength she brought to the character remains here, although it has been softened, and garbo reveals more of anna's vulnerability. the entire cast, with the exception of garbo, is different from the previous version of the film, and garbo benefits from not having to compete with marie dressler, who stole every scene she was in during the english-language version. in feyder's film, garbo holds the center of attention throughout, although the three supporting players, particularly the father, gave excellent performances.  feyder's direction was more assured than clarence brown's, and his use of the camera and editing techniques did not seem as constrained by the new sound process as did those of brown. the film moves with more fluidity than the english language adaptation, and the static nature of the first film has been replaced with a flow that maintains viewer interest. even william daniels cinematography seems improved over his filming of the brown version. he captured garbo's luminescence and the atmospherics of the docks with style. also, the screenplay adaptation for the european audience made anna's profession quite clear from the start, and the explicitness clarifies for viewers who were unfamiliar with the play as to what was only implied in the brown filming. however, the film was made before the production code was introduced, which made the censorship puzzling.  garbo's oscar nomination for ""anna christie"" was always somewhat mystifying, and i suspected that the nod was given more in recognition of her relatively smooth transition to sound films than for her performance. however, some of the academy voters may have seen the german-language version of the film, and they realized, as will contemporary viewers, that her ""anna christie"" under feyder's direction was definitely oscar worthy.",1

"high heels are tricksy things. they can elevate women (or cross-dressing men) to newfound heights, put forward a sharp statement of style and bring a touch of fragile elegance. alternatively, they can be a perilous foot pain that will inevitably lead to trips, falls and ultimate tragedy. tacones lejanos is more of a disappointment trip than a stylish high riser.  almodóvar's mother-daughter drama is stylish for sure, but in terms of plot it's a tongue-tied and tedious affair full of confusing, complex characters that never fully engage or make sense. a few moments of comedy aside, tacones lejanos just isn't interesting. the best bit comes at the beginning in a marvellously macabre case of manslaughter orchestrated by a child. from this brilliant bit of black comedy things are looking up, but then the film comes to a heel.  there's solid enough acting performances and there's some stylish, arty direction that you'd expect from almodóvar, but otherwise tacones lejanos isn't an impressive piece of spanish cinema. with a story of murder, showbiz, femininity, fractured mother-daughter relationship and a character who is alternately a judge, a transvestite and a police informer this could have been a melodramatic powerhouse. instead it's poor. high heels stumbles for sure.",0
"this ""tragicomedy"" written by famous serbian theatre/film writer dusan kovacevic is probably one of the best movies ever made in the comedy category. and yet, its appearance of a theatre play transformed into a feature film takes nothing of its value. a masterpiece one should not miss to see (preferably with subtitles, and not dubbed).  in an aged bus en route to capital belgrade, a looming war decides the passengers' behaviour. two gypsy musicians sing of their miserable life but also foresee a tragedy to come; their singing both divides and connects stages in this extraordinary road movie (real life kostic brothers are amateur actors, but together with stanojlo milinkovic as farmer who's plowed the road give a real-life performance).  the spectrum of characters gives a brilliant image of a society facing a war, an insight into nation's collective person: everyone is aware that war is just about to begin but they try to live their own lives the best they can, hoping that ignorance might avert the tragedy. using a simple movie language, director slobodan sijan paints a picture of society torn by previous war (world war i), but also highlights personal portraits with success: provincialism of a singer, inexperience of the newlyweds, seriousness of the great war veteran who is on way to visit his recently conscripted son, and gloomy predictions from a man who seems to be a german spy.  brilliant in its narration, with memorable soundtrack (especialy the gispsy songs) and adjusted atmosphere, well photographed and edited, this feature (sijan's feature debut) was only an introduction into a series of the directors bitter-sweet comedies that will define serbian cinematography of the 1980s: ""maratonci trce pocasni krug"", ""kako sam sistematski unisten od idiota"", and my other director's favourite ""davitelj protiv davitelja"").",1
"mulva is put in a sugercoma by teen ape. when she awakens she's considerably hotter (the parts played by debbie rochon in this sequel), and out for revenge on those that did her wrong. as the sub-title and box art implies this is indeed a take off on the ""kill bill"" films, but this being a chris seaver's film, it's a wildly incompetent satire (and i use that last term extremely loosely) i'd love to say this is better than the first film, but truth be told i was so impossibly drunk off my ass when i saw the previous film that i can't even hope to compare the two at this point in time. but i must have enjoyed it since i bought the sequel (see when i'm drunk i like, for lack of a better word, complete and total crappy movies) there are a few laugh out loud moments (very few) but i do remember bonejack being funnier though. well at least at slightly over an hour, it is over mighty quickly for what it's worth.  my grade: d+   dvd extras: audio commentary by director chris seaver, actress debbie rochon, and the lbp gang; second commentary by seaver; 31 minute making of featurette; lloyd kaufman's 6 minute tribute to low budget pictures; fake 2 minute syrup commercial; stills gallery; promo trailer; and trailers for :mulva"", 'quest for the egg salad"", ""fiilthy mcnasty""1, 2, & 3; ""the feral man"", ""the bonesetter"", ""midnight skater"", ""demon summer"" & ""splatter rampage wrestling""",0
"when i went to watch this movie my expectations were really low, but i was pleasantly surprised.   i thought i was going to watch a boring teen-flick, but in fact the plot is interesting and well executed, the acting was somewhat convincing - especially from melville who really shows his talent in this movie, and the fight scenes were - for a low budget movie - very well done .  i think this movie deserves a broader audience than it has received. it is a movie, which can be seen by the whole family - maybe not the smallest of kids, since it contains some rather rough scenes. a movie about love, and the problems that can occur, when you go against your family traditions.   yes, the movie is very much like ""bend it like beckham"", but i actually think this movie pulls it off better.",1
"the poor dvd video quality is the only reason why i gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. that could have been so much better, this movie deserves it.  this is truly a movie that covers several themes simultaneously. if you do not like movies about serial killers, but are fascinated by the astonishing bureaucratic culture in the former sovjet union, this movie is a must-see anyway.  i can't compare it to ""silence of the lambs"" for several reasons. the way the serial killer is portrayed, has been done far much better in citizen x. you see several details of his private life, because you ""travel"" along with the killer, which gives you some idea of the source of his constant anger and sexual frustration.  the only other movie i have seen that is as realistic as this one was ""henry - portrait of a serial killer"". if you were fascinated by that movie you definitely need to take a look at citizen x.",1
"strange... i like all this movie crew and dark humor movies; but didn't like this one at all! it's awful, horrible and surely not funny at all. pity cannot do a whole movie plot, disgust either. and it was really boring. long empty moments fills the movie; it could have been removed. it should have been in another shorter format, surely. maybe i expected too much from the crew - like saving the movie lol -. it's also filled with overused clichés of characters and situations... i don't get it why people liked it...

"as long as there's been 3d technology, (1950's i think) there's been animation made for it. i remember specifically, a donald duck cartoon with chip and dale in it. i don't remember the name at the moment, but the plot was that donald worked at a circus, was feeding an elephant peanuts and chip and dale were stealing the peanuts. this was made to watch in 3d probably 1960's. if you happened to watch meet the robinsons in 3d in theaters, they showed this cartoon before the movie and explained the details of it's origin. there are probably somewhere around 100 cartoons made specifically to be viewed through 3d glasses. this claim was a bad move because it's not difficult to prove them wrong. on top of that, this just looks like a bad movie.",0
"this film, for an after school special, isn't that bad, and that's the problem. nothing happens. you feel as if you're still in class. a guy teaches a bunch of young underdogs how to be good paint ball players. we never get to see these underdogs doing badly as the good player is training them. they all of the sudden turn into good players by meditating. also there are too many characters and no character development. too much time is spend on the main character and his sexy sister and not enough on some of the other kids. this could have had a 'bad news bears' feel (the original) since there was a girl on an all boys team, but there wasn't any feel to this movie at all. it has no feeling and leaves a dull pain in your bones after watching it, is not fun to bag on, not fun to watch, and is just kind of... there. plain. boring. something you'd watch after school before your pre-evening nap. as dull as the day is long and it's been a long, long day watching this movie.",0
"i saw jack frost for £4:00 at my local store and i thought it looks pretty good for a low budget movie so i bought it and i was right it was good. for starters this film is about a killer snowman so that's something to laugh about and the way it looks was funny compared to the snowman on the cover.   the acting was okay and the lines jack frost said had me laughing ""i only axed you for a smoke"" and ""worlds most pi**ed off snow cone"" how funny and camp is that? the tale at the start was pretty funny and silly too ""jack be nimble, jack be quick, jack gouged eyes with candle sticks"". if you're looking for a for a b-movie comedy horror that's full of puns then check jack frost out. 10/10",1
"since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very well-off, it was just scary as to how real it really was! the acting is what gave the movie that push to greatness.  diane keaton portrayed the main character, patsy mccartle who had two sons whom she adored. her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen. it was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugs.  just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard, but so true. i have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie, from what i remember.  i also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman. yet it was done so well. i applaud the director for making this movie.  i highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them.",1
"americans have the attention span of a fruit fly and if something does not happen within the span of a typical commercial, we tend to lose interest really fast.  i found out an exciting fact from this film: someone has to paint high tension utility poles and do it on a schedule! and guess what, they really would like to be doing something else (the viewer has similar feelings).  surprisingly, when i was bored watching late night infomercials and decided to actually watch this film, i found the characters to be interesting and highly engaging.  i just don't usually watch that much late night tv, so i can't recommend this film, unless watching paint dry is your idea of an exciting two hours out of your life.",0
"a bunch of women who can't act sit around, talk, smoke pot. they have another woman in a wheelchair they hide because she is deformed, and occasionally they kill some one to feed this person human flesh that really looks like some store-bought ham which they dressed up by sticking on a few plastic fingers. we don't see them killing anyone, suddenly there is a body on the floor, covered by a bloodied sheet. i can't eat spam cover by a sheet anymore because of this. just the thought of spam cover by a sheet is enough to induce the same narcoleptic fit brought on by trying to get through all of this movie. occasionally there are randomly inserted scenes of a guy who is ""hunting"" them by way of torturing some guy he strapped to a chair is his basement. why he caught this guy and how he is connected to the sit-on-the-couch sisters is never explained. there are also scenes of some ""superhuman"" guy freaking out. he p***es blood and punches through a wall, but who he is or what is wrong with him is neither explained nor even tied in to the story.  there is no action, no special effects, no story. if you want to watch some boring people talk in a profound way about nothing while sitting around and eating ham and smoking, then here's 90 minutes of that, because, except for a scene where one chick does some hooking on a street corner and the aformentioned random scenes, absolutely nothing happens.

"i read tom robbins' even cowgirls get the blues as a teenager. i loved every word. it was sexy, funny, and full of glamorous scenery and beautiful writing. but when i saw the movie, i could not believe what a dull, sour, joyless piece of junk it was. how did this happen? i think someone in hollywood read this book and filed it under ""gay pride -- women -- lesbians."" (that's the library of congress subject heading.) now anyone over 12 who reads the book will know it has nothing to do with real lesbians, any more than star wars is about real space travel. the book was obviously -- and i do mean obviously --written by a heterosexual male who loves the idea of lesbians (in the nude, all the time)but has never really met one.  still, someone in hollywood said, ""uh oh, better give this to a gay director or gay people will make trouble."" so they handed it to gus van sant. nothing against the man, but -- however gay he may really be -- he has not a clue as to how to make a funny film. gus van sant took a straight man's playful fantasy of guilt-free girl/girl action and male voyeurism turned it into a dull, literal-minded lesbian power recruiting poster. it's like turning an oscar wilde comedy into an arthur miller tragedy. not pretty.  the main clue that gus van sant had absolutely no idea what to do with the source material is the riotously bad casting. his clout allowed him to hire the very best. his ignorance of the novel's real subtext (a straight man's fantasy, not a gay pride recruiting poster)caused him to make choices that were not only bad, but bizarre.  let's meet the cast of even cowgirls get the blues.  pat morita as ""the chink"" okay, there are few name-recognition asian actors. and pat morita, in happy days, was fairly funny. but casting him as the chink was wrong, wrong, wrong. pat morita has no idea that the chink is a very funny man. (gus didn't tell him.) pat also doesn't seem to know that the chink is . . . well, sexy!!! in the book he's not wise old mr. miyagi. he's more like hugh hefner! he's a randy old goat and he knows a lot about pleasing the nubile and responsive sissy and bonanza jellybean. (you see, in the book, they aren't really lesbians. do you get that this is a straight man's fantasy yet?)   john hurt as ""the countess."" okay, he's a gay friendly man. but he is a serious, shakespearean actor!!!! you need someone who is fun, and camp, for this role. for john hurt to be cast as a goofy guy like the countess is tragic and sad. i kept expecting paul scofield to wander in all dressed up as thomas more, and sadly shake his head. ""now, richard, you know you've lost your soul entirely. for shame, my former student!"" and yes, john hurt was funny (and pretty gay) as caligula. but that was black humor, not playful and breezy humor like the book.  rain phoenix as ""bonanza jellybean."" no talent, no training, no problem. except that in the book bonanza is funny, playful, cheerful, (mostly) heterosexual, and loving. in the movie she's sullen, passive, expressionless, and dull. as for her taste for women, robbins in the book puts it like this. ""god knows i love women, but nothing can take the place of a man that fits."" uh, gus? did you read this book?   uma thurman as ""sissy hankshaw."" this is a tough role. in the book sissy really is an unusually passive and timid heroine. still, a more accomplished actress might have manufactured a twinkle in her eye, or a sway in her walk, to imply some sort of hidden strength or hidden enjoyment of her adventures. uma doesn't pull it off, probably because gus never told her sissy is supposed to enjoy being a hitch hiker with a beautiful body and giant thumbs. uma plays it more like she's in a tv movie about a girl dying of leukemia.   this movie is sour and dull. and i accuse you, gus van sant!",0

"after ""beau travail"", everybody was waiting for claire denis to make a follow-up masterpiece that never arrived. now it has. denis makes a quantum leap in this film, an orgy of gorgeous cinematography, elliptical editing and willfully obscure narrative events that feels strange and acts even stranger. there's a nominal plot (derived partly from the jean-luc nancy book of the same name) about a mature man in need of a heart transplant and who seeks a tahitian son he abandoned long ago; but mostly it's an exploration of the idea of intrusions personal and cultural. it takes a couple of viewings to fully comprehend, and has pacing problems close to the end, but it's still more advanced and gripping than anything else i've seen this year. miss it at your peril.",1

"spoilers herein  my high school did all they could to try and motivate us for exams. but the most memorable method they used to get us into the right state of mind was a guest speaker, who was none other than australian kickboxing's favorite son, stan ""the man"" longinidis. the first mistake they made was giving this guy a microphone, because he was screaming half the time despite us sitting no more than 3 or 4 feet away from him. now, his speech was full of the usual ""if you fail to prepare, then prepare to fail"" stuff, but there were various instances where i got really worked up. the guy stood there in front of us preaching how throughout his life he did everything for himself and no-one else. he was offered many deals in the past to give up kick-boxing, but he never took his eye off the prize of becoming australia's greatest kick-boxer. he said that he wasn't a sell-out, he was happy and a retiree, he wasn't ever involved in any other activity other than kickboxing then he plugged his film. yes, you heard right, he plugged his new film. as he talked about it, he got a woman to come in and hold up a poster advertising it, and then he showed this shitty 4 minute clip of this vile film called ""trojan warrior"". (this all being before he was defeated by gurkan ozkan in his final career fight (for now))  stan plays ajax, a kick-boxing ex-special forces agent that is pulled into the seedy underworld of melbourne. ajax's cousin, theo (arthur angel) recently sold out (well, at least stan didn't stray too far away from everything) to the feds, and as a result is on the run from all walks of organized crime. ajax and theo get into all sorts of ridiculous situations, from fighting in a kebab shop to posing as playboys at a bondage party. it's all pretty ridiculous, but if silverstein was actually aiming to make a credible film here, this man should never be handed a camera again.   i'll admit, i was actually pumped to see this. i love action films, even if they're corny, and especially if it's set in my own backyard. but what i was introduced to was a film with acting that was appalling from the word ""go"", and continued to do so after the words ""for the love of god please make it stop!"", subplots were introduced and not even touched on again after they were out in the open, characters were just thrown in for absolutely no reason whatsoever, and the most over-choreographed fight scenes that didn't even remotely reflect stan's actual talent in kickboxing. the cast consisted of useless cameo appearances by just about anyone remotely famous (dermot brereton, mark ""chopper"" read and greg matthews). the whole time you're sitting there and playing the guessing game of just who is standing there in the background. too bad the movie relies heavily on split-second appearances by former celebrities. remember those plot-holes i told you about? ajax once upon a time was apparently locked up, wrongly accused for murdering his wife. now, we hear that ajax was in special forces via one single sentence in the whole film, and then leave it for buggery. this is followed by another single sentence which persuades ajax to help the same people who wrongly locked him up. then, get this, at the end, it is revealed to ajax that his wife isn't actually dead, but was sold into prostitution. do we see her? no. does ajax go off to find her as soon as he hears this? no. now that's a marriage!   amidst all this irritatingly puerile crap, some website described this film as ""a cross between jackie chan & guy ritchie"". has this man ever sat down and watched a jackie chan film?! chan shows more dexterity taking a dump than stan did doing, well, anything! and guy ritchie is the crime-film messiah, and you're comparing him to salik silverstein!? this film is more like a mix between ""pizza"" and ""enter the ninja"".   now, where do you thing the whole ""trojan warrior"" title comes from? ajax's fierce fighting skills like that of an ancient greek warrior? no. the gangsters' unification to find theo, like that of the trojan empire? no. it's because wait for it theo carries a condom around with him. yes, that right, because theo is always prepared with a trojan brand rubber in his pocket, he is a trojan warrior!   i had the displeasure of seeing ""trojan warrior"" on dvd, as well as it's ""special"" features:    video clip of ""chop chop"", a rap song by mark ""chopper"" read: chopper did this for the sole purpose of proving that anyone can rap. the funny thing was chopper just rapped for 30 seconds and then threw it over to these two albino teens from doncaster, using such words as ""dis"" and ""dope"" etc in their australian accents. face it people, rap was developed in the states, leave it there! the clip looked like something a channel 31 cameraman on ecstasy put together.    bloopers: there was no real difference between these and the actual film.    stan ""the man"" longinidis kickboxing featurette: this wasn't too bad, considering it was just 6 or 7 different fights shown from different angles (i think i saw dennis alexio fall over about 15 times in that 3 minute montage).  i don't want to say this film contributes to the reason this country is going to hell when it comes to film, but... oh wait, i just did. my advice to anyone reading this is for you to go out and buy 4 or 5 copies of ""trojan warrior"", tape them together, and use it for a paperweight, because this movie is just that damn bad.",0
"remarkable, disturbing film about the true-life, senseless, brutal murder of a small-town family, along with the aftermath, and examination of the lives of the killers, dick hickok and perry smith.  no matter how much time goes by, or how dated this film may look, it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as this.  this really traces multiple tragedies: the tragedy, brutality and senselessness of the murder of the clutter family, a decent farm family in small-town holcomb, kansas; and the wasted, brutal and sad lives of hickok and smith.  an interesting point is made in the film: that neither of these two immature, scared, petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone. but, together, they created a dangerous, murderous collective personality; one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them. they push each other along a road of ""proving"" something to each other. that they were man enough to do it, to carry it out; neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big ""score""; an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led. these were two grown-up children, who live in a criminal's world of not backing down from dares; who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness. in this instance, these needs carried right through to the murder of the clutters.  the film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the clutter family, but the point is made. these were respected, law-abiding, small-town people, who didn't deserve this terrifying fate. the movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of hickok and smith. perry smith, whose early life was filled with security and love, but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path. hickok, poor and left pretty much to his own devices, not able to see how he fit in, using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact with.  an interesting, and maybe the first, look at capital punishment, and what ends we hope to achieve. is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us, or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these? is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit, operating under the radar, believing they fool everyone they come into contact with? to be deterred, you must believe it's possible you will be caught. is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught?; who have committed hundreds of petty crimes, and got away with them? this was supposed to be a ""cinch"", ""no witnesses"".  when caught, hickok finds he can't charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks. smith, who believes he deserves such a fate anyway, who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done, willingly tells the story when he learns that hickok has cowardly caved in. hickok blinked first. a silly game of chicken between two immature, emotionally damaged, dangerous men.  fascinating psychological thriller, telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nation's history. stunning portrayals by robert blake and scott wilson. these roles made their careers.",1
"in my honest opinion, everyone should see this movie at least once. it really put things in perspective as i watched it. though it was fictional, this movie is about something that could happen to your children.  it shows how easily two kids can hide both their hatred for their school, and their plans to murder innocent students. this film would not have worked in any other format. they pulled off the hand-held camera, perfectly.  it reminds us of april 20th, 1999, when eric harris, and dylan klebold murdered 12 students and then themselves. it also reminds us of the media storm that followed after. everyone wanted to see the rampart video and everyone wanted to see the basement tapes.  this movie is a fictional version of our dreams coming true. we get to see the kid behind the monster.  the only bad thing about this movie, is that it did not do well on the market, and few people even know it existed. if it would have had a single preview on a single blockbuster movie, everyone would have gone to see what the big deal was about, zero day.  i believe this is the best film adaptation of a school shooting of the few that have truly attempted it. the shooting itself only takes up about ten minutes of the hour and a half long film, because it mostly focuses on cal and andre, and what they did up to that point.  if you have not yet seen this movie, go rent it, and watch it. i guarantee that when it is finished, you will be speechless.",1
"talk about a dream cast - just two of the most wonderful actors who ever appeared anywhere - peter ustinov and maggie smith - together - in ""hot millions,"" a funny, quirky comedy also starring karl malden, robert morley, and bob newhart. ustinov is an ex-con embezzler who gets the resume of a talented computer programmer (morley) and takes a position in a firm run by malden - with the goal of embezzlement in mind. it's not smooth sailing; he has attracted the attention of his competitor at the company, played by newhart, and his neighbor, maggie smith (who knows him at their place of residence under another name), becomes his secretary for a brief period. she can't keep a job and she is seen throughout the film in a variety of employment - all ending with her being fired. when newhart makes advances to her, she invites ustinov over to her flat for curry as a cover-up, but the two soon decide they're made for each other. of course, she doesn't know ustinov is a crook.  this is such a good movie - you can't help but love ustinov and smith and be fascinated by ustinov's machinations, his genius, and the ways he slithers out of trouble. but there's a twist ending that will show you who really has the brains. don't miss this movie, set in '60s london. it's worth if it only to hear maggie smith whine, ""i've been sacked.""",1
"this show is a perfect example of how the cbc should stick to either news, sports, or satirical sketch comedy. as a developer of situation comedy, cbc has shown it can combine the pizazz of ""king of kensington"" with the belly laughs of ""the beachcombers"". it is an embarrassment to great shows like ""kids in the hall"" and ""second city"" that they have to share their comedic roots with this lame production.  i have to admit, that i didn't give this show much of a chance right from when i first heard of its concept. to start, half of the concept is a direct attempt to rip-off one of the few sitcom successes in english-canadian history, ""corner gas"". the rest of the concept--the cultural clash--is far from being original and is too often used as a crutch for screen writing laziness. the selection of the muslim religion as the basis for the ""fish out of water"" characters seems to be a desperate attempt to be ""edgy"" and ""topical"", but comes off as forced. some of the jokes that are based around the local's reaction to the newcomers are cringe inducing and thoroughly insulting to the intelligence of everyone involved, especially the audience.  this show is a perfect example of how cbc just doesn't ""get it"" when it comes to creating canadian content, especially when presenting canada as a multicultural environment. cultural diversity in canada does not have to be presented in such a heavy-handed and forced way. it would be a refreshing change to see cbc introduce diversity into a television show without making the show all about said diversity. i doubt that cbc has sufficient sitcom talent to pull off something so subtle. a comparison could be made to the way diversity is depicted in corner gas--i.e. the aboriginal characters are not set apart by their ethnicity nor is their heritage used to generate story lines. more realistically, their lives and the other characters lives intertwine in a way that makes ethnicity no more significant than any of their other personal characteristics.  that being said, even as a formulaic fish-out-of-water comedy this show fails. the acting is weak, the comic pacing all over the map, and the story premises that i saw were too far beyond the suspension of belief, even for a comedy. the only saving grace is the talented derek mcgrath, who is horribly wasted here. i doubt that even the addition of guest stars (colin mochrie, for example, as an anglican archbishop) can save this dog. i decided to give the show a chance once the cbc's 'hype' had died down; but two episodes were all i could stand--i could almost feel my braincells shutting themselves down with each failed punchline. the time-slot would be better served by airing more coronation street, air farce re-runs, or dr. who. even an infomercial would be an improvement.",0
"first, an explanation: despite my headline, i'm giving this film only 8 stars because overall this is not one of the best films ever made. all the criticisms registered here have valid points. also, be warned that to enjoy the script you really need to appreciate neil simon's brilliance with finding the wit within real human banter. he does have a distinctively new york ear for dialogue -- especially dry, jewish, love-suffused sarcasm -- and if you have trouble accepting sarcasm as an expression of love, then you might have trouble accepting the optimism at the heart of this movie.  so much for warnings. here's my main point: walter matthau is flat-out perfect, even beyond perfect, in this movie. i have never seen him funnier, or more touching for that matter -- because at the same time that he shows us the hilariousness of this character who refuses to give up his big star self-image or insufferable attitudes even as his coherence is in decline, he also shows us the more vulnerable, maybe even heartbreakingly scared person inside the grouch. and he only barely shows us that sad part -- it's just enough to really get to you if you happen to be coping with your own father's or husband's mental decline right now (i mention this as a warning), but artistically, it's just enough pathos to give this character the most authentically deep roots i'm seen in possibly any film performance. this is beyond method acting -- matthau's performance is exquisite as character work and a pure delight as comic delivery. this is a masterpiece of comic acting.  about richard benjamin: i personally find his acting annoying in general, and his work in this movie is no exception -- although he has some fine moments here. (""chicken is funny...."" is one of them.) so if you like him, you should like him here, and if you don't this movie won't change your mind.  about the 1976 oscars...i agree that matthau was unfortunate to be up against nicholson in ""cuckoo's nest"" that year. it was a killer year for leading-actor competition; if only there were separate oscars for comedy and drama, then i think the best actor oscars would have gone to al pacino for ""dog day afternoon"" and to walter matthau for ""the sunshine boys"" -- not to dis jack's fine work as mcmurphy, but i think that pacino and matthau were each clearly more masterful and astoundingly effective and downright legendary in their performances than nicholson was that year. also, i believe that burns got the supporting actor oscar more for sentimental reasons than for the quality of his performance -- i mean, he was good in this movie, but not that good. (burns's fine-as-ever but unexceptional-in-itself return to show biz beat brad dourif's truly brilliant debut in ""cuckoo's nest,"" not to mention chris sarandon's stunning debut in ""dog day afternoon"" -- which i think proves my theory.)   oscar theories aside, here's my bottom line review: if you like matthau's comic acting, then see this movie and savor his powerhouse tirades and wonderful grandmother-inspired gestures, fleeting facial expressions and seemingly unscripted asides. (but if you're currently dealing with the pain of watching an old person lose his grip, then be warned that this movie might either be the comic relief you need or a dose of reality too painful to watch right now.)",1
"this is a family film, which to some people is an automatic turn off. it seems that too many people do not want to see films that are not loaded down with failing arms and legs, gratuitous violence and enough expletives to fill the new york phone book. this film is none of those. it is cliché, it is formula, but it is also fun. it doesn't ask you to think, it doesn't demand that you accept the film as reality. it simply does what a good film ought to do, which is to willingly suspend disbelief for two hours and enjoy the adventure. the cast is good, while not excellent. as another commenter pointed out the john williams sound score was, as usual, excellent. and the fact that a lot of the film was shot in huntsville at the real space camp made it even more believable.   it was ironic that the original release of the film was delayed for some months due to the challenger shuttle disaster, which may have played a large part in it's original theatrical opening, but the film eventually has helped to focus the dreams of many young people back towards space and the possibilities that lie therein. so sit back with your kids and prepare to enjoy.",1
"incredible documentary captured all the frenzied chaos and misery which loomed over nyc on that fateful morning of september 11th. intense, personal, and completely riveting, 9/11 is perhaps the greatest documentary ever made by accident, which kind of gives it an even greater appeal. up until that morning, filmmakers gideon and jules naudet had been following around a new york firefighter team, concentrating specifically on one new recruit in a little piece they were shooting dealing with the rigorous training to become a fireman. out with the team that morning filming yet another simple routine cleanup, jules lifts his camera up to the sky just in time to record one of the only known images of the first plane hitting the world trade center, and from there a simple documentary was no more.  viewers are given a first hand account of what it was like to be in and around ground zero, as the amazing group of fire-fighters and one profoundly bewildered cameraman attempt to navigate this disaster. without hesitation, naudet follows these automatically programmed heroes into the tower while it's entire support crumbles around them. the raw fear of an unknown, impending doom lurks with more viability then any fictional production could ever fathom as we watch less and less become audible and visible for those trapped inside. nearly as memorable is older brother gideon's candid capturing of an entire city in the throngs of a larger and more palpable fear then anything they had collectively witnessed. by the time we get to see the second tower collapse, as the cameraman shields himself from apocalyptic debris, we should all but be rinsing the dirt off ourselves from the amazingly up-close footage captured.  obviously the filmmakers deserve only as much credit as being in the right place at the right time to document such an extraordinary event, though one can only admire the two brothers in their extraordinary adaptation to such an event; in a few desperate minutes we witness them become like the firemen they document- only instead of saving lives they knew they had to save footage, even if it cost them their own safety.  after viewing 9/11, and seeing that it came out in 2002, i feel much more resentment towards oliver stone's recent rendition, the big budgeted world trade center. many had criticized the film for ignorantly narrowing down the focus to those two survivors trapped in rubble, and although i enjoyed the movie just fine for the small and sentimental hollywood focus it brought, 9/11 all but renders his film completely obsolete. not only will this utterly gripping footage remain the only definitive collection from that day, but the sublime transfer of motives midway ensures that this documentary has all the heart and character needed to never sensationalize the event again.",1
"......this film is pretty awful, the only thing stopping me from giving it a rating of 1 was the fact that i unfortunately have seen worse.  the jungle music, juttering demons, and fluorescent uv style blood/teeth/eyes give it that ""awful"" look, and the script is dire.....this film is more like a test to see how long you can last before giving up on it. it's also predictable but not in a good way. nothing this film does is in a good way. i watched it 10 minutes ago and thought i would rant a bit so there you are.

"the reasons to watch this knock off... err... tribute to a great movie called se7en: - it's on while your channel surfing and there's nothing else on. - someone pays you to watch it.  do yourself a favor and pop in the dvd for se7en, rent it, download it on itunes, or put it in your netflix cue and skip the flock entirely. the flock the same story with with a few changes. furthermore the editing just wreaks of se7en and actually ends up taking you out of the story several times. the worst one is probably the fly over desert helicopter shots, with sounds of people people chattering over the radio, except there are no police helicopters flying overhead in this one.  bottom line: i call it a blatant knock off. if you wanna be nice you can call it a tribute film, go ahead, but either way go watch se7en.",0
"first of all, this film was not released to theatres (tested poorly they say),i say they figured the story of crooked cops, politicians & dedicated newspaper people had been done to death,just send it dvd & cable tv> & take the money & run.  that being said i usually like this type of movie, especially with this named cast. morgan freeman, justin timberlake, kevin spacey,  l.l.cool j, cary elways, john heard & on the distaff side, piper perabo & roslyn sanchez.  the plot & story have been done to death, but the above cast brings life to this violent movie & it is actually watchable.  justin timberlake is good as the dedicated young reporter for a throw-away newspaper edited by morgan freeman, the others are either crooked cops,& politicians or somewhat decent guys, the 2 ladies are the girl friends of ll cool j & justin timberlake & do whats required, it is quite violent, many killings etc, not for children. by no means is the a great film, but for what it is & the cast it is definitely good,  ratings *** (out of 4) 86 points (out of 100) imdb 8 (out of 10)",1

"don't spend your money or your time on this pitiful piece of film in the guise of cinematography.when every third word is devoted to foul language and there is no real plot as well as having a cast of old actors who are still giving the same dated performances from the past and have not evolved in their careers, leaves a lot to be said. i was expecting something better from award winning actor benicio del toro. the vision that others may have of puertorricans will be irreversibly distorted by such trash as maldeamores. a foul word at a given moment in a film may be used to emphasize a given point of view and may even be funny or sad depending on its context (see the movie elsa and fred for example) but it should not permeate the plot. the movie is a total embarrassment and there was absolutely nothing funny or even cute about this film.",0

"if you have any kind of heart and compassion for people, this is a tough movie to watch, at least in the second half of it.   it's in that segment where we see nice little kid get beaten up and then a retarded (mentally- challenged) man go off the deep end after he witnesses this brutal act against the child. it's not pleasant material.  however, it's a good movie and the acting is good, too. the story will sit with you awhile.  ""dominick"" is the mentally-disabled guy and is played by tom hulce. i think this might be hulce's best role ever. he's looked after by a med student, ""eugene,"" played by ray liotta, who became a star the following year with kevin costner's ""field of dreams.""  dominick is a goodhearted garbage man who reads ""hulk"" comic books and loves wrestling. he's the type of ""slow"" guy that you can't help but love and root for to live a happy life. when he freaks out, it's for several good reasons and...well, see the film for the whole story. it's worth your time but be prepared to go on real emotional roller coaster and possibly be very upset at some things you see.",1

"before george clooney directed sam rockwell in his directorial debut ""confessions of a dangerous mind"", they starred together in this movie. george clooney also was involved with this movie as a producer, along with steven soderbergh, which shows that they really believed in this project. in potential this also seems like a fine and entertaining project, that is in the same line with movie-remakes such as ""ocean's eleven"" and ""the italian job"" but somehow this movie is only halve successful, or at least it isn't as good as it could had been.  the movie its characters are all being played by some fine well known actors but a shame is that the characters are not really given enough room to develop. even though in their potential they could had turned into fun and enjoyable characters, they are now only characters that mildly entertain because mostly of some of the more quirky sequences that are in the movie. the fact that they are being played doesn't change much to this, even though they prevent their characters from ever becoming a total bore or perhaps even annoying, or anything like that at all.  it's of course due to the writing that the characters aren't used to their full potential. i can only assume that the original italian movie ""i soliti ignoti"" works out much better than this movie does. the movie relies too much on its simple story and predictable way of storytelling.  nevertheless the movie is simply still a very fun one to watch maybe because of that very same simplicity. it's an harmless little caper movie, in which you simply shouldn't to worry much about the story. in that regard ""welcome to collinwood"" is still a movie that works out and simply serves its purpose well.  it's a movie that you won't regret watching once you've finished it but it also is a movie you can really easily do without ever seeing.  7/10",1

"this movie really woke me up, like it wakes up the main male character of this bravely different movie from his life slumber.  this guy john (ben chaplin) leads his mediocre safe life of a bank teller in a small provincial english town, until the stunningly gorgeous, wild, girl-to-die-for nadia (nicole kidman), ordered by email from russia, enters his life to become his beloved wife, by johns plan. however a glitch turns up - nadia does not speak a word of johns language. although calm and emotionless on the outside, john becomes so interested in beautiful nadia that instead of using the full refund policy of the matching service, he buys her a dictionary to start the communication process.  what happens henceforth in the plot really shakes poor john from his slumber of a decently-paid safe-feeling clerk into a decision-making decently thinking action figure, giving the viewer a subliminal message ""you would have probably acted likewise"".  kidman, cassel & kassovitz make a great team acting russians and they are almost indistinguishable from the real thing, ""almost"" only due to the slight accent present in their russian dialogues, however slight enough to amaze a native russian by the hard work done to get the words sound right. nicole kidman proves her talent once again by playing a character quite different from the previous roles, at least from the cultural background.  the pace of the film is fast and captivating, and you certainly are not ready to quit watching when the end titles appear, you rather feel that you're in the middle of the plot, and are left with a desire to see the sequel as soon as it comes out.  my advice is to go out and get this film immediately and watch it and enjoy. to sum it up, it has an unusual plot, great acting, and ideas below the surface. like the idea of the ""rude awakening"" from the artificial safe routine life of a wheel in a society's machine, the life which members of the fight club were so keen to quit and the machine of which pink floyd sings (""welcome to the machine!""). i bet that in the end, john was rather off with sophia on their way to the unknown than not having met her at all.  thank you, writers, for the great story, and everyone else for this great movie! please make a sequel! and you can stage it whereever and name the location whatever, because the authenticity of the place is irrelevant to the 99.9999 percent of the potential viewers, i am sure of it.",1
"well, of course not, women are overly sensitive and needy on average, which is interestingly portrayed from mother to whore, though not pseudo-artistically, extravagantly, or blatantly dwelt on. unlike many of you i have only seen la maman et la putain twice. as many good films, i noticed my opinion of it improved after a second viewing. all that i know is what i have seen and have yet to delve into further exploits until i myself have acquired the dvd. i have yet to figure out precisely why i enjoy this movie so much, but really, what do i care why? though i'm sure i could and will form some wonderful explanation. all right, so you may disagree, perhaps it is a bit boring at times, i'm not an expert. the blonde reminds me of a lovely grushenka.",1

"this is is a thoroughly unpleasant, if slickly made, movie. i tried it because it stars richard dreyfus and jeff goldblum, two good actors, and because the plot line - a mob boss is about to be released from a mental institution - sounded promising. the movie is billed as a comedy, sorta. what we have is an endless series of shots - you should pardon the pun - of people in dimly lit and elegant, if somewhat surreal, interiors, shooting each other - in the head, stomach, kneecap, foot, heart (no part of the anatomy is avoided, it seems) while uttering vague and cryptic dialogue, some of which is supposed, evidently, to be humorous in a sort of post-modern way. goldblum's dialogue for the whole movie could fit on a 3x5 card, and he wears a single facial expression - a sardonic grin - throughout. ellen barkin and gregory hines do the best they can. burt reynolds does a cameo. the credits list rob reiner and joey bishop, but i somehow missed them (good move on their part). the whole thing is cold, sterile, mechanical and unsavory; an heir, i suspect, to the style of 'pulp fiction', 'fargo' and 'natural born killers'. if you liked those, you'll probably like this.",0

"to be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence, but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the cgi was a little old hat now. maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too.. to say this was awful is to do this film a mis-service, if you want to see something that is totally execrable, you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching 'sickle', that is soo mind numbingly awful, its actually good,(several large alcoholic beverages are deriguer though. any road up, i enjoyed this film and its gotta be worth a look if you have not seen it yet, just don't expect anything along the lines of 'jurassic park,the lost world' or 'apocalypto'.",0
"cq is incredibly slow, and i'm a david mamet fan. the movie follows around a young filmmaker who is making a very barbarella-esque film. after that the movie started to lose me. deep and profound? not really. the movie ""dragonfly"" being made in cq has the problem of having no ending. this greatly parallels cq, which also lacks an ending (in my opinion).  i was lucky enough to catch this movie at the sxsw film festival. i had fairly high expectations having just watched y tu mama tambien and several other great movies. i was also looking forward to jason schwartzman's performance. but it was not an easy film to get into. if you're not into 60's sci-fi or slow movies that go no where, skip it.  cq feels like a student film. if you want a recent sci-fi-esque indie film rent donnie darko, it won't put you to sleep.",0
"basically the exact same movie as ""house of wax"" - vincent price's first genuine horror hit released the previous year - but seriously who cares, because ""the mad magician"" offers just as many sheer thrills, delightful period set-pieces, joyous 3-d effects, sublime acting performances and macabre horror gimmicks as its predecessor! ""never change a winning team"" is exactly what writer crane wilbur must have thought when he penned down price's character don gallico, another tormented soul besieged by fate and out for vengeance against those who wronged him. don gallico is about to perform his very first own illusionist show as gallico the great and plans to exhibit the greatest magic trick in history; entitled ""the girl and the buzz saw"". gallico's promising solo career is abruptly ruined before it even begins when his previous employer ross ormond appears on stage and shoves a contract under his nose, stating that all of gallico's inventions are the rightful property of the company. the sleazy and relentless ormond, who by the way also ransacked gallico's once beloved wife, takes off with the buzz saw trick and programs it in the show of gallico's rival the great rinaldi. inevitably gallico snaps and sadistically butchers ormond, but  also being a master of creating disguises  recreates his victim's image and even starts leading a double life. ""the mad magician"" is an amusing and thoroughly unpretentious 50's horror movie in grand guignol style, with a whole lot of improbably plot twists (the landlady turns out a brilliant crime novelist?) and a handful of fantastically grotesque gross-out moments (although they obviously remain suggestive for most part). the 3-d delights near the beginning of the film, like a yo-yo player and a goofy trick with water fountains, merely just serve as time-filler and contemporary 50's hype, but it's still fun to watch even now and without the means to properly behold them. ""the mad magician"" is also interesting from a periodical setting point of view, as the events take place around the time fingerprints were starting to get used as evidence material and the character of alice prentiss is an obvious reference towards famous crime authors of that era. needless to state that vincent price remains the absolute most essential element of triumph in this film, as well as from nearly every other horror movie this legendary man ever starred in. like no other actor could ever accomplish, price depicts the tormented protagonist who gradually descends further and further into mental madness in such an indescribably mesmerizing way. you pity don gallico, yet at the same time you fear him enormously. you support his vile acts of retaliation and yet simultaneously you realize his murderous rampage must end in death. vincent price simply was a genius actor and, in my humble opinion, the embodiment of the horror genre.",1
"i watched this film because i'm a big fan of river phoenix and joaquin phoenix. i thought i would give their sister a try, rain phoenix. i regret checking it out. she was embarrasing and the film just has this weird plot if thats what you want to call it. sissy was just weird and jellybean just sits on a toilet who both sleep with this old man in the mountains, whats going on? i have never been so unsatisfied in my life. it was just total rubbish. i can't believe that the actors agreed to do such a waste of film, money, time and space. have sissy being 'beautiful' didnt get to me. i thought she was everything but that. those thumbs were just stupid, and why do we care if she can hitchhike? whats the point??? 0 out of 10, shame the poll doesnt have a 0, doesnt even deserve a 1. hopefully, rain is better in other films, i forgive her for this one performance, i mean i wouldnt do much better with that film.",0
"i had lost faith in sooraj r. barjatya after the movie main prem ki deewani hoon, then a year back now i saw promos for vivah which looked good. but i didn't want to waste my hard earned money watching it in cinema. when the film first came out on dvd i rented it and watched and i loved the movie and took back my words for sooraj. i just finished watching it yesterday again and this time i thought i have to review this movie. sooraj r. barjatyagot it right this time, okay i was not a huge fan of hum app ke hai kaun. but i have always loved manie pyar kiya, after manie pyar kiya to me i think vivah is barjatyas best work. i hardly ever cry in a movie but this movie made me feel like crying. if you have ever been in love before then there will be many moments that will touch you in this movie, the movie is just too sweet and will have you falling in love with it, my view a much underrated movie.  the story of this movie you might call desi and very old times, but to me it seemed modern because the two couples which are getting an arrange marriage are aware it's an old tradition. it's done in present times, lots of people don't believe in this arrange marriage, but i do. the journey between the engagement and wedding which will always be special and this movie shows it clearly. when prem meets poonam for the first time, they show it how it is and that's reality and my parents where saying that's how they got married and it showed it in a way which is so real yes people the way prem and poonam meet in this movie is how most marriages happen. it was a very sweet, you feel nervous yet excited, the song ""do ajnabe"" shows that very well. getting back to the story yes it's a journey which you soon get glued to between prem and poonam (shahid kapoor and amrita rao) and there families. a twist occurs in this movie which is really good, the last 30mins you all will be reaching for the tissue box.  what makes this film so amazing is the chemistry between prem and poonam, how they fall for each other is too sweet. simple boy and simple girl, when they first meet during and after the song ""do anjane ajnabe"" it's very sweet to watch, she hardly says anything and prem does all the talking being honest with her about his past and the girl he liked and him smoking. then it leads on to them all having a family trip and then that's when they really do fall for each other. it makes you just want to watch the couple and watch all the sweet moments they have. another factor is that poonam chichi is really mean to her and you feel sorry for poonam because she has been treated bad and makes you want to see her happy and when she finally finds happiness, you too start feeling happy with her the movie basically makes you fall in love with poonam more then just prem. when she finds happiness through prem you want her to stay happy and also hope nothing goes wrong because the character is shown as a sweet simple girl. which brings me to performances and amrita roa as poonam is amazing in the movie, her best work till date you will fall in love with this innocent character and root her on to find happiness. shahid kapoor as prem is amazing too, he is poonam support in the film, he is her happiness the movie, together they share an amazing chemistry and i have never seen a cuter couple since srk and kajol. if ishq vishk didn't touch you to telling you how cute they are together this surely will. ""mujhe haq hai"" the song and before that is amazing chemistry they show. scenes which touched me was when prem takes poonam to his room and shows her that's where they will be staying and he opens her up and they have a moment between them which is too sweet. again if you have ever been in love with someone that much these scenes you can defiantly connect to. the film is just the sweetest thing you will see ever.  the direction is spot on, to me a good movie is basically something that can pull me in and stop me believe for this hours what is being seen here is fake and there is a camera filing them. to me this film pulled me in and for those three hours i felt really connected to the movie. the songs you will only truly like when you have seen the movie as they are songs placed in the situation after i saw the movie i been playing the songs non stop! the music is amazing, the story is simply amazing too what more can i ask for?  what i can finally say it, rarely do we get a movie that makes us feel good, this movie after you have seen it will make you feel really good and make you want to be a better person. its basically the sweetest journey ever, its basically showing you they journey between engagement and marriage and many people say it's the bestest part of your lifewell this movie actually shows you way do people actually say that? why do people actually say that the journey is just that amazing! watch this movie and you will find out why the journey is amazing!",1
"i've always enjoyed seeing chuck norris in film. although the acting may not be superb, the fight scenes are fantastic. i also enjoyed seeing judson mills perform along side him. in my opinion, the norris brothers have proven themselves to be fine entertainers and this was yet another fine production! i hope you take the time to view this movie!",1
"this may be the worst film adaptation of a broadway musical ever. even the music has been destroyed. attenborough knows nothing about theater - almost every shot and moment ring false. i will say, though, that it is almost bad enough to be funny.  the hairstyles are remarkably dated. i can not for the life of me understand what is meant (conceptually) by opening the film with an exterior of the theater where ""a chorus line"" is playing. are we to think that these people are auditioning for ""a chorus line,"" which contains the stories about the people who are auditioning? oh no, the show is collapsing on itself.  i saw the original production, and have listened to the album hundreds of times. why, oh, why, did they do this?",0
"the film was shot at movie flats, just off route 395, near lone pine, california, north of the road to whitney portals. you can still find splashes of cement and iron joists plastered across the rocks where the sets were built. and you'll recognize the area from any randolph scott movie.  i won't bother with the plot, since i'm sure it's covered elsewhere. the movie stars three athletes -- fairbanks fils, who must have learned a good deal from his dad -- grant, an acrobat in his youth -- and maclaughlin, a professional boxer from south africa. their physical skills are all on display.  not a moment of this movie is to be taken seriously. it's about thugees, a sect in india, whence our english word ""thug."" i can't go through all the felicities of this movie but probably ought to point out that the director, george stevens, was a polymath with a background in laurel and hardy movies -- see his choreography of the fight scenes -- and went on to the infinitely long dissolves of shane and the diary of anne frank. dynasties rose and fell. geological epochs came and went, while liz taylor and monty clift kissed in ""a place in the sun."" here, in his comic mode, he excels.  this is a story of male bonding and it would be easy -- too easy -- to read homoeroticism into it, as many people do with howard hawks. or hatred of women. but it isn't that at all. sometimes things portrayed on screen don't deserve too much in the way of heuristic attention. men will form bonds by working together in a way that women do not. (women share secrets.) read deborah tannen, nobody's idea of an anti-feminist. well, when you think about it, that's what evolution should have produced. for most of human history -- about nine tenths of it -- hominids have been hunters and gatherers, and the men tend to hunt and the women to gather. hunting is more effective as a team enterprise. men who were not very good at bonding were darwinianed out, leaving men who have a lot of team spirit. and grant, fairbanks, and maclaughlin have got it in spades.  sorry to ramble on about evolution but i'm an anthropologist and it is an occupational disease. did i ever tell you about the horse in vaitongi, samoa, that slipped on the cement and fell in the bathtub with me? you've got to watch the hooves.  joan fontaine is lovely, really. only got to know her in her later years and wondered why she was in so many movies. i lived in saratoga, california, where her sister, olivia dehavilland, grew up and went to a convent school. pretty place.  if you miss this adventurous lively farraginous chronicle of the british empahh at its height, you should never forgive yourself. it's so famous that it's parodied in the peter sellers movie, ""the party."" yes -- the colonel's got to know.",1
"the movie concerns about philip(leslie howard)he's a serious but handicapped medicine student .he falls fatally in love with a heartless, predatory waitress called mildred(bette davis).she leaves him ,engaging with others(alan hale,reginald denny).meanwhile he is romanced with another suitors(kay johnson,frances dee)but she goes back in a mutually destructive affair.  easily the best and first of numerous films versions of somerset maugham's novel. bette davis as the cockney cruel waitress winning yet another magnificent interpretation with an alluring and smouldering performance ,absolutely hypnotic in her account of the bondage that occurs from the beginning to the finale.davis rose the stardom with her performance.her role as tough and crude domineering woman will be repeated several times in posteriors acting . leslie howard as the essentially good and decent student subtly destroyed gives an excellent and melancholic performance.he was an awesome actor(gone with the wind)besides producer and writer and dead in plane crash during wwii. both will play again in ¨petrified forest¨(1936). the atmosphere film is elaborately recreated in the rko(radio picture inc) studio is entirely convincing. remade in 1946 by edmund goulding, with eleanor parker and paul henreid; and in 1964 by ken hughes with kim novak and laurence harvey . the motion picture will like to classic cinema buffs. rating : very good but a little bit dated.",1
"a drifter looking for a job is mistaken for a hit man in a small wyoming town, leading to all kinds of complications. cage is perfectly cast as the unlucky schmuck hoping to make a quick buck and get out of town but finding he can't escape the title town. hopper does what he does best, playing a psycho known as ""lyle from dallas,"" the real hit man. walsh as a crooked sheriff and boyle as a femme fatale round out the fine cast. the script by brothers john and rick dahl contains delicious twists and turns, and john's direction creates a terrific ""neo noir"" atmosphere. witty and very entertaining, it sucks the viewer in from the start and never lets up.",1
i went to see antone fisher not knowing what to expect and was most pleasantly surprised. the acting job by derek luke was outstanding and the story line was excellent. of course denzel washington did his usual fine job of acting as well as directing. it makes you realized that people with mental problems can be helped and this movie is a perfect example of this. don't miss this one.,1
"this is a strong movie from a historical and epic perspective. while the story is simple it is pure and straightforward. in truth, it is the standard story of a simple, honorable man whose honor comes into conflict with the more educated and wealthier men of the period.  poor vs. rich, honorable vs. dishonorable, a classic but well-told tale without much of the glitz of hollywood stinking up the screen.  extra points just because you can almost smell the people on the screen. :)",1
"*i mark where there are spoilers! overall comments: if you can take a serious movie, go see this. have an open mind and you will enjoy it. don't leave the theater because you get confused as to what is going on! the movie fits together nicely in the second half. i will be taking my mom to see it again when the movie officially opens.   i was lucky to see this at a screening a couple of weeks ago, when will was going around promoting the movie. he was great--spent a lot of time with the fans. thank you for the picture will! about will's performance: a lot of times when you see a movie with an actor really famous for some other movie/show, you always think of them in their current performance much like you think of them for their past performance. this is not the case with will smith in this movie. i didn't picture the fresh prince (lol) when i was watching this movie. he was completely and utterly convincing in this very, very serious role. he has grown immensely as an actor. i think he will at least get an oscar nod for this performance.  about his character: ben is very conflicted and tormented. he's sad...guilt-ridden...very determined, but very scared. very true to himself. his character has a lot of depth...and somehow, will managed to bring that to life.  about emily (rosario): rosario did a nice job portraying emily, a woman very much behind on her taxes. maybe she's not the shining star will is in this movie, but she was very convincing. i think her character just did not have as much to work with as will's did.  about the plot (no spoilers): i admit that i did not like the movie until the second half of it. i knew absolutely nothing about the movie going into it, and nothing made sense until the second part of it or so. but when things eventually fit together, wow. surprisingly well written and well thought out. it's an extremely intense movie that really sticks with you.  it actually takes a lot out of you to watch. in the theater i was in, most people were crying towards the end--even grown men. when you realize what ben is doing, and why, it's a very powerful moment...  ******* minor spoilers***** which is why it's really hard to talk about the plot without giving major things away. i feel like knowing too much about this movie really ruins it. there was a lot of symbolism in the movie that i enjoyed, though. i will mention some of it here (without trying to give a lot away).  -the fish that ben was keeping in his hotel room. at first, it makes no sense whatsoever. there was a lot of chatter in the movie theater when people realized the reality of the fish.  -i hated ben at the beginning of the movie. by the end of it, i loved him and hated him. that's how convincing will was. i thought ben was being a huge jerk to ezra, a blind man just trying to make his way in the world. why he was treating ezra like that also became abundantly clear later in the movie. wait it out though. everything in this movie: wait it out.  -ben is a fundamentally good person who made a big mistake that he won't forgive himself for. it's still unclear to me if he was doing what he was doing because he was trying to rid himself of his own guilt, or if he genuinely wanted to help people. i think it's a little bit of both...i think he wanted to help people but also rid himself of his past. i love his character. you love him and hate him because you realize that what he is doing is nothing short of amazing. you hate him because of what he is doing to himself (as a very good person), both physically and emotionally. nice job will.",1
"i enjoyed this film. but i was surprised to see people referring to it as a comedy. it was amusing at times, but really, it wasn't very funny at all. if i'd been expecting it to be a comedy, i might have been disappointed with the film, but, going in with no expectations, i found it to be enjoyable and engaging. maybe it was because, as an engineer, i identified with the protagonist. i was less concerned with satire of capital or labor, and more into the basic story of a man fighting for his invention. a man who's less interested in monetary gain from his invention than he is in seeing it come to fruition and be put into production. he's absolutely heroic when he refuses to take the big money and the hot woman in return for suppressing his invention. so i find it interesting that people here have compared it to jurassic park; me, i compare it to the fountainhead.",1
"this movie had me going. the title was perhaps the greatest idea that i heard. i thought it was an independent movie about a zombie outbreak and their quest to take over the us and a group of lone survivors, band together, and plan to take out the zombies. dead wrong! it's about a psycho cop with a weakness for killing his female arrests gets what's coming to him when a pack of zombie women rise from their graves in order to get proper revenge. as you can see there is nothing about the nation nor a county involved. where to begin with the severity this cinematic disaster caused our nation.  first off, the zombie women look like victoria secret models with dark eyeliner and a pale face. what are zombies but mindless, debatable intelligent, cannibalistic killing machines that eat as a result of their primitive most basic needs? these zombie women walk like streetwalkers and runway models, they talk as if they are in a poor film noir movie and not do they act like real zombies. sure the eating and killing is there, but where is the mindlessness and the horrible disfigurement? although it is a very interesting concept and perhaps a great satire on the zombie genre, it makes fun of that genre and asks the question, ""why can't zombies be beautiful vixen killing machines?"" i would say that this movie would be considered a really bad indie movie that was produced and made by garage junkies. i would not recommend this movie to anybody that loves zombie genres too much, it's an insult and as for scarynot even.",0

"i saw 'new york: i love you' today and loved it! i was really looking forward to seeing this after watching 'paris je t'aime' and overall i think i liked this one much better... perhaps i need to watch 'paris je t'aime' again i don't know... i read few of the reviews here about ny:ily and yes, the movie is not without its faults. when you're paying tribute to a city like new york - it can get rather overwhelming and nothing seems fair enough to do the city due justice... so without elaborating on any of the film's shortcomings, i'll just write about what i liked.  unlike 'paris je t'aime' in which each director's short film was properly segmented and titled, ny:ily isn't and many reviewers over here have found the seamlessness of stories and overlapping of characters here annoying and even confusing. i thought otherwise. i loved how the stories just flowed one after the other and i especially liked the overlapping of characters - it might be gimmicky because it's done so often in films now. but i still liked it because i didn't find it forced. and the idea that we're all connected in the end has a wistful, even whimsical quality to it - which some might find corny but i find beautiful.  i liked all the films but the one that touched me the most was the one by yvan attal with robin wright penn and chris cooper. it was so well-acted and scripted that the reveal in the end - again not unused in the past - brought me to tears and i was crying throughout the segment that followed. i always liked wright penn and now i'm also a fan of chris cooper. those precious initial few seconds when he's standing alone outside the restaurant, just before he gets the call - speak volumes about cooper's ability to convey a character by just being there without saying anything.  most of the stories in this film involve characters who are either meeting each for the first time or have met each other just recently with the exception of 4-5 stories in which the characters have known each other for a long time. it seemed to me (and i might be wrong) that the stories were different but they were all trying to drive home the point, the need even, to just step back and view in a new light the people and the things we've known in our lives for a long time; to see the people and the things around you with the eyes of a stranger and appreciate them just as you did when you met them and saw them for the first time.  the other films that i liked were the ones by shunji iwai with orlando bloom and christina ricci, by natalie portman with carlos acosta and taylor geare, by brett ratner with anton yelchin and olivia thirlby, by shekhar kapur with julie christie, shia labeouf and john hurt and once again the one by yvan attal with ethan hawke and emilie ohana when they're in the café. i really need to see more work by yvan attal as i seem to like him a lot!   overall, watch this movie with an open mind. don't read the reviews before watching it! it might not live up to your expectations of what a movie on and about love in new york should be and i doubt any movie will really live up to that conception. just watch this movie for some good music, beautiful landscape cinematography, some slice-of-life comfort and a story or two that might just tug at your heartstrings.",1
"slasher films are often seen as the derivative, repetitive and frankly unoriginal. i happen to to be a horror movie fan, but this film was just so poor, words fail me. the script is severely lacking, the plot is ridiculous, the acting astoundingly bad. just an all round stinker, that i wasted time of my life on. this had all the entertainment value of a 15th sequel to a film that was dire in the first place.   who greenlit this mess?  i only liked two things in this movie. the first was the killer's mask - which was nice. the second was the austrailian affinity with humourous profanity.  save yourself, and avoid this hideous mess.",0
"this must be one of the most overrated spanish films in history. its lack of subtlety and complexity and its total political correction make it really childish, with only good/bad characters. the world is just not like this, and good movies show complex characters with opposite impulses, dilemmas, etc. however, what i hate most about this film is bola's friend's father. the director tries to teach us a good lesson: tattoo artists with shaved heads are not always bad guys, in fact they can be better than the average looking dad (wow, this is like... philosophy, or something). thank you, achero. i'll propose you for the nobel prize of literature.",0

"the case is the best part of the movie but it alone is not worth the purchase price. i expected a ""based on the true story"" movie only to find a shot on home video hodge-podge of poorly shot clips tied together with pathetic acting and non-related slaughter house scenes. the video scenes had numerous rewind situations which were used probably to extend the length of the feature rather than for effects. i started this review before i was even halfway through the movie and waited till it was over just in case it had a better ending but, low and behold it only got worse. if i could mark it any lower it would have been a negative ten. learn from my mistake and save your money and time with this one.",0
"this film is one of the finest american b-movies of the 90s. if you're looking for a serious film, look elsewhere. however, if you're looking for some action, a lot of laughs, and a tongue in cheek variation on cops fighting gangsters, this is well worth watching. everyone chews the scenery a bit, but that's really what the film is all about, and everyone is quite funny. donald sutherland and john lithgow have great chemistry and need to do another film together.",1
"having just watched this film again from a 1998 showing off vh-1, i just had to comment.  the first time i saw this film on tv, it was about 1981, and i remember taping it off of my mother's betamax. it wound up taping in black and white for some reason, which gave it a period look that i grew to like.  i remember very distinctively the film beginning with the song, ""my bonnie"", as the camera panned over a scene of liverpool. i also remember the opening scene where paul gestures to some girls and says, ""look, talent!"" so it was with great irritation that i popped in my 1998 taped version and ""remembered"" that the film opens with ""she loves you"", instead of ""my bonnie"". when you see how slowly the camera pans vs. the speed of the music, you can see that ""she loves you"" just doesn't fit. also, in this ""later"" version when paul sees the girls, he says, ""look, girls!""..and somehow having remembered the earlier version, that word just didn't seem to fit, either. why they felt they had to americanize this film for american audiences is beyond me. personally, if i'm going to watch a film about a british band, i want all of the british colloquialisms and such that would be a part of their speech, mannerisms, etc.  another irritation was how ""choppy"" the editing was for television. just after stu gets beaten, for example, the film cuts to a commercial break-lots of 'em. yeah, i know it depends on the network, but it really ruins the effect of a film to have it sliced apart, as we all know. what some people might find as insignificant in terms of dialogue (and thereby okay to edit), may actually go the way of explaining a particular action or scene that follows.  my point is, the ""best"" version of this film was probably the earlier version i taped from 1981, which just so happened to include the ""shake, rattle & roll"" scene that my 1998 version didn't. i started to surmise that there had to have been two different versions made for television, and a look at the ""alternate versions"" link regarding this film proved me right. that the american version had some shorter/cut/different scenes and/or dialogue is a huge disappointment to me and something worth mentioning if one cares about such things. imo, ones best bet is to try and get a hold of the european version of this film, if possible, and (probably even less possible), an unedited version. sadly, i had to discard my old betamax european version because i didn't know how to convert it.  all that aside, i found this film to be, perhaps, one of the best films regarding the story behind the ""birth of the beatles"". being well aware that artistic and creative license is often used in movies and tv when portraying events in history, i didn't let any discrepancies mar my enjoyment of the film. sure, you see the beatles perform songs at the cavern that made me wonder, ""did they even write that back then?? i don't think so"", but, nevertheless, i thought it was a great film and the performances, wonderful.  the real stand-out for me, in fact, was the actor who played john, stephen mackenna. i just about fell in love with him. his look, mannerisms, personality and speaking voice seemed to be spot-on. he looked enough like a young john for me to do a double-take towards the end of the film when you see the beatles performing on ed sullivan for the first time. i actually found myself questioning whether or not it was actual beatle footage, until i saw the other actors in the scene.  if you're looking for a dead accurate history of the beatles' life and beginnings, you can't get any better than, ""the beatles' anthology"", as it was ""written"" by the boys', themselves. however, if you're looking for a fun snapshot of their pre-beatlemania days leading up to their arrival in america and you leave your anal critical assessments at the door, you can't go wrong with the ""birth of the beatles""--a must for any ""real"" or casual beatle fan.",1
"that's what the title should be, anyway.  this movie combines guns, explosives, and mindless killing to make one flop of an ""action"" movie. let me make my point in a series of questions: answers type deal.  what happens in the movie? people die.  is that it? yes.  what is the plot about? what plot?  what is the point the movie is trying to make? killing is the only solution.  what are the characters like? extremely flawed and contradictive toward their own personalities.  is there anything good about this movie? yes. i'm sure they used some nice panavision cameras in filming it.  if you like constant killing and greed, then watch the movie. if you happen to be repulsed by such low-standard ""entertainment"", then ""made men"" is not for you.  to sum it up, the plotline stinks, the characters aren't worth their while, the storyline is completely resistable, and nothing fits together.  this proves one thing: the actors, directors, and whoever helped make this movie certainly aren't ""made"".",0

"what we have here is a damn good little nineties thriller that, while perhaps lacking in substance, still provides great entertainment throughout it's running time and overall does everything you could possibly want a film of this nature to do. i saw this film principally because it was directed by john dahl - a highly underrated director behind great thrillers such as the last seduction, rounders and roadkill. i figured that if this film was up to standard of what i've already seen from the director, it would be well worth watching - and red rock west is certainly a film that dahl can be proud of. the plot focuses on the overly moral michael; a man travelling across america looking for work. he ends up finding it one day when he stumbles upon a bar in red rock county - only catch is that the job is to murder a man's wife. he's been mistaken for a killer named lyle, but instead of doing the job; he plays both sides against each other and eventually plans to make a getaway. however, his attempts to escape are unsuccessful and he finds himself in a bad situation when the real lyle turns up...  john dahl appears to enjoy setting thrillers on the road; he did it three years earlier with kill me again, and again almost a decade on from this film with roadkill. it's not hard to see why dahl chooses this sort of location, as it provides a fabulous atmosphere for a thriller the likes of this one. dahl also provides his film with a 'film noir' like atmosphere, as the plot mainly focuses on the central character and the word he is plunged into is full of dark and mysterious characters. the acting is largely very good, with nicholas cage doing an excellent job in the lead role, and getting a-class support from lara flynn boyle, j.t. walsh and, of course, dennis hopper; who once again commands the screen with his over the top performance. it has to be said that the second half of the film isn't as gripping as the first, but red rock west certainly is never boring and the way that dahl orchestrates the grand finale is excellent in that all the central characters get to be a part of it. overall, red rock west is a film that you're unlikely to regret watching. it's thrilling throughout, and you can't ask for much more than that!",1
"this show seemed to be kinda good. kyra sedgwick is an ok actress and i like police series, but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong.   first of all, the writers should have more suspects than one, you know who did it every time!!!!! that makes it boring. the main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way. i know they wanted her to be tough, but shes mean, stupid and a bad chief. the crimes are uninteresting and bland, and its just lame all the way. as stated above, i hate it....   all in all, this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed...",0
"the message of a world on the brink of war is disregarded by the masses; the mythical city of everytown in 1940 represents england in general, but it could just as well stand for any nation of the world. when war finally does arrive, it's ravages continue not for another five years, but until 1966 at which time everytown is completely destroyed. adding to the desolation and toll on humanity is the ""wandering sickness"", a pestilence that continues for another four years.  ""things to come"" balances both a fatalistic and futuristic world view, where science holds out a hope for a revived civilization. the ""wings over the world"" concept plays out a bit corny, though it's spokesman cabal (raymond massey) is unwavering in his mission and dedicated to his cause. if he fails, others will follow. this message is continually reinforced throughout the film, brought home convincingly in massey's end of movie speech. man's insatiable need to test the limits of knowledge and achievement requires an ""all the universe or nothing"" mindset.  the film's imagery of automation and machinery in the second half is reminiscent of the great silent film ""metropolis"". as everytown is rebuilt and transformed by the year 2036, the spectacle of the city's rebirth strikes a resonant chord, as architecture of modern cities of today suggest the movie's eerily prophetic vision is coming to fruition. where the movie gets it wrong by sixty seven years though is man's first mission to the moon, but in 1936, a hundred year timetable probably seemed more legitimate than 1969.  ""things to come"" is one of those rarities in film, a picture that makes you think. which side will you come down on, the forces for advancement in the face of uncertainty or maintain the status quo? it's not a comfortable question, as both choices offer inherent dangers and unknowable outcomes. those who choose to be bystanders risk being swept away by forces beyond their control.",1
"""darkness"" was entertaining to some degree, but it never seemed to have a plot, lacking one more so than other films that have been accused of this detriment; i.e. ""bad taste"". it started off really good, with a man running from something. it was very creepy for these first few minutes, but after a time the film just became entertaining on the level of gore, which was hard to make out at some points due to poor lighting and horrible recording quality anyway. the film was hard to believe because of the juvenile acting, which most of the time, seemed like some friends talking to a video camera, making lines up as they went. that, with a lack of any plot whatsoever, made it look like the film was started without, and ended without, a script of any kind. as said before, gore was this film's only drawing point, which much of the time was hard to make out.",0
"twist endings can be really cool in a movie. it's especially interesting when the twist is right in front of our eyes, but we just don't pay attention. those type of twist endings are the one's that make people think. then we've got twists like this film has. twists that, whether or not you pay attention, you have no clue what's going to happen. when they reveal this kind of random twist, instead of shock, it's somewhat a dumbfounded reaction. this film starts off like it's going to be an interesting take on horror, but after about 20 minutes, it's nothing but boring dialogue and a stupid twist.  three young women are going to a concert, so they get lost traveling through the woods, and hit a tree trunk. they end up at some old creepy lady's house, who hates men, and they are greeted by her homely daughter marion (laurel munson). strange goings on happen as these girls stay at this house for several days instead of trying to leave or get home, and the suspense progresses into a dumb slasher.  this film is too caught up in it's dialogue, and it's always between only a few characters. we have the main three girls, the creepy spinster and the old lady, and conversation of any importance does not go beyond these five. to make matters worse, they never have anything interesting to say. it's actually quite maddening sitting through their conversations. we want to know what's going on, and instead they just talk and talk and talk (about nothing).  plot holes are abundant here. the house these girls stay at when they get in their car accident is apparently three miles from anywhere...wow, three miles! a two hour or less walk will kill them. why didn't they get a ride with the worker for this household who was driving into town? did he have a one seater? how come these girls never question leaving and just willingly stay, rarely even checking up on each other? why did this have to have so many dumb twists? maybe the answers are in the boring script.  having a slasher film with five characters is really a bad idea. it's not thrilling, it's not scary, and the ending is definitely out there, but undoubtedly dumb.  my rating: * 1/2 out of ****. 79 mins. r for nudity and violence.",0
"this film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized. there are two routes to take in horror films: either you don't really explain what's going on (or who the killer is, like in texas chainsaw massacre) or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained (halloween could potentially be an example of this).  unfortunately, creep fails in this area. i see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation. no character is fully realized, although the circular nature of kate's character in the film is the most accomplished part of the story.  in the end, this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty film-making that drag down the film.  this film will go down as another example of a film (as most are) that could be so much better even though it would never be great. the only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting: the characters, story, direction, and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face lift.  creep does serve a purpose as a mindless, silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment, but sadly, that's about it...",0

"david and bathsheba is a lavish hollywood biblical picture produced out of 20th century fox by darryl f. zanuck, directed by henry king and starring gregory peck {king david}, susan hayward (bathsheba), raymond massey (nathan), kieron moore (uriah) and jayne meadows (michal).  the film is based around the second old testament book of samuel from the holy bible. it follows king david, who as a child had slain the giant goliath, and now we find him in adulthood as the second king of israel. a tough and assured king, david however has affairs of the heart causing great problems. for once he spies bathsheba taking a shower {re;bath}, it 's the start of a journey encompassing adultery and betrayal; a journey that will end in the judgement of god being called upon.  typically for the genre, david & bathsheba is a large, grandiose production. from its excellent set designs to it's positively gorgeous technicolor photography {leon shamroy}, it has enough quality to warrant sitting along side the best the genre has to offer as regards production values. untypically, tho, the film is sedately paced and relies on 99% of its worth being driven purely by dialogue. this is not one for action fans or anyone who needs some swash to go with their buckle. this is a very humanist picture, in fact lets not beat around the burning bush here, it's a biblical love story flecked with sins of the heart. but that is no bad thing at all, because breaking it down we find it's very well acted {peck has a stoic yet vulnerable thing going on real well & hayward is pushing it to the max}, and it be a fine story directed with knowing skill by the often forgotten henry king. and although some of the dialogue is admittedly cringe inducing, the character flow is never interrupted as phillip dunne's (the ghost and mrs. muir) oscar nominated screenplay holds the attention throughout.  sometimes a forgotten picture in terms of the biblical/swords & sandals genres (most likely because it is a talky piece that has heart as its main selling point), but really it's well worth the time of anyone interested in the most lavish of genres. 7/10",1

"(big spoilers) i've seen one other takashi miike film, and that was the very disturbing and brutal 'audition', which was an examination of the japanese ideals of femininity! in 'visitor q'- which i think means 'visitor question'- he examines, in a very disturbingly gross way, the family unit. miike's surreal vision of a dysfunctional family almost tries to be lynchian in terms of confusion and film-making, but ultimately lacks the style and intrigue. we, the audience, are introduced to a bizarre array of scenarios from the opening scene with the father figure (kenichi endo- who was actually quite good) paying for sex with his displaced daughter (fujiko). then, as the father returns home, he is struck on the head by ""the visitor"" (kazushi watanabe) wielding a fairly sizeable rock, and for some reason, they both end up back at the family home. the mother (shungiku uchida) is beaten and bullied by her son (jun muto) who is also beaten and bullied by his school peers. when the visitor enters the home, he somewhat menacingly establishes himself as part of the unit. eventually, the family begin to improve their relationship, with assistance from the visitor, through milking breasts, murder and retaining a sense of family pride.  and there are other crazy scenes that somehow bring the family closer together. it's has uncomfortable humour, but is equally frustratingly silly, and over-the-top in its weirdness. there is a necrophiliac scene that is utterly disgusting, but ends up being ridiculously funny as the scene progresses. partly because of the situation itself, and partly because you can't believe the filmmakers and the actors are actually doing this! the style of the film is poor to say the least, and the plot is stupid and unbelievably weak. the characters themselves are all over the place, and while i understand this is not meant to be realistic, there is hardly any interest in these confronting characters and situations as all of them border on the absurd! the camera-work is sloppy, and doesn't have that cinematic feel that lynch's work entails. it's hard to take this film seriously on a surrealist level, or on an interpretation of examining the family unit in japan. it just seems that miike was out to shock, and the film seems self-aware that it's ""trying"" to be shocking, and it becomes almost comical to be taken seriously. all in all, i would say that this film is a bizarrely dark comedy, but it looks and feels amateurish, and seems to unnecessarily want to shock. miike's previous film, audition, was finely balanced between disgusting horror, character development and technique- which established more intrigue in the way the film was crafted to allow the viewer to become engrossed with the plot. 'visitor q' is a step down as it tries too hard to be outlandishly bizarre and intentionally confronting, without really having much to say in the process!   ** out of *****!",0
"one of the most underrated movies i've seen in a long time, bill & ted's bogus journey is the second hilarious adventure of bill s. preston esq. and ted theodore logan, aka wyld stallyns. there are two ways to look at this film: first, you see dumb dialogue, far fetched plot, juvenile idea. or.. you see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains. throw a bruce willis or a arnold schwarzeneggar into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie. bill and ted go into the story with the same level of sincerity, only it's bill and ted. this is a tricky fence to balance on, but when you watch the movie not as a throwaway screwball comedy, but as an adventure featuring two guys who have no business being in an adventure, it becomes so much more.",1
"david mamet's film debut has been hailed by many as a real thinking-man's movie, a movie that makes you question everybody and everything. i saw it for the first time recently and couldn't understand what was supposed to be so great about it.  the movie is about a female psychologist named margaret who is also a best-selling author. margaret has become disillusioned by her profession and her inability to really help anyone. she tries to rectify this by helping settle her patient's gambling debt to a shark named mike (played by joe mantegna, who is the only reason to watch this film). she discovers that mike is actually a professional confidence man when she nearly falls victim to a scam he pulls immediately after meeting her. intrigued, she returns to see him and asks him to show her how con artists operate (she plans on using this as the subject of a new psychology book). she then falls for him and accompanies him on a long con that he and his associates have set up.  i don't feel like going into details, but at the end of the film it is revealed that the events of the whole movie were an elaborate con by mike and his cronies to swindle margaret out of $80,000.  first of all, the big twist towards the end was very predictable. any scene where the con men were operating was made very obvious by the stagey acting and weird line reads. not only that, but the audience (and the main character) knows that they're dealing with con men, so is it really such a big surprise when we find out that margaret has herself been conned? besides, margaret is supposedly an intelligent psychologist who is an expert at reading people, yet she allows herself to be duped far too easily -- and keep in mind, she knows full well that mike is a con artist.  secondly, we are led to believe that margaret was conned from the very beginning, yet in order for the con to ultimately work, she had to do several things that the con men couldn't possibly have predicted that she would do. first, she had to decide to help settle her patient's debt, allowing her to meet the con men in the first place. if she hadn't done this, the entire con would have failed. i just have to say that it's pretty unreasonable to assume that a psychologist is going to take it upon herself to settle a patient's gambling debt. not only that, but what are the odds that the con men would be at the right spot on the very night she decided to show up? did they simply show up at that bar every night, hoping she would come and see them? another thing that had to happen that couldn't have been predicted is that margaret had to return to see mike again and ask him to teach her the tricks of his trade. what are the odds of this happening? and yet the whole con is based on this premise.  another problem i had is with the ending. margaret finds out she's been conned and decides to get revenge on mike. at first, mamet leads us to believe that she's going to con the con, but that falls through, so the ultimate ending is her gunning mike down in an airport baggage area. somehow that just felt like a clumsy and inept way to end a movie about con artists plying their trade. not only that, but she didn't even take back the money he stole from her.  ultimately, the movie leaves you feeling empty and unfulfilled. and if you, like me, predicted ahead of time that margaret was going to be conned, you will find this revelation just as unsatisfying.",0
"i was but a babe in arms when george lucas was wowing the world with his out of this world saga chronicling the adventures of young luke skywalker and the notorious darth vadar but even today 20 years on i can appreciate the genius that is lucas and the incredible imagination he's been blessed with. in a new hope lucas showed a new way to tell stories as he introduced us to such memorable characters as the plucky princess leia, the rougish han solo and the spirited luke skywalker as well as that best loved of villains, the sinister darth vadar. in the empire strikes back he went all out to show us special effects can add to a tale and managed to something no-one thought you could do on screen. he made a film with no specific end or beginning and it went down a treat. return of the jedi is a fitting end to a saga that will stand the test of time.  when the empire srtikes back ended with encasing of the lovable rouge han solo in carbonite to be delivered to jabba the hut and young luke reeling from the discovery of a terrible truth about his father we were left with the feeling that things were going from bad to worse. vadar it seemed had won the day. how we asked could the rebels ever recover from this blow? in lucas stunning and captivating final chapter we are kept on the edges of our seats from han's daring rescue from jabba's palace to the the final climactic battle on the death star between luke and vadar as luke struggles between fulfilling his duties as a jedi and rebel fighter and attempting to reawaken the good he believes is still in his father's soul.  old friends like the smooth talking lando calrissian and the ever lovable chewbacca reunite for one final battle to end all battles as a new darker more dangerous enemy emerges in the form of the emperor himself ( played by the brilliant ian mcdiarmiud.how he missed out on an oscar is a mystery.) desperate to turn luke to the dark side even if it means betraying his apprentice darth vadar.all in black with his red eyes,ghostly white disfigured face and sinister laugh he truly is a terrifying addition to the story and is the undisputed master of the events that unfold. his new and improved death star spells disaster for the rebels but the brave group launch one last desperate attack to end the empire's reign for good.   lucas managed to incorporate three different stories at once and keep the action going so that the audience is riveted. we watch in excitement as han and leia attempt to bring down the shield around the death star from the forest moon of endor with the help of some adorable ewoks ( who i really do not believe take from the movie at all. in fact i feel they provide a sort reprieve from the tension of the battles at and in the death star) and hindered by legions of stormtroopers and imperial officers. we cheer on lando and the other pilots as they take on the mighty imperial fleet and risk life and limb to fly into the deatn star to destroy it once and for all. and we watch with bated breath as vadar and the emperor attempt to turn luke to the dark side while he in turn tries to turn his father back.  but for me the most difficult and yet compelling battles is that going on inside darth vadar. for rotj is a battle of emotions and feelings. vadar is caught between his loyalty to the emporer and the empire and his fatherly inclinations to luke. never did i think that a mask could show emotion but some-how one can't but see the confusion and pain on vadar's face during the final scenes as the emporer turns on luke. there is more depth and emotion to vadar than i believed a villain, especially one more machine then man could have and that i think is what makes him so accessible. he is conflicted. the apprentice as much as the master. the victim as much as the villain. without ruining the end too much vadar's final scene is the most poignant and wonderful in the trilogy.  so in conclusion what can i say. george lucas is the master of the saga. star wars is the most compelling and engaging sagas i've seen in a long time and i have yet to see another saga rival it. return of the jedi has all the ingredients necessary to provide the ending lucas masterpiece deserves. it's action, suspense, romance, tragedy, redemption, joy all rolled into one and it's memorable characters, wonderful special effects and catchy music make both a great movie in its own right and an ending that lucas can be proud of.",1
"the choke starts as a rock band known as the choke prepare for a gig at a nightclub called 'club 905' owned & run by guy johnson (andrew parker). lead singer dylan (sean cook) & guitar player mike (jason mckee) plan to tell the other band members, bass player london (brooke bailey) & drummer nancy (tom olson), that they are both going solo & their services won't be needed any longer. once at the club dylan prepares but mike doesn't show up & the gig turns into a disaster. then just as the band think things couldn't get any worse they find a dead body in the cellar, that all the doors have been locked so they can't get out & that they can't trust anyone as a mysterious killer begins picking them off one-by-one...  produced & directed by juan a. mas the choke is a standard by-the-numbers teen slasher that really doesn't have anything going for it. the script by jessica dolan & susannah lowber (not too many horror films out there penned by ladies...) has some surprisingly good character's in it & some nifty dialogue but while it's much better than a lot of modern shot on a camcorder type horror in that respect it's so slow & boring that even a few interesting character's can't come anywhere close to saving it. as one would expect all the usual teen slasher clichés are used, from the isolated location the victims can't escape from, the cast of good looking teenagers who keep splitting up, a few murders & a really poor twist ending that tries to mimic something like scream (1996) & be surprising but doesn't make a whole lot of sense when you think about it logically (they couldn't have done some of the things they were supposed to) & to make matters even worse i guessed who the killer was fairly early on & even though i don't want to boast i was spot on. then there's the fact that the makers of the choke felt that it's audience would be entertained by showing endless (well it feels endless while watching it) scenes of teenagers walking around dark corridors doing nothing in particular, i am sorry but there is only so many scenes like this that i can take before it starts to become tedious. the kill count is low, at first they all decide to stick together (good idea) but then they all just randomly decide to split up & go their separate ways (bad idea when there's a killer on the loose), the pace is lethargic, the kill scenes are unimaginative & to top it all off the twist ending is poor.  director mas does alright, the film looks ok for the most part although there are the odd occasions where he uses some annoying post production editing technique like slow motion or frame skipping. the gore levels aren't really up to scratch, there's some blood splatter, a guy with a hole in his chest, a few dead bodies & someone impaled on some metal poles. most of the kills happen off screen with the axe kill at the end a good example of the film not actually showing anything. since the film is about a rock band there's quite a rock orientated soundtrack with some truly horrible, horrible rock songs used on it. i am sorry rock fans but to my ears this crap is just noise pollution. it's not scary, there's no real atmosphere & the lack of blood & gore is just inexcusable when the rest of the film is so bad.  with a supposed budget of about $1,000,000 the choke is well made with reasonable production values, it looks cheap to be sure but not as cheap as many low budget horror films look. shot in a place called spokane in washington apparently. the acting is one of the films strongest points as it's generally pretty good all round, i mean no-one is going to win an oscar but it ain't half bad.  the choke is a throughly routine scream style teen slasher that has one of the weakest twist endings ever & a criminal lack of blood, gore, violence, nudity & dead bodies. i mean if a slasher hasn't got any sex or gore then what's the point? those are the only things that the average slasher is worth watching for, right?",0
"fortunately for us real mccoy fans (most likely all baby boomers who grew-up in the late 50's and 60's), three of the adult actors/actress appeared when they did for the reunion show, in 2000. tony martinez and richard crenna both died shortly thereafter. as enjoyable as it was to see luke, sugar-babe, and pepino together again, it was equally mysterious about the complete absence of any mention of lydia reed and michael winkleman? it is my understanding that little luke had passed away in 1999, but i'm not sure how. there is no information about hassie on the internet, that i can find. very curious why they were not even mentioned? it was so conspicuous, their absence from the reunion show, that i suspect that the family of michael and lydia herself (if still alive) either, 1) requested to be left out of the discussion and therefore their desire was granted, or 2) tnn could not find any trace of either michael or lydia (like the rest of us), they seemed to have vanished. therefore, it would be the safest policy to leave them out of the conversation all together.  otherwise, the retrospect on walter brennen was wonderfully done. they made no bones about it ... it was grandpa who made the show such a success. i remember, as a child, mimicking grandpa's gimp walk and my parents laughing (as i'm sure a million other children did back then). one annoyance that did bother me a bit, was the tendency for richard crenna to dominate the discussion ... at times interrupting tony and kathleen to make a point. in fact, although tony martinez seemed completely capable to contribute to the conversation, he was not allowed to speak-out and say too much during the reunion show. unfortunate, since i wanted to hear from all three, equally. all in all, the reunion show was a real treat for me. i've watched it on dvd several times and have enjoyed it each time.  dodgerdude",1
"i have not seen this movie in ages but figured i'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. the original the getaway was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) a sam peckinpah movie, 2) featured steve mcqueen, ben johnson, and slim pickens, 3) was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.  by comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot alec baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, kim basinger. mcqueen and his then wife allie mcbride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.  let's just get it said and out of the way -- alec baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the cooler king, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of steve mcqueen in the lead role. like someone else points out, peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. by contrast baldwin, bassinger & company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only michael madsen's and james woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.  the movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. one viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. there's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.  so i don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. i'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie & fall flat with something original. this movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release mr. baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in hollywood. thank god for ""team america"" for putting him in his place.  3/10",0
"the biggest surprise in this movie was the performance of daryl hannah. rather than playing the stereotypical ditzy blonde roles that she usually does she plays a street-smart, intelligent, world-weary character. she doesn't have a huge role but she does a great job portraying lois harlan as a woman tired of, although used to, covering up for her boss' indiscretions.",1
"i was 16 when i first saw the movie, and it has always been a huge favorite of mine. of course, you can't deny the appeal of kristofferson in the movie - how fine is that man???????????? sheesh. he still is. he's the bad boy every woman secretly wants. his acting is flawless. he played a drunk/druggie only the way someone who really had gone through it could - and he had - in '76 he finally got on the wagon, so it was all very real.  the music is great and even though in later years i thought streisand was somewhat not the right person for him in a physical beauty sense, i think it's more a problem for male viewers than female. us gals are just looking at kris - and naturally the guys are looking at the female interest - my husband cannot watch the movie b/c of her - he doesn't like her looks. but i did make him sit through just the red ferrari scene on the road towards the end just so he could see how well done it was - the camera work was so perfect and you were totally in the car with him with the music blasting - you should have seen it on my 50"" plasma - wow!!!! and lastly, the transfer quality was great - anamorphic widescreen and really clear with great color and very low noise except for dark areas which is normal for all film.  brought back some great memories of my mom and i loving this movie together, i bought a copy for her for christmas. would have loved to watch it together with her last night.  i have tried to sit through the original with judy garland, but i guess seeing this one first, i just can't get into the earlier era. watching all the concert footage in the '76 version was so much like what i was living at the time.  i am working my way through the commentary by streisand, but she seems to only talk about herself and the songs, so far she has barely even mentioned kris or details about scenes in the movie. her voice sounds exactly the same now as then.  check it out, if you grew up in the same era as me (born in 1960) you will love it.  wendy",1
"red rock west is a perfect example of how good a film can be with practically no budget. all you need is a smart script, good actors and loads of atmosphere. rrw delivers all these and more.  nic cage plays an ex-marine, injured in lebanon, who is down to his last 5 dollars after being refused a job on an oilfield because of his bad knee. he roles into red rock and is mistaken by bartender wayne (jt walsh, not quite as his most menacing-but still evil) for a hit-man from texas.  he pays him to kill his wife and make it look like burglary. only when he gets there, just to check her out. she offers him double to kill wayne. cage just wants to get the hell out of town with his free money and leave the sparring lovers be. but a series of mishaps and setbacks results in him yo-yoing in and out of red rock, back and forth. eventually this leads to a run-in with lyle from dallas (a cheeky and somehow sympathetic dennis hopper), the real hit-man from texas who offers to help without knowing he's making the plot more complicated.  rrw never had a big release, thus most of it's audience discovered it on video or on cable tv showings. viewing it in such a way might make it seem like a tv movie but it's bigger than that. the slick, slowly-timed direction, moody score and howling desert wind would have all made for a great movie in theatres but the best you can do these days is watch the dvd on a big hdtv.  the only weak point of the movie i can think of is lara flynn boyle's boring femme fatale with the nasty dyke-ish hairdo. i certainly wouldn't fall for her but if you assume that nic cage's character is in to militant lesbians then you'll accept it nonetheless.",1
"the young lady's name is bonnie (polay). she's attractive, is apparently living a pretty decent life, but all of a sudden is inexplicably snatched from her home and life by evil dude and the various and sundry evil henchmen. now she has no idea what the hell is going on, only that a bunch of armed-to-the-teeth people apparently want her dead...and she's going to die not even knowing why.  god, i hear the whining all the time. now that content is so cheap to produce and people can create their own movies/books/comics/internal organs, there's going to be nobody to ensure that there's a standard of quality! we're going to be drowning in crap! the only people who actually think this are people who haven't watched any movies or read any books recently-- because we're already doing a dead man's float in crap. it's folks like ferrari and rodriguez who put the lie to these ignorant so-and-sos by throwing $8k on the table and making...well, what i would say is a better action flick than anything you've seen in cinemas this year...but you haven't seen any action flicks in the cinema this year. i've seen the box office. you're staying away in droves. you would do better to snag a copy of this, spend twenty minutes being entertained, and get on with your lives.  it's sheer entertainment. you enter, like bonnie, with a lot of questions and where the whole thing ends up is nebulous. the whole conceit has been done before in multiple ways but not in such a compressed amount of time and not without such concentrated tasty gunplay. you're there for the atmosphere, the mystery, and the guns. that's it--that's all the filmmakers promise, and they deliver.  it warms the black pits of my heart to think this was made on such a budget. we get passed a goodly number of indie films around here, but seldom do we see anything as polished as this short is, and we've never seen one done in the action genre that looked this good. hell, you could hand these two guys mi: 3 and it might draw me into watch it. the bond franchise. hell, anything. no, in fact, better yet: i'd like to see these guys make a feature on their own and stay the hell away from hollywood. whatever's out there killing the movie industry is no doubt infectious.  best indie we've seen in a while and the most effective indie calling card we've ever seen. the dvd's $20 and has bonus features out the ass. go take your movie ticket budget and put it towards this instead.",1
"a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away.....there was a boy who was only two years old when the original ""star wars"" film was released. he doesn't remember first seeing the movie, but he also doesn't remember life before it. he does remember the first ""star wars"" themed gift he got...a shoebox full of action figures from the original set. he was too young to fully appreciate how special that gift would be. but years later, he would get what to this day goes down as one of the best gifts he's ever received: another box full of action figures, ten of the final twelve he needed to complete his collection. it's now legendary in this boy's family how the last action figure he needed, anakin skywalker, stopped being produced and carried in stores, and how this boy went for about ten years (until he got into college) trying to track one down and finally bought it from someone on his dorm floor for a bag of beer nuggets (don't ask...it's a northern illinois university thing).  i can't review ""star wars"" as a movie. it represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. there's no separating it in my mind from christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. in the winter, my friends and i would build snow forts and pretend we were on hoth (i was always han solo). my friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the ewok village. they also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in yoda's home. i am unabashedly dorky when it comes to ""star wars"" and i think people either just understand that or they don't. i don't get the appeal of ""lord of the rings"" or ""star trek"" but i understand the rabid flocks of fans that follow them because i am a rabid fan of george lucas's films.  i feel no need to defend my opinion of these movies as some of the greatest of all time. every time i put them in the dvd player, i feel like i'm eight years old again, when life was simple and the biggest problem i had was figuring out how i was going to track down a figure of anakin skywalker.  grade (for the entire trilogy): a+",1
"one of the most provocative films ever with excellent cinematography backed up by mc clarens lisp and stunning quote ""do you believe in love at first site?"".  a trace of expressionism was evident in this picture, further catapulting the films flawless integrity. gabby (aka joey) played by eva longoria clearly loved the movie and role she played so much that she couldn't even be bothered giving it mention in her filmography. lol.  the best part of the movie would have to be without a doubt, the heroic rescue by mc clure as he saved the young 'handicapped' kid with the speech impediment.. which i may add was acted to perfection! james cahiil's use of sound effects is unmatched even to this day. the drug bust he performs early in the film is pain stakingly realistic. when i watched this movie for the first time i was so compelled with the intense lack of respect for the gang inthused brothers from the southside gang and the ctm (cut throat mafia). this was by far one of the most encapsulating crevice cahill has committed to filming.  personally this film holds sentimental value to me and i will be downloading it in the near future. thats if i can find it anywhere, lol!",1

"**spoilers** i rented ""tesis"" (or ""thesis"" in english) on the strength of director alejandro amenabar's later effort ""the others"". based on what a brilliantly measured and horrifyingly effective creepfest that film was, i assumed his earlier efforts would be of a similar quality and i was in the mood for some good horror. instead i wound up with the most tedious, preposterous excuse for a lame-brained slasher movie i've seen since the german film ""anatomie"" (which this one kinda reminded me of).  the plot has potential but it's thrown away within the first 20 minutes. it revolves around innocent-n-pretty psychology student angela's (ana torrent - a jessica harper deadringer) thesis on the subject of violence in films. through some far-fetched circumstances too dumb to go into here, she winds up in possession of a 'snuff' tape on which two men torture, mutilate and kill a young girl for the camera. angela, and her horror-buff friend chema (fele martinez) are both shocked yet intrigued by the tape and decide to get to the bottom of who's responsible for it.  this leads to... well, nothing.  they never really give a reason for why they want to find the girl's killers (since they resolutely refuse to contact the police throughout any of the unfolding events, even when their own lives at risk) and the mystery itself is as limp as graham norton in a room full of bunny girls. there is only one proper 'clue' (the type of camera the killers used is discovered) and that's a) a really weak one and b) wheeled out in the first 20 minutes. the rest of the so-called 'unravelling' just occurs through blind luck, increasingly ridiculous plot twists and a slew of awful, transparent and thoroughly pointless red herrings that are chucked in merely to pad out the running time.  seriously - amenabar might know his stuff about ghost stories but he's clearly never read a detective book in his life. the key to a good whodunnit is to have a large cluster of potential suspects and to eliminate them one by one with clever deduction and the gradual discovery of more and more evidence, before moving in for the final twist. in ""tesis"", *potential spoiler ahead* the killer's identity is guessed correctly by the amateur 'detectives' almost instantly and then we get 100 minutes of the writer trying feebly to throw us off the scent until he runs out of ideas, throws his hands up and says ""ok, ya got me, it was him after all""! as for any kind of logic or motive behind the crimes - no such luck. you're watching the wrong movie if that's what you're after.  the only thing that drags ""tesis"" down further from just being a dumb, badly written thriller is the way it actually tries to make some ludicrous, muddled-up 'point' about violence in films. i have no idea what stance it's attempting to take on the subject but it seems determined to cram in a ton of misguided, confused psychobabble, in between the rest of the gibberish, and say ""look at me! i'm political!"". the final scenes, in which the ""point"" of the movie is supposedly hammered home, are so utterly absurd and puerile, one can't help but wonder if amenabar feels embarrassed now when he watches this. if he doesn't, he certainly should. this is total 'amateur night at the slasher house' stuff.  overall i can't believe i wasted two whole hours (it felt like at least six) on this, just hoping something might happen. the urban legend of 'snuff films' (and that is basically all they are, despite the way this film tries to suggest they're some kind of criminal phenomenon sweeping the world!) is an area that can be so tantalisingly exploited in good horror films (""videodrome"" anyone?) but it's so easy to step over the line into childlike 'wouldn't it be cool if!' territory with it (ie: ""my little eye"")... ""tesis"" hits an all-time low for the 'snuff movie' genre. on every level, this one is better left dead and buried. i'll award it a 1 out of 10, for some nice lighting, but that's all it's getting.",0
"prom night is shot with the artistic eye someone gives while finely crafting a lifetime original film. you know the one. this october, lifetime takes a break from the courageous tale of a woman surviving (insert disease name here) to tell the somewhat creepy tale of a woman pursued by a stalker ex-boyfriend. it's dramatic  it's sappy  it's immensely dull. it does nothing to further a genre, tell an original story, or strive for any sort of newness. prom night shares this plight. watching the killer poke holes in his victims, we sit silently as they slump to the floor with not a drop of blood spilled. it occurred to me that this was the cleanest killer in movie history.  our director is working with a fairly good-looking killer so he is forced to pour on the camera angles to make him appear creepier. think about matthew mcconaughey coming at you with a knife. you'd probably go  ""oh! good lookin guy is going to kill me? naaaa."" not scary even for a second, so the director throws schaech into shadows and over the shoulder in the mirror. this mirror shot is repeated to the point of sickness as it practically becomes a fetish of the creator. you'll get 15 jump scares in this film, 2 of which made my date jump (i might mention she is afraid of everything). i'd also mention she decided to take a nap halfway through the film and at one point threatened to leave me.  as if this film were not disjointed enough, it appears to be cut to shreds. i'm not saying it looks like key points were left on the cutting room floor as the crew scrambled to salvage some semblance of a horror film; i'm saying as the film moves from scene to scene, you often get a jarring jump. this is the kind of thing you'd expect when a film catches fire and a projectionist is forced to splice ends together, cross his fingers, and hope for the best. the editor should be shot.  with a plot you can pack into two sentences, one stray spray of blood, an emo killer, and the tension of a very special episode of ""silver spoons"", we're left with no reason to support horror this weekend  at least on the big screen. in fact, this is the sort of film that should be punished. is it really that hard to make a scary movie? was this crew even aware they were making a horror film??!! a complete waste of my time and yours. i bit the bullet to get you this review. don't let my sacrifice be in vain. don't go into the movie!!!",0
"wow, i can't believe people consider this a 'good' movie. now, i have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic/funny comedies with john cusack.  this is a mediocre film at best. while the acting wasn't terrible, but not great, for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. there were many loose ends that don't show up or are not addressed. unfortunately, the main characters do come off as complete cowards. they don't know themselves well enough to realize that they don't love the people they are engaged to. how do we know they aren't in love? by the utter lack of remorse both characters have for leaving their finances. i can think of few things more romantic than the continual escape from commitment that these two show.  the movie doesn't even end with a wedding scene, more than likely both will get cold feet and drop each other like hot potatoes once a commitment is nearing. this movie is really about two people who can't commit to anything, unlike cusack's previous characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (loyd in say anything, martin in grosse pointe blank, etc.).  the greatest failure of this movie was the complete lack of any twists turns, or anything of interest. when the movie ended, i felt like they had failed to include a climax to the story, which basically fits the whole movie: boring. no suspense about whether the two will end up together, no joy when they do, no consequences to their actions.  it is sad that people are so blind to the shoddiness of this movie, that they simply rebuke any criticism with 'everyone is too cynical!'. criticism of this movie is not cynicism, simply unbiased examination. there are many other better romantic comedies, even ones with grace kelly, or eva marie saint.  if you think this movie is great, try these movies, you hearts will explode: the princess bride, say anything, grosse pointe blank, high fidelity, keeping the faith, charade, rear window, north by northwest, or there's something about mary (which is a good examination of idealized romance vs. today's society).",0
"bo is jane parker, whose long-lost anthropologist father (richard harris, in the worst role of a very inconsistent career) is in africa studying something or another. she tracks him down (how?) and he tells her of the natives' stories of a giant monster whose nightly howling can be heard throughout the jungle. turns out to be the ape man himself (miles o'keeffe, who has the film's best dialogue), who rescues her from bad guys and falls in love with her, leaving them just enough time in this agonizing two hours to romp naked while a horny monkey looks on and cheers. normally i'm very open-minded to varying opinions about any film, but this is the sole exception. this is the worst film ever made. if you don't agree, you haven't seen it.

"from reading all of the comments posted here on imdb, this movie seems to get ragged on a lot, but i didn't think it was that bad. i've seen much worse, actually.  ""the house where evil dwells"" is a ghost story about a husband and his wife, ted and laura fletcher, and their daughter, amy, who move into an old house in japan. little do they know, a japanese ninja brutally murdered his wife and her lover, and then killed himself 100 years earlier with a samurai sword. as strange things happen in the house, the ghosts of the previous residents begin to possess the bodies of the living, and plan on re-enacting the bloody murder that took place 100 years back.  i saw this movie and decided to give it a chance, from the cover it looked like a decent ghost story. it was routine, and it was corny, but i've seen worse in my day. the ghost sequences were a little over-done, we get to see the translucent blue-tinted figures randomly pop up randomly around the family, and take over their bodies. to be honest, the ghosts in this movie kind of reminded me of the ghosts in the haunted mansion ride at disneyland. i may be mistaken, but after watching this, it seemed to me that the japanese horror film ""ju-on: the grudge"" and the american remake of that film ripped this off a little. the old japanese home where a brutal murder took place, ghostly activity, curses put on the home, etc. but i may be wrong.  to sum it up, this is a pretty corny ghost story. don't go out of your way to see it, but if you like this kind of thing and it happens to come on tv you can give it a shot. 4/10.",0
"shown in australia as 'hydrosphere', this incredibly bad movie is so bad that you become hypnotised and have to watch it to the end, just to see if it could get any worse... and it does! the storyline is so predictable it seems written by a high school dramatics class, the sets are pathetic but marginally better than the miniatures, and the acting is wooden.  the infant 'muppet' seems to have been stolen from the props cupboard of 'total recall'. there didn't seem to be a single, original idea in the whole movie.  i found this movie to be so bad that i laughed most of the way through.  malcolm mcdowell should hang his head in shame. he obviously needed the money!",0
"- a small time hood tricks the local mob boss out of a lot of money. of course the mob boss wants his money back and doesn't care who he has to kill to get it. the punk enlists his friend and an old mobster to help him save his life.  - if this sounds ridiculous, it is. the whole idea that this izod-wearing, dune buggy-driving punk could hold off one of the most powerful mobs in rome is just plain silly. his friend may be good with a gun, but he's up against a group of trained killers. the old mobster is little more than comic relief and no real help when it comes to the face off with the mob. there's also a sub-plot about how the friend's father was killed years ago by the mob boss, but there's little made of it and it doesn't help the movie any at all.  - the mob boss, mister scarface, is played by jack palance. i suppose he got the name because he has what looks like a shaving nick on his cheek. palance is as ineffective as the rest of the cast, doing what he must to get a paycheck.  - i've seen some pretty good italian crime/cop flicks recently, but mister scarface isn't one of them. check out syndicate sadists or revolver instead.",0

"everyone knows about this ''zero day'' event. what i think this movie did that elephant did not is that they made us see how these guys were. they showed their life for about a year. throughout the movie we get to like them, to laugh with them even though we totally know what they're gonna do. and that gives me the chills. cause i felt guilty to be cheered by their comments, and i just thought cal was a sweet guy. even though i knew what was gonna happen you know? even at the end of the movie when they were about to commit suicide and just deciding if they did it on the count of 3 or 4 i thought this was funny but still i was horrified to see their heads blown off. of course i was. i got to like them. they were wicked, maybe, but i felt like they were really normal guys, that they didn't really realize it. but i knew they were.  that's, imo, the main force of this movie. it makes us realize that our friends, or relatives, or anyone, can be planning something crazy, and that we won't even notice it. this movie, as good as it was, made me feel bad. and that's why i can't go to sleep right now. there's still this little feeling in my stomach. butterflies.",1
"even steve martin and dan aykroyd couldn't save this movie from laying an emu-sized egg. based on the classic phil silvers tv series, it bombed because: a) it was updated to the 1990s, and b) the simple premise of the tv series was turned into a confusing, feeble and silly screenplay.  the original tv series used a small cast of talented actors to portray lovable characters acting out simple yet hilarious pranks. to expand this premise into a 1990s movie was asking for trouble, and it shows. no one could pay me enough to sit through this stinker a second time.",0

"this is an excellent example of what can be done on a small budget movie. the acting is excellent considering the script & the whole atmosphere of the film is very foreboding. the gore is well done and used sparingly (look out for the excellent barbed-wire death) & the action is punchy when used. it's true that there are dodgy lines in the script at times, but compared to other movies on the same (or bigger!) budget, it's hardly noticeable at all. overall, this is recommended. trust me, it's better than it appears! 8/10",1

"i stumbled onto this movie when i was ebay'ing caesars palace stuff, as i'm enamoured with its rich vegas history as the last of the original luxury resorts still standing in good condition (unless you count bally's, the original mgm grand). in that respect, this movie delivers full-force. you're given a grand tour of the caesars property,which in spite of all the renovations and additions they've done over the 40 years it's been open, looks alarmingly similar. as a film overall, the plot is somewhat difficult to follow, thanks in large part to the horrendous editing. and when i say horrendous, i'm not using that word lightly. there's a lot of spliced-in, second-long snippets of vegas traffic, casino crowds, and even a scene where the robert drivas character is having a conversation with his father about how much he's grown up, and without any explanation, he (drivas) goes (in those infamous snippets) from being himself, to a baby, to a little boy, and then back to himself while talking back and forth with his father. (that doesn't give away any plot details; if anything, one can be prepared for it and maybe they won't be as flabbergasted as i was by the editing.) the film has aged well otherwise, and has a good message about the inherent differences between a father and his son that most guys could relate to in some form or fashion.",1
"this film is quite simply one of the worst films ever made and is a damning indictment on not only the british film industry but the talentless hacks at work today. not only did the film get mainstream distribution it also features a good cast of british actors, so what went wrong? i don't know and simply i don't care enough to engage with the debate because the film was so terrible it deserves no thought at all. be warned and stay the hell away from this rubbish. but apparently i need to write ten lines of text in this review so i might as well detail the plot. a nob of a man is setup by his evil friend and co-worker out of his father's company and thus leads to an encounter with the russian mafia and dodgy accents and stupid, very stupid plot twists/devices. i should have asked for my money back but was perhaps still in shock from the experience. if you want a good crime film watch the usual suspects or the godfather, what about lock, stock.... thats the peak of the contemporary british crime film.....",0
"the film ""52 pick up"" simply does not work. see it if you are at all interested in elmore leonard or john frankenheimer, or anyone in the terrific cast, especially john glover who's admittedly brilliant. but the book--a slow-burning, noir thriller with lots of pulp--should have translated into an oscar-contending film instead of this dud that couldn't figure out whether it should faithfully portray the hard-boiled, gritty crime story of the book, or opt for a 1980s schwarzenegger shoot-em-up spree. shifting the scene from the original locale in the book, detroit (an area where leonard has resided for years and knows very well), to los angeles makes for a substantial problem that leonard tries to fix in his script, but ultimately can't. it was, for example, a clever device making mitchell's wife a city councilwoman (she had no job in the book), if you think about it: that's the only way you could ever plausibly blackmail someone in a sex-crazed city like 1980s los angeles for adultery, or any type of potential sex scandal. even then, it's more plausible in a more conservative eastern state like michigan to believe that a) its tiny porno ""industry"" is a sleazy, money-grubbing hell where three losers could desperately set up a not-so-stupid upper-middle-class fellow going through a mid-life crisis, and b) adultery alone might be something you could blackmail someone with, if their upstanding careers and old-fashioned wives couldn't handle the shock. as consultant ron jeremy will tell you, 1980s los angeles was a colorful, stylish porno mecca, more like the movie ""boogie nights"" than leonard's dark, shadowy world of hijacked tourist buses, grimy apartments, and drug deals in depressed urban squalor. then again, los angeles could be the backdrop of such a tale if one arranged the scenery more carefully--there are still plenty of dark crannies and psychopaths there. unfortunately, roy scheider's harry mitchell comes off in the film as a sexy, handsome uebermensch dancing through his problems without even working up a sweat. in the book he was fending off a jerk union official while struggling with a business that was failing. he also had a skeleton in the closet during the war involving friendly fire that he was responsible for, but never appeared to come to grips with. elmore leonard's stories usually have a central image involving a bizarre civility between criminal and law-abiding citizen. here, harry mitchell sitting in his office with his blackmailer, alan raimy, turning over his financial books to him and negotiating a more practical ransom, makes for such a central image. glover's blackmailer plays the scene with convincing intelligence, but scheider portrays the victim here as a cocky ""good guy,"" in charge of the situation as if he were more a rambo with an m-16 than the everyman barely staying afloat as his world crumbles around him. ""52 pick up"" ends with one of the worst throwaway conclusions ever, considering all the thought that went into the original story and then the film. trapping raimy inside mitchell's jaguar and blowing him up with marching band music blasting out along with a sadistic monologue by mitchell, plays to an audience wanting the ""sweet revenge"" conclusion of a chuck norris movie, not the intelligent balanced world of leonard's book, where mitchell barely escapes in the end and the conflict between good and evil could easily go either way. i left the theater shaking my head and depressed. what a waste of talent.",0

"yesterday, i went to the monthly antique flea market that comes to town. i really have no interest in such things, but i went for the fellowship of friends who do have such an interest. looking over the hundreds of vendor, passing many of them quickly, i spotted someone selling vhs tapes and dvds. most of the films he had on dvd were rather recent; the oldest one i noticed was the 1940 cary grant-irene dunne co-starrer my favorite wife. but the vhs tapes, by their nature, were mostly older films. i couldn't resist buying something since they were being sold at 3 tapes for $10.00. what a bargain, as eddie murphy used to say. i came across one film that i had heard about for years but had never seen: john cassavettes's opening night (1977). well, i certainly wanted that being a fan of gena rowlands, and i had heard that this film contained one of her finest performances. he also had faces (1968). i had seen this about 20 years ago, a time when i probably had not had enough life experience to appreciate it thoroughly. and i wanted to take advantage of the bargain, so i grabbed that one too. my other choice was claire's knee (1970).   when i got home, i decided to put aside the work i had planned to do so that i could watch opening night. i was totally enthralled by this film. it focuses on myrtle gordon (gena rowlands), a famous actress of stage and screen, who, during out-of-town previews, is having personal and professional problems coming to terms with both her character and the play's theme of facing aging. after one rehearsal, an avid fan and autograph hound accosts her with cries (and tears) of ""i love you! i love you!"" a few minutes later, this fan is hit by a car and killed. this begins myrtle's descent into herself where she must face her own fears of aging, the future of her career as a mature actress, and the inadequacies she finds in the play itself (written by a much older female dramatist, played by joan blondell). throughout the film, she sees the dead girl, an obvious symbol of her past; drinks almost constantly; and receives insincere support from her director (ben gazzara), the producer (paul stewart), her costar (john cassavettes himself), and the dramatist. actually, they're more concerned about how her behavior will affect them and their careers: flubbing lines on stage, improvising new lines, generally cracking up on stage, and arriving for the broadway opening totally drunk.   this story functions not only to address the issues of aging but also to promote cassavettes's displeasure with mainstream movie-making. as i watched the film, i was at times surprised, confused, amused, disparaging, but ultimately involved, entertained, and satisfied. cassavettes really had a great sense of humor, cared very much that his audience understood what he was implying, and wanted them to be emotionally involved in the story. he makes allusions to all about eve with the use of the avid theater fan, even dressing the young girl in a slicker and hat similar to the one worn by anne baxter at the beginning of that film. this allusion functions most obviously to support his aging theme, the contrast of the older and younger woman. he also obviously uses the contrast as a symbol for myrtle's confronting her own lost youth. at first, i felt the symbolism was too obvious, but then i realized that that was cassavettes's intention. he doesn't want his audience misunderstanding what he's getting at; if they did, it would interfere with their emotional involvement. this spectre of youth haunts myrtle, attacks her, and wants to destroy her. myrtle eventually ""kills"" her, but before she can really come to terms with herself and the play, she must reach bottom (another figurative death?). so cassavettes has her get so drunk that she can't walk and must crawl to her dressing room the night the play opens on broadway. she resurrects herself (helping yourself out of such situations is also important to the film's theme) and makes the play a success by giving a great performance and changing the direction of play for the better by improvising so that it contains some ray of hope for the aging character she's playing. these scenes are funny and interesting. cassavettes and rowlands actually did the play in front of live audiences, who did and did not know they were going to be part of a movie. the play they're doing also acts as contrast: it's mainstream and self-serious about the issues it addresses, that is, until myrtle changes its denouement. in doing so, she also improves the work of her co-stars. the natural evolution of interaction (achieved through improvisation)between and among human beings, subjective realism, and universal truth - these were cassavettes's concerns in making films.   gena rowlands is amazing throughout. of course, she has that great face, and cassavettes (notoriously in love with her throughout their marriage) treats us to numerous closeups of it so that we too can feel her emotions and that we know what's going on inside of her. she makes you care so much about this character that you want to see her work her way out of this crisis of the soul. and this is what holds your attention for the 2 hours and 30 minutes running time. the film is deliberately paced at times and requires constant attention, but anyone with interest in good film-making and great acting will be rewarded. someone else said that this is a movie for people who love movies. all others be forewarned.   seek out opening night if you've never seen it. everyone in it is excellent, and it's one of cassavettes's best films.",1

"the anime that got me hooked on anime...  set in the year 2010 (hey, that's not too far away now!) the earth is now poison gas wasteland of pollution and violence. seeing as how crimes are happening ever 30 seconds are so and committed by thieves who have the fire power of third world terrorists, the government of the fictional new port city form the tank police to deal with the problem - cops with tanks! oh the insanity!  the ""heroes"" of this series include the new recruit leona ozaki, a red haired japanese woman (yeah i know, they never match their distinctly japanese names with a japanese appearance) who has just been drafted into the tank police and is quickly partnered with blond, blue eyed nice guy al. leona is new at using tanks and unfortunately she destroys the favorite tank of tank police commander charles britain (also known as ""brenten""), a big guy who looks like tom selleck on steroids and sporting a pair of nifty sunglasses, a big revolver and a bad temper. britain didn't like having leona join the tank police in the first place and her wrecking his tiger special (a giant green monster tank) doesn't exactly endear her to him, nor is he fond of her taking the remains of his giant tank and using it to build a mini-tank that she nicknames bonaparte and he is soon pushing to have her transferred to child welfare ""where the boys are more your size"" as he puts it. there's also specs, the bifocal genius, bible quoting/god fearing chaplain, purple mo-hawked mohican, and the pot bellied chief, who's right on the edge thanks to the mayor always yelling at him about the tank police antics. seeing as how the tank cops often destroy half the city while chasing the bad guys and use extreme violence to capture them, they're not very well liked by the people.  the ""villains"" are a cyborg named buaku who's got a mysterious past that's connected with a project known as ""green peace"", his gang and his two sexy cat cyborg sidekicks anna & uni puma. in the first installment these guys are being paid to steal urine samples from a hospital treating people who haven't been infected by the poison gas clouds and in the 2nd they're hired to steal a painting that is of a naked buaku. the story, however, was uncompleted in the anime and was finished up in a cult comic (""manga"") book that's very hard to find.  all sorts of chaos and mayhem ensue in this black comic venture that examines how far people want their police to go in order to catch criminals and what happens when the fine line between good guys and bad guys starts to get blurred. this is the kind of thing that if you were going to make a movie of it, you'd better go get quentin tarantino. uneven in places but still a lot of fun.  followed by ""new dominion: tank police"".",1

"the night evelyn came out of the grave (emilio miraglia - italy 1971).  i only watched this delirious piece of euro-tosh in the way of alpha video's dreadful dvd-release (looks like an extremely bad video-transfer), but from what i saw, not nearly interesting enough to purchase no shame's recent dvd-release. considering their excellent track record, it will undoubtedly be a major improvement over all previous releases. and don't pay attention to the ridiculous cover shown here, it's not taken from this film (some girl holding the head of a jim carrey look-a-like).  spaghetti western star anthony steffen sports a hip hairdo and assumes the role of lord alan cunningham, a man haunted by the memory of his dead wife evelyn. this leads to a nervous breakdown which has him being retained in a psychiatric clinic. once released, cunningham channels this trauma by taking redheaded prostitutes to his countryside castle, subjecting them to vicious acts of torture. his doctor and friend, richard timberlane (what do you mean, italian horror names sound ""made up?""), advises him to forget the past and remarry but cunningham is obsessed with evelyn and even organizes a séance at the castle. eventually, after killing some more girls, he meets gladys, another redhead, and marries her almost immediately, but the arrival of his new wife spawns a series of sinister events. bloodthirsty creatures strike at sir alan's family, killing them off one by one. becoming more distraught, cunningham visits evelyn's tomb and discovers it to be empty. soon, a number of ""outsiders"" begin to suspect something fishy is going on in the castle and lord cunningham's treatment might not have been that successful after all.  director emilio miraglia tries to blend gothic horror with giallo conventions with limited success. as usual, not the slightest effort was made to convince audiences the film is set in england. the cars drive on the right side of the road, everyone looks very mediterranean and the castle (and the rest of the architecture) is patently italian. this is common practice in italian horror, but sometimes they just take this a little too far. the bad print made this even slightly bearable, since it's so dark, you couldn't see much of the surroundings anyway. but, then again, this is the kind of film where anything can happen in the name of exploitation and depicting reality isn't really the issue. a large part consists of sado-masochistic torture scenes in the castle torture chamber, but most of the time, anthony steffen hams his way through this and shows some horrible over-acting. i guess it all depends on your state of mind and this can be a fun piece of nonsense if you're in the right mood. i just couldn't take it, at least not with the print i watched. a pleasant score though by bruno nicolai which combines easy-listening tunes with some psychedelic rock numbers.  camera obscura --- 4/10",0
"i wanted to give drawing blood the benefit of the initial doubt. the opening moments, with a naked woman sprawled out and an painter, diana, about to paint her and then sucking her blood to drain out so she can use it for her art, give the impression that this could be a kick-ass artsy-vampire flick. turns out this initial impression turns out false. oh, troma, the mark of some kind of lack of quality: sometimes they'll offer up something that is trash but funny and with at least some competence to the junk-food craft (or, sometimes not). this is a case where it's not even a whole lot of fun to watch since its attempts at humor (i.e. the protagonist's father is an old vaudevillian who does jimmy durante impressions?) are weak at best, and any unintentional laughs are undercut by sergio lapel's bargain basement direction.  and it's not without him trying, oh lord no. he does try a lot, which is a big part of the problem. he and his producers had money for lights, sure, but the way they're used in the movie made i, a former student filmmaker and aspiring director, sulking in my seat: if i saw this in a theater i would have to blind my eyes in many instances, and would wonder whether or not his dp understood really the basic 3-point lighting set-up. while this, along with a very lackluster sound design (or just lots of random loud humming like in the art gallery scene), shouldn't be something that comes to attention during a troma release, it should be something *basic* that a filmmaker can tackle even if the script isn't very funny or scary (and it isn't) or if lapel does a weird mixture of songs placed at bizarre moments.  it's not a good movie by any stretch, and perhaps if you're a vampire die-hard (or just a vampire period) it might have some appeal as a low-rent bargain basement alternative to near dark, or as a slight improvement over, say, 1972's blood freak. you have better ways to waste your time, overall.",0

"this film is so bad and gets worse in every imaginable fashion. its not just the poor acting and script nor is it the lame and perverse time one wastes on watching it. what really puts this film in my hall of shame is the apparent struggling that the writers and producers do with the film to try and make it funny. the actress replacing jean reno's descendant is to old and learned her lesson in the first film so they add a new girl who is to be married. nearly all of the original extras and gags return however this time makes me want to ripe my eyes out of my sockets because it's a waste of perfectly good film. the torture of the constant camera cuts and shots in any scene in this movie can put the viewer into violent convolutions. this second film takes the successful original and drags it out of its coffin and parades the corpse out in the public square and perversely degrades not only the original idea and its legacy but our intelligence as well. this film unlike the spruce goose could not fly for it had no plot in the principals returning for a 'necklace'. no script since it was apparently written and added to daily. no attention to camera or shots in mind. poor lighting and special effects done for the sake of doing so. this film would not even pass for a student film in basic film 101. how this pile got through no one can tell. it was a big loosing investment and it appears that no one had the strength to put this unnatural cruel mistake out of our miseries. this movie has one good part ...its end! this film is my #1 worst film of all time, finally ""howard the duck"" is no longer the goose.",0

"a huge hit upon release with australian audiences, it can still be funny today, but its over-the-top political incorrectness and blunt, unsubtle humour can make it a bit of a cringer. it goes on far too long; some of   the content could have been saved for the sequel, barry mckenzie holds his own, which desperately needed some new stuff anyway. granted, his ocker aussie attitude is funny, but also becomes annoying as the film drags on. some say crocker's songs are the best bits, and they are certainly original, but ""hilarious""? the adventures of barry mckenzie will go down as a landmark in australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to make sure that overseas audiences do not see the majority of australians as barry mckenzies (or, for that matter, mick dundees!). rating: 5/10",0
"my teacher taped this and showed it to us in child care to demonstrate how teen pregnancy affects people. it just demonstrated how teen pregnancy affects a childish jock not properly educated on how sex works and a whiny, unloved girl who throws fruit when angry and couldn't tell she was with the wrong man even if he wore a sign stating he was such. i wouldn't be surprised if the father of the baby had about eight girlfriends in the first edition of the script. stacy's (the carrier of the baby) mother is a riot. she is oblivious to the fact her daughter is past the age of four and is seemingly unshaken when people spy on her through her dining room window. bobby's (the father) best friend's name is dewey, and is an obvious rip off of sean penn's character in fast times at ridgemont high. this movie is horrid, simply because none of the characters are believable. thank goodness it's only made for tv, limiting the public's chances of viewing it.",0
"the original vampires (1998) is one of my favorites. i was curious to see how a sequel would work considering they used none of the original characters. i was quite surprised at how this played out. as a rule, sequels are never as good as the original, with a few exceptions. though this one was not a great movie, the writer did well in keeping the main themes & vampire lore from the first one in tact. jon bon jovi was a drawback initially, but he proved to be a half-way decent slayer. i doubt anyone could top james wood's performance in the first one, though... unless you bring in buffy!  all in all, this was a decent watch & i would watch it again.  i was left with two questions, though... what happened to jack crow & how did derek bliss come to be a slayer? guess we'll just have to leave that to imagination.",1
"jochen hick wrote and directed this little thriller of a suspense film based on the concept that the aids virus was a sheep virus mutated by the government to rid the world of gays and was apparently tested on convicts in the years before the outbreak of the hideous disease. were it not for the poignancy of the concept of the film, this would fall into the category of the many films about the ruination of the world by a rampant non-prejudicial infective organism.  stefan (tom wlaschiha) journeys from berlin to san francisco to investigate his father's scientific suppositions about the induced sheep virus and its effects of the convicts in whom it was infused. he meets with some disdain and resistance to a dead theory, but also encounters some folks who know of the theory and support his investigation. simultaneously with his visit a series of serial murders takes place, each victim killed in a similar manner and each murder apparently accompanied by strains of music from puccini's opera 'turandot' which just happens to be opening at the san francisco opera. a police investigator louise tolliver (irit levi) and her companion cop (kalene parker) follow the murders while stefan makes the rounds of the sex clubs and bars in san francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory. he encounters a strange lad jeffrey (jim thalman) with whom he has a cat and mouse attraction and a prominent doctor burroughs (richard conti) who seems oddly involved in the cast of suspects. how this all come to an end is the play of the film, a story as much about the search for self identity between stefan and jeffery as it is a case for investigation of murders.  while tom wlaschiha, jim thalman and richard conti do well with their roles (they are the only three who have any prior acting experience in the film!), the quality of the film sags considerably by the less than acceptable minimally talented irit levy and kaylene parker: when on screen the credibility of the story drops below zero. there are some small cameos by other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but in all the film is drowned by the incessant replay of 'nessun dorma' as sung by mario del monaco from a recording o the opera - and that seems to be the reason for making the film! good idea for a film and some good characterizations by the actors, but there is no resolution of the initial premise that started the whole thing. grady harp, february 06",0
"pinjar by mr dwivedi is an awesome movie. its definitely the greaest and finest of 2003. there are very good performances in it. dwivedi knows what he can extract from mast urmila. she is like u have never seen before. one true great performance. along with her is a fine actor manoj bajpai, who has shown bollywood what he is with bhiku mhatre. the movie is about a girl(urmila) living in pre-partition pakistan. she is from a punjabi family livin in a small town. she is been kidnapped by a muslim guy as a part of a going-on-for-years kinda fight with the punjabi family. and then follows a series of twists and turns as urmila's arranged marriage is due in few days. this movie is truly a very good movie. the storyline is solid with an amazing screenplay. all the performances like lillete dubey, isha koppikar (u wont believ but she can act as well besides jus dancin on khallas), kulbhushan kharbanda and many more. those sets with pre-partition pakistan, costumes, cinematography, sound, background score add to the positive points. from the start till the end u r stuck to u'r seat with the question whats next? this movie is not jus worth watchin but deserved to be a part of your movie collection. the ultimate scene is the end of the movie. i would suggest all those no-kabhi-khushi-kabhi-gum-and-no-dil-to-pagal-hai crowd to watch this amazing flick. my rating: 10/10.",1
"this is actually a pretty bad film. the ideology is not as perverse as in those films collins made later. however, my main misgivings about the film are that it is implausible and quite frankly boring for a long time. the whole concept of an ex-sas man joining terrorists for no particular reason isn't very convincing and you can't help wondering why a group of highly organized terrorists (who later become pretty clueless) fall for it. the film starts with a pretty powerful scene but then meanders for quite a long time building up towards the great finale. overall, i think who dares wins could have been an interesting 45 minutes episode of the professionals but the story doesn't carry a feature film. although reasonably successful at the time this film initiated the demise of collins' career who in the eighties mainly made cheap and dubious soldier-of-fortune or army films. pity, because he actually is quite a versatile actor but at the end of the day martin shaw chose his roles more carefully and has a career that's still successful.",0

"""imagine if you could bring things back to life with just one touch"" as soon as i first heard that, my attention was locked on the trailer, and after the first episode i found my self in love with this show. a modern day fairy tale that brings my spirits up and holds my attention throughout the entire show. i think the acting and casting is just perfect, each character brings something unique to the show that adds to it's perfection. even the one time villains manage to overflow with a unique sense, from the bee man to the guy who can swallow kittens, they never seem to let me down. and the deaths that would normally lead to a depressing moment often end up being purely comical (such as an exploding scratch & sniff book)  even with the large amount of crime shows we have now a days, daisies is one of the few that really stands out from the rest, being not just a mystery but a love story, comedy and a fairy tale with a hint of drama all baked into one wonderful pie.....err show.  what really shocked me was the fact that it was on abc, for years i never had a reason to turn to abc, but this brought me back each week with a smile on my face. it was as if pushing daisies brought abc back to life for me. but just like that, after two seasons, a few awards, a large fan base and positive responses from critics the show has been dropped. it seems as though ned has touched abc again and forever killed it for me. i will always be a fan of this show though, and i recommend this to anyone who likes a lot of talking and a lot of love from the shows they watch.",1
"if this movie was written directed and produced with the intention of creating a bad movie cult classic, it might (i say might) have been a hit. have you ever sat and watched a movie that was so absolutely awful that it becomes fascinating in terms of its faults? well this is it. every one of the acting cast should be nominated for worst acting performance awards. it would be hard to find another film, with this kind of production budget, that contains so little of any value whatsoever. the whole thing, from the opening scenes defies logic. dialogue is completely unbelievable and illogical. ditto for the behaviour and general storyline of the film itself. what is really mind boggling, is that some buffoons in a boardroom actually made decisions to spend money on this piece of trash. wow.",0
"since most review's of this film are of screening's seen decade's ago i'd like to add a more recent one, the film open's with stock footage of b-17's bombing germany, the film cut's to oskar werner's hauptmann (captain) wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler's fuehrer bunker, once inside, they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel, the film then cut's to one of many conference scene's with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer's to ""ultimate victory"" while werner's character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen's are caught up in a fantasy world-some non-bunker event's are depicted, most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit's and his family's difficulty in surviving-this film suffer's from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 year's after ww2 should not have included; the actor portraying goebbels (willy krause) wear's the same uniform as hitler, including arm eagle- goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband-the ""ss"" soldier's wear german army camouflage, the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy's of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker (it was done outside in the courtyard) and lastly, hitler's suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922-most account's agree it was a walther ppk-some bit's of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable, this bit is shown as a cabaret skit, with a intoxicated wounded soldier (his arm in a splint) maniacally goose-stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease/belly dance, all by candlelight... this is actually embarrassing to watch-the most incredible bit is when werner's captain wust gain's an audience alone with skoda's hitler, hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench, drugged and delirious, when werner's character begin's to question him, hitler start's screaming which bring's in a ss guard who mortally wound's werner's character in the back with a gunshot-this fabricated scene is not based on any true historic account-werner's character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare's his own ending, hitler's farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off-screen, the final second's of the movie show hitler's funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner/hauptmann wust-this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film's such as the 1973 remake ""hitler: the last 10 day's"" or the german film ""downfall"" (der untergang) if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story, these last two film's are based on first person eyewitness account's, with ""hitler: the last 10 day's"" being compiled from gerhard boldt's autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and ""downfall"" being done from hitler's secretary's recollection's, the screen play for ""der letzte akte"" is taken from american nuremberg war crime's trial judge michael musmanno's book ""ten day's to die"", which is more a compilation of event's (many obviously fanciful) than eyewitness history-it is surprising that hugh trevor roper's account,""the last day's of hitler"" was never made into a film.",0

"the italian is an astonishingly accomplished film for its time. stunningly shot, with lighting effects that are truly sublime, this is an early gem that clearly reveals reginald barker to be a pioneer director of equal standing to d.w. griffith and maurice tourneur. how much control thomas ince exerted over the production is hard to know, but this film still has extraordinary power. the simple story of an italian immigrant struggling to keep his family alive in new york, is very moving. the themes of social injustice, revenge and forgiveness are completely relevant today. the use of close-ups is outstanding and the powerhouse performance of george beban is electrifying. what we need now is a really good print transferred to dvd so we can truly appreciate this early masterpiece of cinema.",1
"i got the dvd from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production. i have to say, i was very disappointed. the subject had so much potential. the sets in a wagnerian production must, of necessity, be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience. instead, what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery, vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention. i found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas. i was impressed by the sheer enormity of the effort required to put on such a production - that did come across fairly well and next time i am at the opera i am sure i will remember that part if this video - but was left feeling somewhat cheated by the lack of detailed commentary and explanation.",0
"yeah cheap shot i know, but this movie is a great example of how a collection of signifiers of 'deepness' (political turmoil, love/lust) can be combined haphazardly to great critical acclaim (see also 'american beauty'). kaufman's movie plods along with gratuitous sex scenes interspersed with often painful dialog sequences (in one scene i counted three different 'generic european' accents affected by the actors) and displays of state might run amok, yet fails to tie them together into the coherent meditation kundera offered. and in its over-long three hours it manages almost completely to gloss over franz,the missing fourth piece in the love triangle that lies at the heart of the plot, and in this manner sacrifices the novel's central mechanism of displaying the spectrum of emotions and of power relations that obtain in love affairs. it also fails to even include token screen time for tomas' son, used in the novel to exemplify some of the political points kundera was making in the novel. combined with the overweening soundtrack, these flaws make this movie's three hours unbearably weighty in tone yet light in content.",0
"this movie does not rock, as others have said. i found it really boring and silly. the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer. the singer dies, but not before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at, of course, midnight on halloween (which would actually make it november 1st, a much less potent date to be sure). the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back-play messages. it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world.   the first part of this film is not a horror film at all, but rather an after school special. we see the metal kid (the outsider) tormented over and over by the popular kids. and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies: when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party, don't go! it is a trap. especially if it is a pool party. anybody surprised when he ends up in the water?? it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson.  so back to the horror part of the film. so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys (which would have made much more sense), he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm. what? a sensitive hero? what fun is that in a horror movie? thank goodness carrie white did not follow this lesson. he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance, the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him. if it were me, i would have put that music on, and pronto.   the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized. why not partner with him and really do some damage. why you ask? it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not want her hurt..more appropriate for a molly ringwald film. is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast? the movie just goes on and on at this point, with no scares, horror, or anything worth watching. if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did, this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair, but that is it for this film. skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss.",0

"also known in a different form as ""house of exorcism,"" this messy  little film takes itself so seriously as to kill any entertainment value  whatsoever.  the spare plot involves european tourist elke sommer who has a  chance run in with telly savalas, who looks just like the devil she  saw on a fresco in the square. sommer is given a ride to a  mysterious house in the country, where savalas happens to be  butler. there, she is mistaken for a long dead woman, and the real  soap opera theatrics begin. the house's blind matriarch's  husband had an affair with the dead woman, who was the  matriarch's son's fiancee. the couple who gave sommer the ride?  well, the woman is giving the chauffeur, uh, ""back seat driving  lessons,"" and the husband knows and does not care. eventually,  most of the cast is killed, sommer is drugged and raped,  escapes, and the viewer is taken to a climax on board an empty  airplane...which must have resembled the empty theaters this  thing played in.  the alternate version of this, ""house of exorcism,"" has scenes  added involving a priest.  the vhs copy of this, from elite entertainment, is crystal clear and  letterboxed. there are ""extras"" after the end credits; deleted sex  and gore scenes.  mario bava's direction is fast and furious, but his screenplay is  awful. there are half baked ideas, abandoned plotlines, and  stunning conveniences that do nothing more than propel this thing  in some sort of forward direction. you have life like dummies for  practice funerals, the blind matriarch does not act all that blind,  and savalas is given the same lollipops he had in ""kojak,"" (who  haunts ya, baby?).  the project seems like they had two name stars, then wrote the  script quickly, something that happens in hollywood on a daily  occurrence now. savalas looks completely lost, delivering his  lines haltingly, and wishing his character had not died in ""the dirty  dozen."" sommer runs around and screams and gasps a lot, but  her character is a blank, i use the term ""character"" loosely. the  only thing we know about her is her name.  this is a real weird film, and your reaction to it might depend on  how heavily you are into eurohorror, and kojak. i for one cannot  recomment ""lisa and the devil.""  this is unrated, and including all the extras at the end of the vhs  copy, contains strong physical violence, sexual violence, strong  gore, strong female nudity, male nudity, sexual content, and adult  situations",0
"the story of ned kelly has been enshrouded in myth and exaggeration for time out of hand, and this film is no exception. what ensures ned kelly has a permanent place in history is the effort he went to in order to even the odds against the policemen hunting him. during several battles, he marched out wearing plates of beaten iron, off which the bullets available to police at the time would harmlessly bounce. indeed, it is only because there were a few bright sparks among the victorian police who noticed he hadn't plated up his legs that he was captured and hanged. the story has been told in schools and histories of australia for so long that some permutations of the story have, ironically, become boring. the more the stories try to portray kelly as some inhuman or superhuman monster, the less people pay attention.  which is where this adaptation of our sunshine, a novel about the kelly legend, excels. rather than attempting to portray a ned kelly who is as unfeeling as the armour he wore, the film quickly establishes him as a human being. indeed, the reversal of the popular legend, showing the corruption of the victorian police and the untenable situation of the colonists, goes a long way to make this film stand out from the crowd. here, ned kelly is simply a human being living in a time and place where in order to be convicted of murder, one simply had to be the nearest person to the corpse when a policeman found it. no, i am not making that up. about the only area where the film errs is by exaggerating the irish versus english mentality of the battles. while the kelly gang were distinctly irish, australia has long been a place where peoples of wildly varied ethnicities have mixed together almost seamlessly (a scene with some chinese migrants highlights this).  heath ledger does an amazing job of impersonating australia's most notorious outlaw. it is only because of the fame he has found in other films that the audience is aware they are watching ledger and not kelly himself. orlando bloom has finally found a role in which he doesn't look completely lost without his bow, and geoffrey rush's appearance as the leader of the police contingent at glenrowan goes to show why he is one of the most revered actors in that desolate little island state. but it is naomi watts, appearing as julia cook, who gets a bit of a bum deal in this film. although the film basically implies that cook was essentially the woman in ned kelly's life, but you would not know that from the minimal screen time that she gets here. indeed, a lot of the film's hundred and ten minutes feels more freeze-dried than explorative. once the element of police corruption is established, in fact, the film rockets along so fast at times that it almost feels rushed.  unfortunately, most of the film's strengths are not capitalised upon. rush barely gets more screen time than his name does in the opening and closing credits. ditto for watts, and the rest of the cast come off a little like mannequins. i can only conclude that another fifteen, or even thirty, minutes of footage might have fixed this. but that leads to the other problem, in that the lack of any depth or background to characters other than the titular hero leaves the events of the story with zero impact. one scene manages to do the speech-making thing well, but unfortunately, it all becomes a collage of moments with no linking after a while. if one were to believe the impression that this film creates, a matter of weeks, even days, passes between the time that ned kelly becomes a wanted man on the say-so of one corrupt policeman, and the infamous shootout at glenrowan. annoyingly, the trial and execution of ned kelly is not even depicted here, simply referred to in subtitles before the credits roll.  that said, aside from some shaky camera-work at times, ned kelly manages to depict some exciting shootouts, and it has a good beginning. for that reason, i rated it a seven out of ten. other critics have not been so kind, so if you're not impressed by shootouts with unusual elements (and what could more more unusual than full body armour in a colonial shootout?), then you might be better off looking elsewhere. especially if you want a more factual account of ned kelly's life.",1
"when i decided to watch the barbarians, starring those twin bodybuilders, peter and david paul, i thought it couldn't be that bad because the film was directed by ruggero deodato, who has a reputation for creating sleazy movies but well made sleazy movies. well, the barbarians is remarkably trashy action/adventure movie that wants to be another conan the barbarian, and fails at every level. the look of the film is all wrong. some scenes were well shot but the tone and the schintzy, tacky ""disco"" look of the clothes and hair people are adorned with just doesn't make any sense whatsoever, even for a low budget flick like this one.  richard lynch looks like an old woman with that ridiculous hairdo and costume. he's supposed to be menacing but he comes across as a buffoon. and it's funny to see eva larue callahan, one of the stars of all my children, appear in her first movie, walking around in skimpy fur bikini. i'm sure she wants this dreck to disappear from the face of the earth! the so-called barbarian twins are okay as the muscle bound heroes but it's almost impossible to construct a proper critique of their acting because their roles are, like everything else in this mess, really ill-conceived. the only way the film tries to differentiate one twin from the other is by having one twin wear a loincloth that covers his ass, while the other twin's loincloth barely covers his muscular butt. i'm not kidding! don't ask me who's who though.  deodato must have been really desperate to agree to make this film. and his desperation is reflected perfectly in this trashy flick. it's just bad.",0
"i really enjoyed this one, and although the ending made me angry, i still give it 10 out of 10.  four college girls (baltron, kelly, stahl and cadby) are driving down to florida, on their way they meet 2 guys (turner, davis), they really add nothing to the plot, but are at least somewhat likable. the girls agree to meet the guys in florida for some fun, but they have car problems and never make it. one of the girls decides to go to a nearby gas station for help, the other three stay by the car.  soon one of the girls has to use the bathroom, being in the middle of nowhere she has no choice but to go in the bushes. soon she witnesses as a man (march) strangles a woman, in terror the girl flees the area, she doesn't get very far, but manages to get lost.  her friends by the car go looking for her, they too go into the woods and run into the same man, one of them sees the dead woman, the man responds by shooting the girls head off, the other girl runs away, manages to make it back to the car where she is also killed.  eventually the two remaining girls find each other and because they break into the gas station get arrested. this is when i started getting mad, these poor girls are afraid for their lives and the redneck cops don't believe them.  they are treated badly and one of them is left alone for the madman to kill her in the cell, the remaining friend manages to escape, but not without getting in dangerous situations.  this movie has nudity, good actresses, a shower scene imitating psycho, graphic violence towards women and solid story. some women will probably find it offensive and sensitive individuals will not like the ending, but over all, this is a great little unknown movie.",1
"this is a rather dull movie about a scientist that creates a teleporter device and gets horribly disfigured when he uses the machine to transport himself. simple plot done before in the fly and others. not only does he get disfigured, but he also can electrocute people with a touch. what is really dumb about this film is that we are expected to believe the place this guy works is against him. he could probably make millions for the institution that he is working at, but the head of the institution tries to sabotage his teleporter every step of the way. in the end the projected man electrocutes three people for no reason then goes after those that have wronged him.",0

(i might be wrong) but as far as i am aware, the show was conceptualized in 2005 and appeared on global tv in canada in early 2006. it is a fresh idea and hopefully it does well. too bad this couldn't be paired up with corner gas. now i know corner gas is on ctv, but the two shows would be great companion pieces.",1
"i have been known to fall asleep during films, but this is usually due to a combination of things including, really tired, being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot. however on this occasion i fell asleep because the film was rubbish. the plot development was constant. constantly slow and boring. things seemed to happen, but with no explanation of what was causing them or why. i admit, i may have missed part of the film, but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else. i cant recommend this film at all.",0
"wow, not only is this film a ""new lesson in real bad taste,"" but also a lesson in ""real bad film making."" don't get me wrong, i appreciated the concept of 'zombie '90: extreme pestilence,' but at the same time one must realize when a movie is terrible. in case you missed out on the storyline, the plot of 'zombie '90' is about a government plane carrying toxic chemicals that so happens to crash into the wilderness, causing the chemicals to spill, turning locals into hideous looking zombies. the next thing you know, zombies are all over the city eating people alive, while a goofy-looking doctor and a government agent are trying to figure out the disease that's making these people eat one another - hence the name ""extreme pestilence."" from then on, all we see is zombies having a field day on every local in sight - nothing but extreme and sickening disembowelments and dismemberments accompanied by endless buckets of guts and gore. since this is a german film, the film had to be dubbed into english and when you're not laughing at the feeding frenzies of the zombies, the voice-overs are quite hilarious and entertaining as well. as user unratedx mentioned *spoiler* *spoiler* *spoiler*, there is a scene in the film that crosses the line between what's acceptable and not acceptable, hence the scene in which a woman, who is carrying her infant baby, is being wheeled around in her wheelchair by some dude and a horde of zombies come out of nowhere and attack them. one zombie grabs the baby and rips it into pieces, eating its organs as you hear the baby crying. wow, that is a new lesson in reallllllllly bad taste. atrocious i tell you, atrocious.",0
"sorry - this movie is just a cheap tv-production. i saw very much promotion material and expect a professionell movie like ""stormriders"" - what i was presented was a low-budget-movie like ""xena"" or ""hercules"" on tv. no atmosphere, very boring, more then worse fight-scenes. some good ideas - not more. i hope i will get the chance to make a movie like this and then i show how to do such a movie!!!  my asian-tips: ""musa - the warrior"", ""stormriders"", ""shaolin soccer"", ""battle royal"", ""versus"", etc.  sorry for my bad english!",0
"if john thaw had never played ""morse"", ""kavanagh"", or starred in ""the sweeney"" and other productions, he'd be remembered for this wonderfully unforgettable performance in ""goodnight mr tom"".  superbly supported by an equally tremendous performance by his co-star (young nick robinson in his first role), and an unobtrusive cast, this adaptation of michelle magorian's charming novel is a fitting memorial to his art.  when i read this story of an old widowed norfolk countryman having to accommodate a young boy from london before and during the blitz, i found a rather obvious time-line error in it, and credit must go to the makers of this film for rectifying this error. they also must be applauded for not over-sentimentalising the tale, and preventing what could have been turned, quite easily, into a mushy mess.  if you keep a cd or video library then this feel-good made for tv movie is an absolute must inclusion.",1
"definitely, definitely the worst film i've ever seen, no questions asked! contradictors of this opinion might argue that this title should not be judged by the same criteria as others, since it's an independent, low-budget film, but c'mon already  the amateurism and meager innovation is horrifying.  agreeing with everything that has been said about this film, for example the mind numbingly weak acting (when it's this bad you take another go at shooting the scene, god damn it), the thing i found the most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, assuming such a thing existed during the production. there was an obvious absence of a dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls switched personalities several times and they seemed to show absolutely no sing of any rationality or even brains - five relatively fit girls against one slight female psychopath  gang up on her, why don't you?  the only thing that can be regarded as somewhat of a conquest for this title is the camera not leaving the van at any time thus the viewer seeing everything from inside it - which is, as the rest of the film, a good idea executed exponentially dreadfully.  oh and by the way, this movie is nothing like the blair witch project or cloverfield or any other title filmed with a hand-held camera  this is an effect and not a trait! used cleverly it can be breathtaking, but in this case it's an excuse for inadequate cinematography.",0
"i haven't seen much german comedy, but if this film is anything to go by, i'm compelled to see more! the simple but effective storyline takes two very different people on a trip from germany to italy after eva, an unemployed mother of two, discovers that her artist husband is having an affair with the wife of a wealthy lawyer. i won't reveal anything further, but what results is a very funny series of events with the perfect conclusion. my interest in international cinema has expanded since i first saw this film. i recommend it to anyone (any adult... don't let the inclusion of the young children fool you into thinking it's a family film) who love comedy - even those unfamiliar with the language.",1

"i have never posted a review before, but i had to do it for this film! this film is so bad, i found myself trying to justify how bad it is by trying to think of it as kitsch or parody. but it isn't. it is truly, un-self-consciously bad. this is a serious attempt that flops gloriously. other reviewers have pointed out the film's many flaws, so i'll try not to repeat these, but i do urge you to see this film. throughout it i was either speechless, literally gasping with disbelief, or rolling on the floor in hysterics. i haven't had so much fun watching a film in years. in fact, i'm going to try to get all my friends to see it because it's the kind of movie that needs to be shared.  my favorite parts: -- when arthur auditions to be a go-go boy (his dancing is unbelievable) -- the gratuitous nudity (the director/leading actor just had to get a nude shot in) -- the preacher's office with its cardboard and crayon rendition of christ -- of course, the famous wedding scene with the palm trees and the forgotten rings (what narrative function does this play?!?) -- the ex-wife's wrestling match with ben to get possession of her gun -- the detailed sequence wherein arthur kills the preacher; he apparently burns him up with this incredibly measly match -- yes, the gay religious-fanatic brother with his bleached hair and weho fashions -- and, my favorite, the use of joplin's ""the entertainer"" as the opening soundtrack and ""pachebel's canon in d major"" as the closing soundtrack! -- the list goes on and on -- a must see!!!",0
"i love cheesy horror flicks. i don't care if the acting is sub-par or whether the monsters look corny. i liked this movie except for the bewildered feeling all the way from the beginning of the film to the very end. look, i don't need a 10 page dissertation or a sign with big letters explaining a plot to me. but dark floors takes the ""what is this movie about?"" thing to a whole new (annoying) level. what is this movie about?  this isn't exceptionally scary or thrilling but if you have an hour and a half to kill and/or you want to end up feeling frustrated and confused, rent this winner.",0
"here's the good news first. ""spirit"" is the most visually incredible animated film in current home theater release. the artwork and effects are revolutionary, and i recommend that you give this movie a look by virtue of the visuals alone.  and now for the bad news. i really mean it when i say that the animation is the only thing this movie has going for it. you may remember that ""spirit"" got badly trounced by ""lilo and stitch"" last summer. the first person who argues that it was because disney is more well-established and had better advertising can write me a four page long essay entitled ""why 'lilo and stitch''s script didn't stink"".  for all the incredible new animation technology on display in ""spirit"", the story is almost *astonishingly* dull. there is a lesson here, and (needless to say) it doesn't just apply to animated movies. you can have the most mind-blowing visual effects ever to grace the eyes of a mortal, but if your story is boring and, more importantly, we don't care about your characters, it's bad film-making. simple as that. the animation is still mind-blowing; i just can't wait to see what somebody with more imagination does with it.",0
"a true dark noir movie and a very graphic film, nice storyline of a man pursuing redemption, that may have just left it all too late. visually there are some really nice scenes artistically amazing as to what can be done with a minimal budget. full marks to gareth maxwell roberts and team, i look forward to the next project with new ideas although hopefully more british actors would be great. lisa ray looked lovely not seen her before and hope to see her again in the future. subject all interesting sex,drugs and violence. bring it on. i would definitely say to rent this one and check it out if you're in the mood for a semi moody noir.",1
"the sopranos stands out as an airtight, dynamic exploration of american life, and how the american experience is shaped and defined by money. by setting the story in the milieu of the underworld, david chase eliminates all barriers to a grunt, low to the ground and outright mean deconstruction of the post-modern era.   every character represents a facet of american industry. tony soprano exemplifies the beleaguered working stiff, torn between familial duty and a need to keep his ""business"" on an even keel. the convergence of these two things is the imperative that keeps the story moving forward. the characters of christopher, paulie, and bobby reflect the loyal - but self-serving underlings present in every enterprise, who are trusted out of necessity rather than merit. with the character of ralph, joe pantoliano essays a brilliant interpretation of the charismatic psychopath, a twisted businessman who's flourishes of violence are tragically outweighed by his stunning earning power. and dominic chianese is the ultimate symbol of the antiquated old-guard, which maintains power through established relationships and the need of the up- and-comers to deflect blame.  though abrasive and occasionally disturbing, the sopranos has earned its place as the ultimate tv drama.   ps a good companion piece to chase's series would be the shield, another violent drama that manages to make the ugliest of characters interesting.",1
"a warm, sweet and remarkably charming film about two antagonistic workers in the same shop (james stewart and margaret sullavan) who are carrying on a romance via mailbox without either of them knowing it. the key to this film's success is that ernst lubitsch keeps any syrupy sentimentality absent and calls on his actors to give low-key, unfussy performances. as a result, you fall in love with virtually all of them.  there's a strong undercurrent of melancholy running through this film which i appreciated. loneliness is a major theme, most obviously represented in the character of the shop's owner and manager, played wonderfully by frank morgan. he discovers that he's being cuckolded by his wife, and realizes that the successful life he's created for himself isn't enough to keep him from feeling lonely when he doesn't have a partner to share it. this makes the timid romance between stewart and sullavan all the more poignant, because they're both reaching out to this unseen other, who each thinks of as a soulmate before they've even met. of course we know everything will turn out right in the end, but the movie doesn't let you forget the dismal feeling either of them would feel if they found that the reality didn't live up to the fantasy.  lubitsch fills his movie out with a crackerjack cast that has boatloads of chemistry. the little group of shop employees refers to itself throughout the movie as a little family, and that's exactly how it feels to us as well.  this is a wonderful, unsung romance.  grade: a+",1
"twisted, bizarre, enchanting, and hilarious! i couldn't stop laughing watching this film. darren stein presents the movies he made on the family camcorder growing up in southern california in the 1980's. it's an interesting look at a budding filmmaker and his motivations and ability to manipulate for the camera. manipulation is a strong word, however don't we all watch movies to be manipulated in some way or another?   from the beginning, i was amused at the fact that the boys in the films seemed to appear shirtless whenever possible. later, darren comments about his budding homosexuality, and you can see it from the hints (big hints!) of flamboyance at an early age. maybe it was just the warm southern california weather, who knows? as a gay man who also grew up in a nurturing environment, it's great to see that his parents supported and loved him, and that his friends seemed to be entranced with his nascent talent behind the lens.  ""put the camera on me"" offers a look back to the 80's untouched by commercialism. you'll remember the hair, the music, and the fashions. i'm the same age as mr. stein, so the trip back to memory lane was welcome. his solo lip-syncing dance number is priceless, enhanced by the frankie goes to hollywood t-shirt.  the films deal with dark themes at time. child abuse, the holocaust, nuclear war, sexual fantasy, and social dysfunction. no childhood is completely carefree, and the way stein deals with these subjects is interesting to say the least, and hilarious to behold.  watch at your earliest convenience!",1
"let's start this review out on a positive note -- i am very glad they didn't decide to wimp out with tony being shot and do a retrospective season like some people were rumoring. actually, creator and writer of this episode david chase did quite the opposite. we don't actually know if tony will live or die. he's in a coma and his chances of recovering are very slim to none. this episode seemed to move very slow, and the coma induced dream tony was in involving mistaken identity and robed asian monks slapping the sh*t out of him was absolutely, flat-out weird. after 45-minutes i got a little sick of everyone grieving, but that shouldn' t be a reason to slam this episode. it was a weird and unpredictable episode, but it was still well-written and intense. edie falco gave an astounding career-defining performance in this episode as the conflicted wife having to face with her husband's could-be demise. i also found it interesting aj dropped out of school and swore a vendetta against junior, which aj most likely won't have the balls to pull off. silvio is now acting-boss which opens numerous doors to problems in later episodes. there were a lot of great quips in this episode, also, and i think vito 'pole-smoker' spadafore may meet his demise if he keeps being a greedy s.o.b.  this wasn't a great episode and disappointed only because even though tony kills people, we as an audience adore him and feel he is our hero of the show. this was a necessary episode for the series, even though it was a little snore inducing towards the conclusion. kudos to edie falco's performance, and david chase and the writers for creating this wholly original and unpredictable plot twist. this is the only season of 'the sopranos' where i haven't a f*cking clue where it is going to go. i can't wait for next week's episode. my rating: 7.5/10   best line of the episode: (paulie to aj): ""let's go, van helsing!""",1
"another detailed work on the subject by dr dwivedi takes us back in time to pre-partioned panjab. dr dwivedi chose a difficult subject for his movie debut. he has worked on all meticulous details to bring the story to life. the treatment of the subject is very delicate.  even though we have not been to the region during that time, the sets and costumes look real. unlike most movies made on partition, this one focuses not on the gory details of violence to attract audience, but on its after-effects. the characters come to life. priyanshu chatterjee has given an impressive performance. manoj bajpai has acted his heart out showing the plight of a guilt-ridden man. the rest of the cast has done a good job too.",1
"jim henson's muppets were a favorite of mine since childhood. this film makes me feel like a kid again. okay, the muppets are back with miss piggy and kermit the frog and their friends. the premise is that they are trying to get on broadway in a musical show in where else but new york city. you will see cameos by the then new york city mayor ed koch. anyway, the film turns 25 this year and i hope the kids of today will learn to appreciate the lightheartedness of the muppets gang. the problem with the show is kermit goes missing and the gang has to find him in new york city. it's worth watching for kids and even sentimental adults like myself.",1
"the fourth man (paul verhoeven - netherlands 1983).  a film based on a novella by gerard reve, that works best as a thriller. that's quite surprising, considering reve roughly needs a hundred pages for just a minor plot twist and tension is the last thing on my mind when reading his work.  ""the fourth man"" is top-heavy on symbolism. paul verhoeven is generally extremely preoccupied with proving something to mostly hostile critics and i'm never sure what it is exactly he is trying to prove. he usually underestimates his audience and tells his story in such an unsubtle way, he quickly diverges from the original idea or storyline, and almost seems to forget what needs to be seen on screen and what needs to be left out. in ""the fourth man"" he is not as explicit on detailing the plot as he is with sex and nudity (of which there's plenty) but, as in most of his films, he seems afraid the audience wouldn't get it and hammers home the story with overt symbolism mixed with some supposedly shocking nudity and graphic sex scenes. there's hardly a scene without sex or full-frontal nudity, most of it so maddeningly gratuitous and in your face, it undermines an otherwise good story.   nevertheless, when you can cope with verhoeven's pretty obvious satiric approach, it's quite an entertaining thriller at times with some intriguing plot twists and good performances all round, thom hoffman and jeroen krabbé in particular.  camera obscura --- 7/10",1
"life begins is a wonderful pre-code film starring some of the best of the era. it is set in the maternity ward of a hospital, particularly in the room for the women expected to have trouble. in it is an older woman, a tough unwed mother (glenda farrell), a frail young woman, an italian woman, and the main character (loretta young) who is spending 20 years in prison for murder. her husband (eric linden) is at the hospital at every second aching to know that everything will be okay. aline macmahone plays the nurse who is great at her job.  this film is highly interesting and entertaining. it isn't terribly shocking in any way, but it is interesting to see such a neglected subject on the silver screen. the acting is brilliant all around. loretta young is gorgeous here in her prime. eric linden comes out of nowhere and is sincere as can be. his innocence is reminiscent of michael j. fox. glenda farrell is great as always, a staple of pre-codes and for good reason.",1
"marvelous film again dealing with the trials and tribulations of world war 11 england. what makes this film so good is the touching of the human element.this film is definitely in the tradition of such british line classics such as ""mrs. miniver"" and ""hope and glory."" as is the case with this film, we see the desperation of people in the time of war.  the performances are outstanding here especially by the embittered john thaw, who is assigned a child who has been evacuated from the london bombing.  we soon see why this child wets his bed. he comes from a lunatic mother who has abused him terribly.  the old man takes to the child and brings happiness into his sad life. when the child is returned to his mother, the old man goes to london and seeks him out only to find tragedy. he literally kidnaps the boy and is able to convince a higher up that the child is better off with him than being in a boy's home.  the picture is so good because it deals and builds on endearing relationships.",1
this is a must see for anybody who loves thriller's specially political thriller. one scene that stands out is milgram experiment it is shot to perfection very rarely do we get to see a movie shot and scripted the way this movie is presented.  the movie starts with a kennedy like assassination and a three member team is constituted to investigate the assassination. however one of the member does not agree with the final findings of the committee. as per the terms set that member would initiate a one man investigation into the assassination. this investigation gets him involved in into to deep and dark secrets of high office politics and the way they are controlled.,1
"yuck. i thought it odd that their ancient book on curses was made using a common script font instead of hand written. the acting is so apathetic at times and so over-dramatic at other times. why would a ""demonico"" kill the two suspiciously quiet doctors who helped make him immortal? just for the heck of it? and is it really necessary to show lilith's motorcycle whenever she's out somewhere. we get it! you spent a little bit of money to rent some third rate crotch rocket. it doesn't mean you have to show it all the time! the ""faith's"" lair looks like an old school battlestar galactica set with some last minute changes. there is a scene where we are introduced to a few people on a talk show for about 30 seconds before they are killed without apparent reason and without importance. everyone is a throwaway character. forgettable characters and an even more forgettable plot make this one of the most ill-conceived movies i've seen the scifi channel come out with. stay away unless you're into bad movies.",0
"several years ago when i first watched ""grey gardens"" i remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp. years later i still laugh out loud when i watch it, but after many viewings i've come to see the beauty in the strange, twisted relationship between the inseparable ""big"" edith bouvier beale and her daughter ""little"" edith bouvier beale.  mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room east hampton mansion add a whole new meaning to the term ""shabby chic"". with innumerable cats, raccoons and opossums as roommates this aunt and niece of jackie o. allowed filmmakers albert and david maysles into their mansion to film them living life day to day. the result is a hilarious, beautiful, sad and moving account of true love and anarchy rule.  the relationship between big and little edie is a testament to the unbreakable bonds of love. and their lives an example of drive, determination and free-will. this movie has more to recommend it than i can put down into words. it is a rare experience that you must see for yourself.

"this movie was very, very strange and very, very funny. all of the actors are quite real and very odd. the overall ""look"" of the film was different, too, sort of dreamy and bleached-out, which only added to the spacey, fumbling, weird vibe of the whole thing.  it's not for everyone, i mean, it's not what you would call ""mainstream"" but that is what i liked about it. it's unlike anything i have ever seen before . . . unpredictable, with a weird rhythm and punch lines in the strangest places. the kids are so heartbreakingly goofy (and pimply) that you can't help but feel for them. in other words, these are far from ""hollywoodized"" versions of teenagers.  all of, which for me, makes it a good thing.",1
"for those of you unfamiliar with jimmy stewart, this is one of his ""lesser"" films from later in his career. and, while it isn't a great film compared to many of his other pictures, it isn't bad and is a decent time-passer--but not much more.  kim novak is a witch in new york city and for some inexplicable reason, she decides to cast a spell on poor jimmy to make him fall in love with her. over time, the cold and detached ms. novak also begins to fall in love with stewart--and apparently in the witch's rule book, this is a definite no, no!!   the film is odd in its sensibilities about the witches. they are neither the baby-sacrificing nor the all-powerful variety. most of their magic is pretty limited and pointless (such as jack lemmon using his powers to turn off street lamps). and, very oddly, the witches all seem to be bohemians who hang out in hip bars where you might find people wearing berets and listening to crappy jazz. considering what i think of jazz, it must really stink to be a witch in this movie's world!  anyway, the film is pretty romantic and mildly comedic, but not something i would rush out to watch. the acting is pretty good, but the script doesn't offer enough payoff to make this an exceptional film--in fact, i almost scored the film a 6--it was really close.",1
"in bridgeport, the deranged high school teacher richard fenton (johnathon schaech) is obsessed by the teenager student donna keppel (brittany snow); she witnesses him murder her family to stay with her, but richard is arrested and sent to prison for life. three years later, the traumatized donna is feeling better but is still under psychological treatment and taking pills. on her prom night, she goes with her boyfriend bobby (scott porter) and two couples of friends to the pacific grad hotel for the party. but the psychopath richard has escaped from prison and is lodged in the same floor in the hotel chasing donna, stabbing her friends and staff of the hotel that cross his path.  the forgettable slash ""prom night"" is a collection of clichés with a total lack of originality. the stupid story is shallow and silly, with a bad acting of johnathon schaech in the role of an insane killer. the predictable screenplay is amazing since it is possible to foresee what is going to happen in the next scenes. my vote is three.  title (brazil): ""a morte convida para dançar"" (""the death invites to dance"")",0
"is it possible to give a movie no stars? i suppose not. however many stars imdb displays this just think zero and you'll get my drift. director and photographer timothy hines didn't have much of a budget compared to spielberg's herculean effort with the same material (rumored to be the most expensive movie ever made), but that need not be an insurmountable handicap. i've seen some wonderful work done on a comparative shoestring (""soldier and saints"" is a recent example). with hard work, integrity and, above all, talent it is certainly possible to realize a faithful rendition of wells' novella -- and at fraction of what was spent by dreamworks on its ""war of the worlds"". unfortunately, hines failed in all these departments. even if he had had spielberg's budget and tom cruise signed for the lead his movie would have stunk just as badly as this barnyard animal he's foisted on us.  primarily, hines seems unable to tell a story. thanks to digital video technology he can record images and sound, but he shows little aptitude for assembling a narrative with what he records. a guy walks down a country lane, a lot. he talks badly aped received english to some other guy. then he walks down the same lane, only shot from the back this time to show he's returning -- clever, eh? walking and talking, for nearly an hour that's all that happens. ok, i'll grant that one extended excursion from the main character's house to the impact site on horsell common to show that it's a considerable distance from one place to the other might be useful (a first-year film student could storyboard a more economical and more aesthetical establishing sequence than this, btw), but half a dozen times? back and forth, back and forth, et cetera, et cetera with some yakkity-yak in between. remarkable. the only explanation for this surfeit of redundancy other than total artistic ineptitude is a desire to pad out thirty minutes of wretchedly amateurish cg works into something that could be offered as a feature-length film. finally the martian fighting machines appear and the walking and talking becomes running and talking, or shrieking. later we get staggering and wailing for dessert.  thankfully, much of the dialogue is lifted straight from h.g. wells' text; else we'd have no idea what is going on. but is it not the whole point of cinema to illuminate a text, to realize what words alone can't convey? if a film relies on dialogue or monologue to tell us what we see or how to feel, why bother? why not do a radio play? orson welles made himself a household name doing just that. however, hines thinks he's a filmmaker, so he's content to mouth the words and swallow the meaning.  secondly, hines was able to buy some cg effects of a sort for his movie, but he has no idea how to use them. now i for one have no unquenchable sweet tooth for eye candy. i believe good science fiction cinema doesn't need dazzling technical effects. some really potent sci-fi's have flourished on virtually none at all. but ""the war of the worlds"" as film requires a certain baseline effort. wells tells a story that hinges on things can be seen and heard and even smelled. the effects don't need to be complex; they can even be crude (e.g. fighting machines on wires gliding over miniature streets as seen in the george pal/byron haskins 1953 version), but they must be handled well. unfortunately hines' effects are both crude and incompetent  tripod fighting machines higher than a cathedral spire stomp around making a noise like a pogo stick bouncing on linoleum  martian squidoids even though oppressed by four times the gravity of their native world scurry and flit about without perceptible effort  skeletons totally denuded of flesh and muscle writhe and scream -- the same damn horse and buggy greenscreens its way across the foreground a dozen times (flipped left for right occasionally in hope that we might not notice)  and on ad nauseum. crude technique is forgivable. so you have a cg fire effect that's less than convincing? fine, we can work around that. just don't use it too often and only show glimpses of it. that stomped woman sequence looks more like a crushed plum? throw it away. it's not necessary. you say your martian flyer looks like a toy on a string? if you must use it, go ahead, but please don't show it twice! but no, hines won't listen. we get the worst looking stuff used again and again. gotta get those 180 minutes somehow, boy.  next we have acting, or more precisely too much acting. whether in a speaking role or just paid to die on queue everybody in this film is acting his little heart out. evidently hines thinks he's getting a bargain -- more fleeing in terror over there! you, quaking behind that tree, let's have a real conniption fit this take. you call that writhing in agony? nonsense, my grandmother can writhe better -- nevertheless the cast as a whole and individually stink. they aren't even good amateurs. but this needn't prove fatal. many a good movie has been made with rancid acting. that's what directors are for. and editors. which brings up another point who the hell let tim hines edit this cheese factory? if america's butchers were as adept at meat cutting as hines is at film cutting your next hamburger would be all fingers and no beef. in spite of the near three-hour running time there is lots of stuff missing from this movie -- not sequences, but single frames, creating a herky-jerky effect that's nauseating to watch. maybe hines intention was to simulate the effect of a hand cranked cine camera of the 1890's. if he was i can say he doesn't know how to do it.",0
"we tend to forget that the master/slave context of the past centuries lead to more than well-tended estates, powered by large groups of enslaved people, and a lot of money for the white owners. it lead to a group of people caught in the middle - the offspring resulting from slave owners interferring with their female slaves.  some of these children just became more slaves, and others were free...but free and coloured, which back then meant anything but, relative to the lot of their sires.  a class formed around these offspring - the gens de couleur libre or free people of colour - and that class was able, to a certain extent, to own property, raise themselves from downtrodden to educated, and to attain a comparative dignity. that is to say, they weren't slaves, but they were still exploited to a certain extent.  often, the women lived as mistresses to the white plantation masters and men of wealth, set up in their own houses, with allowances, schooling paid for for their children, and a kind of gentility, dependent on the respectability they chose to impose on their families. in essence, they were prostituting themselves to ensure their own prosperity, and relative independence from labour - an arrangement called plaçage.  feast of all saints is a beautifully written story about the children of one such woman, the result of just such an arrangement with a local gentleman, and the people who touched on their lives, in both a negative and a positive way. the tale was an eye-opener for me, a new zealander, with no real conception of the black/white lines, let alone that grey area in the middle where the gens de couleur libre trod gingerly.  the characters are very three dimensional, and have been well-rendered in this adaption of the novel, by anne rice. the parts are well-cast, the costumes are wonderful, and the brutal way the lines are drawn out, with the blurred areas made all the more distinct by the conflicts the protagonists go through. the gens de couleur libre could not marry the whites, the slaves could not help themselves, and the whites, even the sympathetic ones, couldn't bear to face the economic reality of doing right by the people they depended on.  i recommend this story, both the novel and the miniseries, to everyone, unreservedly. if you can't handle the truth you'll cringe and cower through some parts, as one injustice after another is meted out on those of colour, both by their white oppressors, and by their own people. bear in mind though that this is nothing more than reality, and this tale is an absorbing way to learn about it.  i know it may sound callous, but this miniseries both entertained me and enthralled me, despite the sour taste i found in my mouth at what went on, and i thoroughly enjoyed it. watch it. if not read up on the period, because there's a lesson to be learned from it all.",1
"any movie in which brooke shields out-acts a fonda is going to be both an anomaly and a horror. shields actually is only bad because she's youthful, inexperienced, and clearly not well directed by her co-star. peter fonda is bad because, well, because he's bad. i liked him in ulee's gold, years later, but lord above, he's awful here. not that anyone else is good. there's not a single performance (outside henry fonda's delightful cameo) that is even passable. i've never seen a movie with this many bad performances. in the case of luke askew, the chief villain, it's clear this is because of poor dialogue and direction, as he's done good work in the past. but his partner, played by ted markland, is an embarrassing ham. the writing is just bloody awful, and the actors cannot be faulted for the terrible things they have to say. but they say them so badly! the editing and direction are worse than pedestrian. shots are held way too long for no dramatic reason, or cut off before the impact of the scene can be realized. this picture was far worse than i'd imagined and would have been utterly forgotten (and probably never even made) without the participation of a couple of famous names. one bright spot: the cinematography in the grand canyon is exquisite, capturing the beauty of that area in a way even big-screen imax productions have not quite done so well. and finally: either this is a bad version of paper moon, with a lovable pair of father-daughter types, or it's a bad version of pretty baby, with a considerably more icky romantic relationship between a forty-something and a 13-year-old. it suggests more of the latter than the former, and thus is pretty disturbing.",0
"christopher durang must have been taught by a memorably awful nun, because he just can't let go of the concept. the play, ""sister mary ignatius explains it all for you,"" was presented -- at least in hollywood -- in precisely the same tone as diane keaton's lecture scenes here. sister mary was an exaggeration, a lampoon, a bitter satire of a serenely confident, doctrinaire and highly judgmental nun -- and as played by lynn redgrave, she was hilarious. but the movie insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously -- while, as mentioned, maintaining the same tone in the ""explains it all"" scenes. the two approaches clash headlong and in the last twenty minutes, the movie goes off the track, plunges into the gorge, and explodes. there are no survivors. it could have worked, if the tone of the scenes with the four former students, and their encounter with sister mary, been pitched the same as the sister mary scenes. or if the sister mary scenes been presented more realistically. this way simply doesn't work at all.",0
"this movie is great fun to watch if you love films of the organized crime variety. those looking for a crime film starring a charismatic lead with dreams of taking over in a bad way may be slightly disappointed with the way this film strides.  it is a fun romp through a criminal underworld however and if you aren't familiar with hong kong films, then you may be pleasantly surprised by this one. i was somewhat disappointed by some of the choices made story-wise but overall a good crime film. some things did not make sense but that seems to be the norm with films of the east.   people just randomly do things regardless of how their personalities were set up prior. it's a slightly annoying pattern that permeates even in this film.",1
"i'd like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot(!) for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest, crappiest movie i've ever seen!  i have no idea what's wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here (imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings)... the only thing i can imagine is that people must've voted during one or more conditions:  1. while being shitfaced / stoned out of their minds 2. they've received hard cash for the votes 3. under gunpoint  i can't believe i wasted a good 1 h 45 min of my life for this pathetic excuse for a movie.",0
"corny! i love it! corny - just as the tv show was about 40 years ago! adam and burt rekindle the same on-screen chemistry that never seems to have left! they re-live old memories, plus the actors that play them from the 1960s show some behind-the-scenes things which are quite interesting to know. 1960s tv was corny escapism for so many of us back then, and this dvd is no exception, if you are familiar with the original tv show. the fight scene with the written boofs and bams or whatever is fantastic!! the movie theater scene shows clips of the villains who passed away. at the end frank gorshin makes an appearance. he passed away not too long after this dvd was made, i believe, so it is to his great credit that he came back to again play a villain to adam and burt, just as he did to batman & robin so many years ago. he didn't lose his touch! thanks to julie newmar to re-living a villain role, also. in conclusion i think that this dvd is for great memories, and i wish to thank both adam and burt for coming back and recreating these memories for those of us who remember the original-!!! thanks, guys!!!",1
"when i was in school i made a film about a couple roaming around in the trees and talking, and i realized halfway through editing that this was not just a failing aesthetic strategy but a cliché of canadian cinema: sodden lyricism married to vacant, metaphor-burdened stabs at social commentary. but whatever my own film's failings i feel much better after seeing this...this...thing. for one thing, mine ran 20 minutes, not 85, and had more content at that: every pointless bit of business here is fawned over for four, five, six relentless minutes. the male lead is just incredible, a brow-beating, loudmouthed creep given to outbursts of drama-class improv in between philosophical insights culled from the u of t pub, and he is given lots and lots of space to make us hate him. admittedly if he weren't such an a**hole then the third act would make even less sense, as a couple snarky dudes show up to provide distant and thoroughly unhelpful echoes of 'exploitation' values; but it doesn't make it any easier to watch the caged creep whimper ""please"" in closeup until the magazine runs out. i take back what i said about autumn born, which at least had the courage of its own misbegotten lechery: this cinematic crater is and will remain the very worst canadian movie of all time. at least, i really really hope so.",0
"having heard so many people raving about this film i thought i'd give it a go. apart from being incredibly slow, which i don't mind as long as the wait is worth it, but it just isn't. as many others have said there are so many inconsistencies and so much of this film just doesn't ring true. the reaction of the 4 men switches from shock, horror on finding the body to complete indifference whilst they fish. surely if they were the type of men that would go on happily fishing, then they would have just reported the body and said they had only discovered it after their fishing trip....why on earth tie the body to a tree, go fishing and then tell everyone you found the body 2 days previously? its so hard to watch a film knowing that the behaviour of the main characters is so inconsistent. as for the rest of the townsfolk, well you'd think at least one of them might show some curiosity about who actually killed the woman! the body itself, naked except for the knickers....what scenario leads to that? if she was raped then why still the knickers? if she was raped with the clothes on, then why remove them afterwards bar the knickers? if she wasn't raped, then why take all her clothes off bar the knickers....leaving yourself with evidence to dispose of? i truly cant think of any realistic scenario that would lead to that other than killing someone to steal their clothes so you can fill up your jumble sale stall! oh well its watchable but only just and only because, despite the poor script, the acting is strong.",0

"i first watched the walking tall movies when i was about 8 years old and i thought both joe don baker and bo svenson did a great job, they must have anyway because since watching the movies, i have tried to learn as much about the real sheriff buford pusser as i can. all 3 parts of the movie gave me chills and buford pusser was a true hero, i only wish he were alive today and that there were more people like him. i would love to thank him for getting rid of all the crime and being so brave. i am very sorry that his family had to go through such horror and pain. my heart goes out to them. so from a 30 year old fan of sheriff pusser and of the 3-part walking tall movies and the actors that portrayed him, please do not be negative about these movies and actors, they were only trying to let us know what a wonderful man the real buford pusser was and what a great family he had. and to all the young people who may have not heard much about buford, i suggest you watch the walking tall movies and learn more about him.",1
"this one is considered a key pre-code film  from the director who later made the musical biopic the jolson story (1946), but also the paranoid sci-fi invasion u.s.a. (1952)!  and features one of barbara stanwyck's best early roles.  she's supported by a fine cast which includes popular actors and valued character performers of the day  george brent, douglass dumbrille, edward van sloan, nat pendleton and john wayne (at one point addressing stanwyck with the titular nickname, derived from a popular song which is heard constantly throughout) in the former category and, in the latter, robert barrat (as stanwyck's father), donald cook (as her most tragic conquest), alphonse ethier (as her elderly mentor  more on this later), arthur hohl (as a lecherous politician) and henry kolker (as cook's boss and father-in-law, whom stanwyck also seduces). curiously, scenes in which walter brennan appeared were subsequently deleted at his own request when the film ran into trouble with the censors!  abetted by crackling i.e. typically hard-boiled dialogue and realistic anton grot sets, the narrative contains unexpected overtones of nietzschean philosophy fed to our small-town heroine by the intellectual ethier (stanwyck complains to him early on that she's no ""ball of fire"" which, of course, contradicts her later comedy  directed by howard hawks and co-starring gary cooper  of that name!). under ethier's auspices, she quickly blooms into an essentially heartless character determined that nothing shall stand in her path to success; the symbolic depiction of her rise in stature at the new york firm she's eventually employed with is reminiscent of a similarly sardonic one  relating to an ambitious statesman's lust for power  in sergei eisenstein's october (1927)! sociologically, it's also interesting that stanwyck is constantly seen sticking her neck out for her black maid/companion.  the first two-thirds of the film are simply terrific; at first, i found the latter stages somewhat disappointing  because i was expecting to see stanwyck get her comeuppance by falling for the belatedly-introduced george brent character while he ignores herbut, just like the others, he's soon under her spell! on second viewing, however, this aspect felt less jarring  as it's evident that stanwyck has been affected by the two deaths her selfish behavior has caused, and that her tenure in paris has softened her (even if she tries to cling to her hard-earned wealth for as long as it's possible).  released on dvd by warners as part of their forbidden hollywood volume 1 collection, the film is presented in two strikingly different edits  a recently unearthed pre-release version and the tamer theatrical release print. among the considerable footage cut from the latter is dialogue pertaining to stanwyck's life as a tramp from the age of 14 (though it's heard in the accompanying trailer!), while many other scenes have been shortened (i.e. censored for content): the violent fisticuff which develops between stanwyck and hohl after she resists his advances; the seduction at the railroad car; the scene in which dumbrille is surprised with stanwyck by cook; the shooting, followed by a suicide (only shots are heard in the shorter version); stanwyck thinking about her conquests while the phonograph is playing (again, only brent appears in the version released to theaters), etc. tha latter, then, utilizes alternate takes for some scenes  and includes an establishing shot of the city which is missing from the longer version; however, we also get an obviously tacked-on happy ending (the pre-release version concludes abruptly on a very effective open-ended note) and an equally unconvincing cautionary letter sent by ethier to stanwyck in new york which, basically, has the function of substituting all references to nietzsche!",1
"this is an excellent show! i had a us history teacher in high school that was much like this. there are many ""facts"" in history that are not quite true and mr wuhl points them out very well, in a way that is unforgettable.  mr wuhl is teaching a class of film students but history students and even the general public will appreciate the witty way that he uncovers some very well known fallacies in the history of the world and strive to impress them upon that brains of his students. use of live actors performing ""skits"" is also very entertaining.   i highly recommend this series to anyone interested in having the history they learned as a child turned upside down.",1
"a lot of people seemed to have liked the film, so i feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review. but after sitting through 96 minutes of it, i feel i have to do so. where the heck is the plot in this film?! i must have missed it, i was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened. sure the ending was ""somewhat shocking"" but they didn't build up to it. i forgot who was who half of the time, so they didn't really develop the characters. the acting was so-so, most of the time it was believable, but i was able to see through it most of the time. so... without giving anything away, i must say that unless you like the actors in the film, there is no real reason to watch this movie. i could be mistaken, but i just didn't understand why there was so little, or too much of the film. i can't decide which one that would be, so i say judge for yourselves. i don't even know if renting it would be a good idea, the cost and all...   plot: 0/10 characters: 1/10 acting: 2/10 overall: 3/10 i feel like that's too high really, i am staying with my vote up at the top.",0
"i am an avid b-rate horror film buff and have viewed my fair share of slasher pictures, so i have a substantial gauge to judge this film by. it easily ranks in the upper echelon of the worst horror films the 1980's has to offer. it isn't as scary as night of the demons, it isn't as gory as re-animator and lacks the camp value of there's nothing out there. that being said, this film has no value. keep in mind, the movie artwork is for a completely different film. the stills shots on the back of the dvd box aren't taken from this film.  violence: $$$ (there is plenty of violence but we've seen it all before. a murderer kills nubile students and the occasional facility member by slitting throats and all the other tired methods of murder that horror films utilize).  nudity: none   story: $$ (the story focuses on francine forbes - who wisely changed her name to forbes riley after this film was made - who accepts a job teaching at a university. people start to die and forbes believes the killer is targeting her. is it her new heartthrob with a checkered past or the libido-crazed student? to be honest, it is impossible to care because the script doesn't flesh out any character outside forbes).  acting: $ (terrible on all levels. this slasher has the feel of a school production -high school that is because college students could make a better flick than this. forbes showcases a modicum of talent as does seminara as one of the students, but everyone else is of the ""extras"" caliber of acting).",0

"wow it's ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago.  anyways, i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl, for the record.  the movie was ridiculous. the characters drove me insane, they were so cliché and stereotyped. this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard. it had way too many plot twists too.  there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however, the scene: ""warm heart, cold gun"" where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower. (well, actually they were all obnoxious.) but his acting in that scene was excellent. the look on his face, it reminded my of american psycho (a good movie). the scene is worth seeing but not worth seeing the rest of the movie for, do yourself a favor and don't watch it.",0
"""smokey and the bandit"" wasn't exactly shakespeare, but then nobody wanted it to be. it was lowdown slapstick, but it did have brains. it had a very smart script with definable characters and a fun wrap-up. people came out of the theater smiling.

"if anybody really wants to understand hitler, read wwi history not wwii history. find out what happened during that war, how soldiers had to live around dead corpses all the time. how so many soldiers went insane, from what they saw during wwi, at the time they called it ""shellshocked"" now the call it post-traumatic stress disorder. if you learn the true horrors of wwi, you will begin to understand hitler. you will understand how a human being can become desensitized to death, not because their evil but simply because it was the only way for them too cope with the horrors around them.  this movie unfortunately misses that, as so many others do. read some books on the subject and you should watch the movie ""paths of glory"", the only good wwi movie ever made. you will see the frustration of the soldiers in that movie, the sense of helplessness, and a utter devaluation of human life, as nothing more than bullet catchers.  thats what this movie misses, its really the key point to understanding germany. a lost war, where millions and millions of germans lost their lives, for no real reason. then comes an utter economic collapse, following the war. those are the factors that create extremism.  the loss of family members and massive poverty will create always lead to extremism. unfortunately this movie ignored these factors, and has just become another throw away piece of crap to throw on the pile. with really no real value, there are fictional movie's based upon fictional characters that could give you a better idea of hitler than this does. they just threw hitlers name on this so it would sell more.",0
"well what i can say about this movie is that it's great to see so many asian faces. what i didn't like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role. the asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead, the white guy infatuated with asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the ""keeping it real"" black cab driver. plus all the coke, shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious. the story plot itself was fun but pretty much how i thought the story would unravel. then again when watching romantic comedies you can't expect much but then again i would have been wanted to just be surprised at least once. the parents are the best part of the flick.",0
"this is a typical example of technically highly skilled directors of video clips/commercials trying to do their first full feature length movie. on one hand the imagery, camera, lighting, cgi and even the sound are highly polished and have a truly ""expensive"" look and feel. even the actors show a certain amount of potential - unto the point where even the best acting could not hide a bad plot.  in this case it is not a bad plot but hardly a plot at all.  so 50% of the dialog consists of ""what the hell was that ?"", ""what was that ?"" and ""what the hell was that ?"". in none of the cases any of the characters nor the audience is provided with the slightest hint of an answer though. in most of the other dialogues one gets the feeling that there never was any form of dialogue book and the actors had to freely improvise to a plot that wasn't ever explained to them.  the only reason why skye bennet's performance could be so good is that her character as an autistic girl didn't allow giving her these tragically horrible dialogue lines the other actors had to deal with. that way she was able to just show her acting talent which the rest of the cast couldn't even get close to. i mean there's not one actor in the world that could make up for a dialogue like this:  ben: is this real, huh ? emily: stop it. ben: a mass psychosis, huh ? jon: somebody has to take control of this situation. ben: this situation can't be controlled. not by you, not by anybody. emily: not by you either. ben: no  got me goosebumps. but not for horror, more for the horrible attempt. in some moments i felt ashamed for the actors to have added this to their vita.  2 stars for the excellent technical work.",0

"""purple rain"" has never been a critic's darling but it is a cult classic - and deserves to be. if you are a prince fan this is for you.  the main plot is prince seeing his abusive parents in himself and him falling in love with a girl. believe it or not this movie isn't just singing and dancing. there are many intense scenes and it is heartwarming. sometimes it comes off has funny but when it works it really works. very hit and miss.  no one can really act in the film. everyone is from one of prince's side acts like ""the time"" and ""vanity 6"". still, it adds charm to the movie. when ever prince is on screen he lights it up and it fun to see him at his commercial peak.   in conclusion, go and see this if you love prince like me. if you aren't a fan it'll make you one.",1

"remember ralph bakshi? the guy that was an animator on terrytoons, then on paramount cartoon studios, after that, he was a director on fritz the cat 1 & 2 and heavy traffic? well, this is coonskin. and it's actually pretty good. racist, but good. the movie takes place in harlem nights (no, duh, it was a working title.) but with a twist that becomes a lampoon of a disney movie, song of the south.  it's about sampson (barry white) and the preacherman (charles gordone) rush to help their friend, randy (philip michael thomas) escape from prison, but are stopped by a roadblock and wind up in a shootout with the police. while waiting for them, randy unwillingly listens to fellow escapee pappy (scatman crothers), as he begins to tell randy a story about ""three guys, i used to know, just like you and your friends"". pappy's story is told in animation set against live-action background photos and footage.  brother rabbit (voice of thomas), brother bear (voice of white), and preacher fox (voice of gordone) decide to pack up and leave their southern settings after the bank mortgages their home and sells it to a man who turns it into a brothel. arriving in harlem, rabbit, bear, and fox find that it isn't all that it's made out to be. they encounter a con man named simple savior, a phony revolutionary leader who purports to be the ""cousin"" of black jesus, and that he gives his followers ""the strength to kill whites"". in a flashy stage performance in his ""church"", savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppressionrepresented by images of john wayne, elvis presley and richard nixon, before asking his parishioners for ""donations"".  rabbit first goes up against madigan, a virulently racist and homophobic white police officer and the bag man for the mafia, who demonstrates his contempt for african americans in various ways, including a refusal to bathe before an anticipated encounter with them (he believes they're not worth it). when madigan finds out that rabbit has been taking his payoffs, he and his cohorts, ruby and bobby, are led to a nightclub called ""the cottontail"".  a black stripper distracts him while an lsd sugar cube is dropped into his drink. madigan, while under the influence of his spiked drink, is then maneuvered into a sexual liaison with a stereotypically effeminate gay man, and then shoved into clothes that women were representative of the racist archetype, adorned in something racist, and finally shoved out the back of the club where he discovers that ruby and bobby are dead.  then, while recovering from his delirium of being drugged, shoots his gun around randomly, and is shot to death by the police after shooting one of them.  rabbit, bear, fox and the opponent boxer rush out of the boxing arena as it blows up. the live-action story ends with randy and pappy escaping while being shot at by various white cops, but managing to make it out alive.  this movie was controversial at that time of release, and was re-edited by the director several times under the title, street fight, which is obvious, since street fight is a 2005 documentary about racism in the streets. in fact, this movie has the same subject as the documentary.  that caused bryanston pictures, the distributor of this film and the original tobe hopper classic, texas chainsaw massacre, to go out of business. because paramount wanted to produce and distribute this film, but due to racism, bryanston took over bakshi's production.  despite the controversy, it was worth the entertainment. the animation was awesome at that time, the plot makes sense, and it's actually funny too.  final verdict: 9/10",1
"the best laurel and hardy shorts are filled to the brim with mishaps, accidents and destruction, mostly caused by stan, but with ollie receiving the bulk (!) of the punishment-- see the great 'the music box' (1933) or 'towed in a hole' (1932) as some some classic examples.  here, however, for some reason (is it because it was based on a sketch by stan's father?) the boys play it 'straight' in a 'comedy' built around jokes and supposedly funny situations. it doesn't come off. it's merely another third-rate tedious 30s comedy, heightened only by the personalities of stan and ollie who never really display any of their trademarked gestures (ollie's finger wiggling, stan's blank stares, etc.) or comic abilities.  the film begins with them running from the police. since we never see or know why, it's hard to believe or accept their fear of being caught, and thus hiding in colonel buckshot's mansion. the premise for the 'humor', ollie passing himself off as the colonel and stan passing himself off as both the butler and the maid are never very engaging. they are not playing 'stan and ollie' in this film. their parts could have been played by any of the pedestrian studio actors and it would be just as poor.  stan could mime and make whatever he would do funny, but he doesn't get the chance to do any of that here. he's constrained by uttering too much dialog to 'move' the plot, but none of it rises much above the silly. we are treated to endless third rate comedy chestnuts such as the running gag of not correctly pronouncing lord plumtree's name, the ""call me a cab! okay you're a cab!"" joke, cops losing their clothes and being seen in long johns, and a non-sequiter ending of stan and ollie as the two parts in a painfully obvious horse costume as they make their escape on a bicycle for two, and james finlayson is still doing his silent-era full body takes and keystone kop jumping jacks.  stan and ollie do much better in a situation comedy in 'sons of the desert'(1933) where we get to see them do what we love about them -- be themselves. in fact, 1932-34 seem to be their best years.  since this film does not play to any of their strengths, why bother with it? i have to give it a 3.",0
"i saw this obvious schlock fest on a video store shelf. and before i got my first vcr i figured i'd christen it with this little gem and it's bad film-making at it's finest!  the dialog is inadvertently hilarious. and it contains a cameo with donald trump. anthony quinn is in it inexplicably. and much like christopher walken seemed to want to star in every bad movie in his later years. this movie is mr. quinn's country bears.  it features lines like, ""shut up and let me fight!!!""  and ""you're saying a lot of sh_it!""   and the priceless comeback: ""unfortunately it is sh_it, tough angry sh_it!""  you'll be awed by a fight scene as bo does a sommersault across a billiard table! and does a nice kung fu kick when she comes up from the roll! chop socky action and t and a thrills!!!  what schlock movie fan could ask for more? oh, and when mr. quinn's character commits suicide and and comes back to haunt bo as a ghost she asks him why he killed himself rather then deal with his debilitating illness? he says, ""real men don't eat quiche.""  uh, aaa, yeah. if bo was a smart cookie she woulda called for an exorcist right then and there!",0
"i hate plane crash movies...all of them! in fact, i hate them all with a passion! first of all, they are cheap-looking and have no craftsmanship! secondly, they insult the airline industry and say to the audience that all planes do is...fall out of the sky and crash!  why i wince at such a film? this could happen to any of us and with worser consequences than those suffered by the characters in said movie...which is the only chilling aspect of an airline disaster yarn such as this. i hate this movie because it's like all the 50,000,000 stupid-ass airplane chaos movies before it! freefall is like all the others: nothing more than boredom before the clichéd bullshit dramatic scenes take place.   first, off we have same cast of retards on this flying death trap: the cleaver-esquire family of three, the yuppie baastard, and the bitch of a flight attendant complete with a big blond hairdo from 1987 scolding anyone who is the least bit frightened!   my second gripe is this shouldn't be a full-length movie, but a documentary explaining everything about the air canada ""gimbli glider"" incident a.k.a ""freefall"" right down to the safety precautions.  my third and final gripe is with all airline films of this caliber(with the exception of fearless) why the hell did the male steward instruct the passengers to remove there shoes? (i could understand high heels and sharp, loose objects, but c'mon!)like that's gonna' make them any more f#*king safer than they are now! this plane if they(the passengers) didn't know any better: knew they were going to crash land. why would you force 100 injured people down a rubber slide that can cause skin to peel and bleed on impact only to walk in their stocking feet on a debris field! does this make any sense to anyone?  fearless and the hit abc series ""lost"" had more depth and realism to air disaster than just ""plane malfunctions-people panic-stewards become assholes-plane lands without wheels in a field-people wander without shoes and jackets, etc. the same old crap from airport 1975! freefall was so typical of a air-crash movie that i almost expect to see either charlton heston or peter graves burst into the damn passenger cabin at any moment. could we at least see how these poorly-acted characters go back to normalcy instead of people rejoicing amidst the impending tragedy that is staring in front of them? typical moronic lifetime movie! cheap and stupid!   the director of ""freefall"" should stick to cheap made-for-tv movies with white middle-aged women with stupid teenage kids who do drugs and have marital problems. as for suspense...leave it to the professionals...you hack! why should we the audience sit through over an hour and a half of this airport wannabe rehash. i hope to god they don't make plane crash movies like this anymore. if this were like the abc series ""lost"" then it would be something to watch. but this is utter crap and then some. stop turning every plane disaster movie into ""airport 1975""! this is not ""airport"" this is cheap pathetic waste of my time. i would not recommend this movie or any made-for-tv air disaster movie to anyone not even my worst enemies.",0
"it's been a while since seeing this the first time, so i watched it again with the second movie in the series. while i realize there is a 3rd movie out that i haven't seen yet, i'll review under the original title...  just from the standpoint of production value, screen writing, and movie making, this movie fails on many levels, though it succeeds on a few as well. what can you expect from a low-budget, ""b"" movie? not much, and it works from the standpoint of production. however, the writing is certainly disjointed, with little in the way of character development...exactly what i'd expect when there is an agenda to a film. i didn't have a problem with the acting...the cast is solid; however, the screenplay in both movies gives the actors little opportunity to really stretch themselves. because the film is ""christian,"" this is predictable, as you can't very well portray violent chaos of the ""end times"" without also breaking some of the ethics which are normally associated with christianity. in other words, the mistake comes in making this into a g-rated film when the content, even in the most conservative of bible interpretations, would be r-rated by any measure. so, if the purpose of the movie is to scare people into christian faith, then the movie should be somewhat scary, right? however, you can't comment on a film adaptation from a book without commenting on the book, or in this case, series of books. there are certainly plenty of christian materials worthy enough to be made into movies...but not the ""left behind"" series...and these movies ultimately fail because, while being best-sellers, they are poorly written novels based on bad theology.  as a southern baptist minister, i confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, though i have yet to finish the last two books of the series. i have described them as decent fiction, and if the books would take the point of view that this is one ""possibility"" or interpretation of the subject of biblical eschatology (study of the ""end times), then i could live with that. however, this series is divisive in christian circles because it promotes the ""literalist"" interpretation of all scripture above a more proper hermeneutic. inevitably, this leads to the ""pre-trib, pre-millenial"" dispensation point of view, which confines an all-powerful god far too by humanity's world. in other words, as i've always said, god shouldn't need our helicopters and bombs to do his ultimate work. but because many people, particularly unstudied christians, can't think beyond their own world-views, we are left with a pro-conservative, fundamentalist stance with regard to bible interpretation, and attempts to push it through as the ""only"" interpretation.  thus, the books carry with them an agenda, not so much to get the ""lost"" to understand their need for christ, but to state that the fundamentalist point of view is the only valid way to understand the bible. i recall very clearly reading (several years ago) in the second novel a scene where the characters reference a person who was ""left behind"" because of his non-adherence to this point of view; as if ""real"" christians worthy to be ""raptured"" couldn't possibly hold to another eschatology. this is disturbing for several reasons, the least of which is because a ""rapture"" is only briefly mentioned in scripture and it's connection to real, end-time prophecy is tenuous at best.  but the real issue with these books is comes in the way they divide the christian community and how they portray ""true"" christian behavior. ultimately, i feel they harden more people to an otherwise legitimate faith/religion instead of win people towards it. it turns all christians into caricatures, equally disdained and laughed at by the world despite the fact that there is theological room for a wide diversity of believes within christian thought and practice. as a christian body, on the whole, we've done enough of that kind of damage to society over 2000 years of history...and we certainly don't need to promote it by film to thousands, maybe millions of others.  thus, the ""left behind"" movies fail because the ""left behind"" books aren't worthy to be interpreted into movies.",0
"as soon as i knew keira knighteley being in this flick, i said ""i have to watch this movie"". she's the undisputed main character, domino, a bounty hunter. her ""job"", as the ""no action"" scenes would teach us, reflects her rebel, violent attitude to life. i have to admit that it's the very first time that i watch an action movie whose most important scenes are the one in which the guns are far away from characters' hands. so, this stomped me a bit. anyway, for all the john woo's fans, there are helicopters falling down, explosions, gunfire as if it would rain, and a lovely keira that shoots with two machine guns, one per hand. the cast is absolutely brilliant. going beyond keira, which in this movie is a real tomboy, pretty much different from the lovely action figure we're used to see, mickey rourke is back, with his usual slap-throwing face and his potent body. christopher walken makes his job pretty well, as a reality show producer.  let's go to the contents: this movie has a journalistic shape. the talk show scene is ""disgustingly"" real. anyone that watched that load of . . . you-know-what, can tell that this is the air that you breath in those situations. as well as the producer, when domino's mom says that the reality that should show domino's life is ""trash; no offense"", he answers ""i don't take it like an offense"". this movie portrays a difficult life. domino, coming from a world that didn't want her, ed (mickey rourke), a bounty hunter ""not so bounty"", choco (the third guy of the band), which family is (using ed's words), ""the correctional institutes he's been"", and alf, the driver/bomber coming from afghanistan during the russian occupation. this bunch of people represents in some way the humankind born ""without the shirt""; unlucky, violent, and with nothing to lose, excepts their (as they would consider) miserable lives. the intro of the movie says that it is ""inspired by true story . . . more or less"", so i couldn't possibly tell you how much of this stuff is true. anyway, going beyond explosions and dozens of weapons (which could have been ""added"" to make the film easier to see, and be classified as an action movie), the characters' story is too realistic to be ""edulcorated"".   the interaction between the characters is various, well studied, and definitely not boring. what hasn't convinced me so much is the role of the psychiatrist (lucy liu, sober as never in her acting career). it represents only the reason by which domino starts telling her story (and that's a story). probably, the only ""con"", in a movie with a lot of ""pros"".   all in all: this isn't ""swat"". the characters are crafted; they have an identity, a shape. they have a name and a surname (not just ""gamble"" and ""street""). it's the case to say, it's the biography of a girl whose life went as fast as a bullet.",1

"having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons, i believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its reference.  though the themes are crusty and stale to today's viewers, it is by no means a crumby waste of time.  though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse, the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no dough.  as noted by another reviewer, it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy, sit back and loaf idly through the film.  i think this short-bread of a film should be enjoyed as an appetizer for the title reference and the viewer should relax and roll with it.",1
"there are two kinds of characters on the shield: people who try to do the best they can and do the right thing, and people who relentlessly pursue their own self interest and commit every mortal sin they can while telling themselves and everyone else that they are heroes, and everyone's only hope. more than any other show, the shield is about hypocrisy and self-delusion. unfortunately, the hypocrites and self-deluders are the shows heroes, and as such have the typical genre-fiction heroes' improbable immunity to getting defeated or caught and they come out on top over and over again, making fools out of all of their peers.  the show boasts excellent camera-work. the lead ins and the fade outs are always superb. it really is a work of art to see. unfortunately the story is a cartoony, overwrought wish fulfillment scenario of gratuitous violence, rape, and lies.  the hero, who drags everyone down with him in failed scheme after failed scheme, is wiley like a warner bros cartoon character, always escaping and making fun of all the elmer fudds (anyone who does not support him in his lies and crimes), automatically attracting any good looking woman supporting character to come on the show, always surviving any attempt to bring him to justice, and always scraping your ears with his excruciating self justifications. if another cop detects something wrong with something he's doing, and someone gets hurt because of his actions, he always blames the suspicious cop, regardless of the fact that his schemes and elaborate lies and doomed plans are always the cause. every time.  like 24, this show relies on contrivances and innumerable delays to drag its story out for season after season. boring, unbelievable long term stories are injected into the storyline every season to provide a skeleton on which to hang the bloody, perverted chunks of meat that are the characters' corrupt acts and the inevitable cover-ups.  most disappointing though, is the writers' hubris as they try to change the viewers' sympathies back and forth, to and away form the characters on whims. sometimes, they want us to see shane as the enemy. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor misunderstood soul. sometimes they want us to see vic as a dangerous, sexual dynamo. sometimes they want us to see him as a poor guy with a heart of gold. sometimes they want us to see mara as a low down vile jezebel. then they think that if they show her sitting and talking over her dreams with shane, that we will find her to be sympathetic and tragic.  none of this manipulation is adequate to obtain the kinds of sympathies they want. once they've shown these characters ruin other people's lives for their own ends, that's it. it is nonsense to keep trying to flip back and forth. but then, it is also nonsense to produce seven seasons of these bumbling clowns drawing every super model in existence to their beds and running a crime syndicate right out of the police station, right under everyone's noses.",0

"i am normally not compelled to write a review for a film, but the only commentary for this film thus far on is rather unfair, so i feel it necessary to share my point of view.  ""krisana"" (or as it was titled at the theater i saw it, ""fallen"") follows matiss, a lonely latvian archivist, as he tries to learn about a woman whom he didn't try to stop from jumping off a bridge, as well as her reasons for doing so. that's the plot in a nutshell, but this film is not concerned with story as much it is in depicting the guilt of a man who failed to act. as a detective who investigates the incident tells him, we usually don't bother to care about the anonymous faces we pass every day until after they die.  comparisons to michaelango antonioni and his ""blowup"" will most likely abound in any review you read about ""krisana."" the influence of antonioni's philosophical and austere style and the story of ""blowup"" are clear and, in fact, writer/director fred kelemen makes an obvious reference to that film in scenes in which matiss attempts to come to know the woman who jumped off the bridge, or at least who he thinks did.  the only other person to share his or her views on the film detracts the ""college film class"" look and sound of the film. he or she neglects to consider the budgetary constraints that an existentialist latvian film most likely faces, but the atmospheric black and white cinematography and ambient sound succeeds at an artistic level to depict the solitude of matiss. the background sound of wind and street noises lend an ominous aura and reminds one of a fellini film, whether or not that was kelemen's intention. the filmmakers undoubtedly had little money, but this constraint is used to the film's advantage.  ""krisana"" succeeds as a character study with enough humor thrown in to keep it from being too self-serious. it could have easily fell into the trappings of a mystery story, but it avoids that and becomes an intelligent film about loneliness and guilt. if you are more concerned with plot, this film and its ending may frustrate you. otherwise, take the time to be engaged by it. it is well-worth seeking out.",1
"the first hour of the movie was boring as hell. there is no suspense, no action, not even a plot. the movie went no where. i mean they could have made the movie in 15 min short film. overall, the movie wasn't good at all, and i don't recommend it.",0

"there are very few performers today who can keep me captivated throughout an entire film just by their presence. one of those few is judy davis, who has built a successful career out of creating characters that are headstrong in attitude but very vulnerable at heart. she takes roles that most other performers would treat melodramatically and adds a fiery, deeply emotional intensity that pulls attention away from everything else on the screen.  her skills are well displayed in ""high tide,"" a film that matches her up a second time with director gillian armstrong, who gave davis her first major success with ""my brilliant career."" in that film, davis played a young woman who was determined to make it in the world, despite the suffocation she felt from her community and upbringing. in ""high tide,"" however, davis' character, lillie, is roughly the opposite: she gave up on any hope for her future when she was young, and, after giving birth to a child, runs from her responsibilities and takes up a life without direction or meaning. when she finally meets up with her daughter years later, the thought of taking care of her child is petrifying; she knows this is her chance to atone for her failures, but how can she be honest with her daughter and still gain her respect?  gillian armstrong's films usually relate stories about characters who desperately want to communicate with each other, but face obstacles set up by their own personal habits and addictions. ""oscar and lucinda,"" for instance, was about a man and a woman who desperately needed each other's love but were always blindsided by their craving for chance, represented by their gambling addictions. here, we are immersed in the world of a family torn apart by the mother's inability to commit to a settled life and her struggles to redeem herself despite being fully convinced that it's too late to change for the better. this is not simply a film with a great performance at its center, but also a rare achievement: a fully convincing story of redemption.",1
"first of all, do not call this a remake of the '63 film. even though this version is truer to the stage play, it is extremely long. the casting was good with some exceptions. chyna phillips was not a good casting choice. she was almost 30 when she did this film, and it was hard to believe she was a teenager. jason alexander was good choice, but after a while he gave me a headache. tyne daly overdoes her part as mae peterson. george wendt was funny as harry mcaffee, and showed he could even hold a tune. like the '63 film, they casted an unknown to play conrad birdie. marc kudisch had fun with his role as birdie and it showed. i even have the soundtrack and i love listening to his singing. so what made this a tv ratings flop? it was lengthy for one. they put in new songs and scenes. even though some of the new songs were good (like ""let's settle down""), was it really necessary? now don't get me wrong, i liked it, but i rather watch the '63 film (see my review). this was just a case of some actors overdoing roles, making some changes, and once again, length. one more thing i forgot to mention is vanessa williams. she does a good job with the role and the music. give her any lyrics and she could sing them. so here is my advice coming from someone who's done a couple productions of bye bye birdie: if you want to watch an entertaining take on the play, watch the '63 film. if you want to watch a version that is truer to the play, watch the '95 version. just take it in moderation though. don't be a hero and try watch it all in one sitting.",1
"this film is terrible. the story concerns a woman trying to find out what has happened to her sister. the film struggles with its identity, lurching from noir/thriller to erotic, with elements of horror thrown in for good measure. the film has a very confused structure, for example with frequent use of flashbacks without tying these into the story. the plot is poorly developed, and the characterisation made it difficult to distinguish between who was who and the part they were playing. some implausibilities exist in many films, but the scene where the main protagonist willingly accompanies a virtual stranger to his home, then agrees to go upstairs alone (to where he says she will find a phone), minus the gun she had brought with her, to call the police, was too hard to believe. some of the cinematography is very poor: we were watching on a 42"" tv so how anyone with a smaller set could work out what was happening in the scenes taken in almost complete darkness is beyond me. overall, a chaotic mess.",0

"this flick is sterling example of the state of erotic b-movies: bad porn movies without the hardcore sex. the plot in this one isn't so bad as these things go; it involves a female lawyer trying to prove her lover is innocent of killing his wife. the rest of the movie, however, leaves something to be desired. bad acting, bad direction, bad looking woman, bad sets, bad cinematography, bad sound and bad sex scenes. the filmmakers should learn the difference between raunchy and erotic. they don't even have the common sense to have gabriella hall naked or in a love scene.   how dumb is that?",1
"seeing this movie was the most fun i've had at the cinema in a long time. however, i am not able to say whether this is a good or a bad film, because such simple qualifications simply cannot be applied. this picture has everything any movie could ever have. it has characteristics of a romantic comedy, a political commentary, a thriller, a drama, an action movie, a musical, and an absurdist self-conscious art film. it's all in there, adding up to a myth.  the basic premise is about an indian couple, nandini (karishma kapoor) and shekhar (sanjay kapoor), happily living in canada, who rush to india to visit the husband's parents after a disturbing news report. the rest of the story takes place in india, where the couple find themselves in the midst of a plot of fratricidal violence. at one point, the story borrows from ""not without my baby,"" but to call shakti a remake of anything would be an injustice.  the ostensible story line takes a backseat to a number of astonishing interruptions, including shah rukh khan's dream of aishwarya rai which comes as if out of another movie. in fact, the two stars are on all the posters, but they appear really late in the film, and only shah rukh ends up being a real character. yet he makes up for it with a spirited and truly unexpected performance.  karishma kapoor is the one with most work to do in this film, and she does an admirable job, having to link up the film's twists and turns with a show of believable emotion. another notable presence is nana patekar, who plays narsimha, the tyrannical father of the husband shekhar. nana patekar dominates every scene he's in with a scary but nuanced character.  the movie is not without its share of realism. violence is rampant, but truly disturbing in the abuse received by most of the female characters, with karishma getting soundly beaten on a number of occasions. at times, this violence is clearly disturbing but ultimately it becomes surreal as every dramatic sequence is usually followed by such comic and spectacular turns that the overall effect is nothing but cathartic.  i have seen a share of bollywood releases, and the mixing of genres and incredible plot resolutions are certainly their norm. but ""shakti"" raises the bar by absorbing an even greater masala without becoming ridiculous. it is a film that achieves the grandeur of a shakespearian tragedy, where the audience of the rabble and royalty is equally entertained. it is pure, gratuitous cinema, and the director krishna vamsi must have had a dream of a good time by throwing in every trick in the book. perhaps, the all-important message of violence begetting violence and the inspiring extents of motherly love were not the thoughts on my mind, but i came out of watching ""shakti"" exhilarated. making movies can be the most fun in the world!",1
"saw this a couple times on the sundance channel several years ago and received a nice cinematic jolt to the system. a semi-surreal yet hard edged take on modern media culture (or the lack of it), focusing on some seriously wacked, way-beyond-the-hollywood-fringe dwellers. it had an amusing early performance from mark ruffalo, and some memorable cinematography from the dp who did the polish brothers movies. there was a savage umcompromising humor and a weirdly original feel to it that definitely set it apart. this film had cult classic written all over it, and i'm surprised it's not yet out on dvd.   hopefully soon.",1
"while most of the movie is very amateurish, the kosher slaughter scene is played up, but not untrue. kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin. the kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the peta film showing a kosher slaughter, in which the animals throat is cut, and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. we must remember that history is written by the victors. is one even allowed to even think that maybe the nazis were right??  doesn't it say anything that the nazis had outlawed this vicious religious slaughter, and the jews are still practicing it even today?",0
"a terrible film which is supposed to be an independent one. it needed some dependence on something.  this totally miserable film deals with the interactions among irish people. were they trying to imitate the wonderful film ""crash?"" if so, this film crashed entirely.  there is just too much going on here culminated by a little brat running around and throwing rocks into buses and cars which obviously cause mayhem.  the film is just too choppy to work. one woman loses her husband after 14 years to another while her younger sister is ripped off by a suitor. this causes the former sister to become a bitter vetch and walk around in clothes not worth believing. the older sister also becomes embittered but soon finds romance.  then, we have 3 losers who purchase masks to rob a bank. obviously, the robbery goes awry but there doesn't seem to be any punishment for the crooks. perhaps, the punishment should have been on the writers for failure to create a cohesive film.",0
"i bought this from blockbuster for 99p. the guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sh*t, but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a p*ss poor effort that sucked harder than paris hilton in a hotel room home video. talking of home videos, since when has it been fair game to release them as films - i mean to say, films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on - not any more - just gather your friends and lame-o ideas together for the weekend, lavish the production with an £8.00 budget, and get someone to fall down the stairs with a casio keyboard (the soundtrack) - then slap it on the shelves, for some poor sap (me), to take home in lonely desperation. but here's the clincher - i fast forwarded through most of this, and tossed it to one side, ready for the hammers... until the next night, while watching a darren day horror 'hellbreed' (£1.99 to take home and keep from a different blockbuster). now this film made 'grim weekend' look like the exorcist, so i slapped grim weekend back on, to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful imdb boards, that viewers claimed were hilarious. sure enough, once i had got over the misery, the pain, and the horror, of realising grim weekend was utter chod on toast, i could enjoy, savour, and downright get down to the funny stuff. and there's a lot of it. check the boards. then check the flick. hell, it might even be worth it. awwwww crap!",0
"brilliant over-acting by lesley ann warren. best dramatic hobo lady i have ever seen, and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none. the corn on face is a classic, as good as anything in blazing saddles. the take on lawyers is also superb. after being accused of being a turncoat, selling out his boss, and being dishonest the lawyer of pepto bolt shrugs indifferently ""i'm a lawyer"" he says. three funny words. jeffrey tambor, a favorite from the later larry sanders show, is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto. his character is more malevolent than usual. the hospital scene, and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site, are all-time classics. look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting (one bleeds). this movie gets better each time i see it (which is quite often).",1
"i'd completely forgotten about this film until now. this was the most blatant and worst attempt to demonise a hobby that i have ever seen. it's message seemed to be : ""don't teenagers use their imagination; they might take games seriously, go mad and hurt people."" i can only guess that the unimaginative writers of this piece thought that d&d style games are form of evil ritual or arcane worship.",0
"i heard tell that madonna was briefly considered for the catherine tremell role. compared to sharon stone, madonna is too coarse and bauerisch. she's not even close.   evil incarnate: sharon stone is a bit long in the tooth, the ameliorative effects of modern chemistry and surgery notwithstanding. however, she artfully treats us to a frightening personification of evil beyond redemption. in the obligatory sex scene, she projects pure, crystalline lust. especially her hooded, luminous eyes and a face flat with pleasure. thanks to brilliant use of lighting and other stage techniques, the harsh lines of age are only occasionally manifest. rather, she seems to have a slight golden glow (yes, yeats).   the locations gave us a view of london that is a welcome departure from the usual londonscapes .the catherine character is so powerful and menacing that i thank my lucky stars that our paths never crossed. i wouldn't have had a chance.  the original basic instinct; attempts at censorship: i must briefly comment on the original 1992 film, set in san francisco, a beautiful city worthy of this film. it is outstanding, from the music to the locations to the sets, and so on. paul verhoven pulled striking performances out of the cast and crew.   that the main baddie was a woman did not escape the scrutiny of bay area gay and lesbian activist groups. attempts at censorship were vehemently denied. swell. these philosophical pygmies demanded editorial control over the script, insisting on re-writes that would promote their political and psychiatrically driven agendas. example: sanctimoniously alleging sexism and misogyny, they demanded that the lead role be switched from bad girl to bad guy.   on locations in san francisco, the gentle, tolerant activists did their best to sabotage filming of the scenes with noise, flashing lights and other tactics. the executive producers, mario kassar and andrew vajna, vowed to fight any efforts to restrict the artistic freedom guaranteed in our democracy and obtained restraining orders against the disruptive tactics.   blowback: thanks to the fulminating activists, the film got huge national press coverage - millions of dollars worth of free advertising. their calls for viewers to boycott the film resulted in a backlash that had customers waiting in long lines wherever the film was launched. it also received widespread critical acclaim. it was, in the words of the reptilian hackett in network, ""a big- titted hit!"" sorry, gentle reader; i just couldn't resist that one. yes, it's a gibe.  in conclusion, i believe that both basic instinct 1 and 2, with their brilliant musical scores, aesthetics and acting, are works of art   that deserve protection under our constitution.",1
"as someone who has both read the novel and seen the film, i have a different take on why the film was such a flop. first, any comparisons between novel and film are purely superficial. they are two different animals.  the novel is probably intended as a satire, but it arrives as a cross between tragedy and polemic instead. any comedic elements such as those which later formed the stylistic basis of the film version are merely incidental to the author's uniformly cynical thrust. and lest the omnipresent white suit of the author fool you into thinking this is another mark twain, think again. a more apt literary precedent would be the spectre of ambrose bierce in a top hat and tails. tom wolfe is equal parts clown and hack, more celebrity than author, always looking for new grist for his self-absorbed mill.   it is therefore no wonder that the excellent production skills and direction lavished on the making of the film were doomed from the start. unlike true satire, which translates very well into film, polemics are grounded not in universally accessible observations on some form or other of human behavior, but in a single-minded attack on specific people -- whether real or fictional straw men -- who have somehow earned the wrath of the writer. any effort to create a successful filmed story or narrative from such a beginning must have a clean start, free of the writer's influence or interference.  having said that, i too find fault with the casting. it is not merely that incompetents like bruce willis and melanie griffith fail to measure up, but that real talents like tom hanks, f. murray abraham, and morgan freeman are either totally wasted or given roles that are mere caricatures.  there is enough topical material here for a truly great film satire, but it fails to come even close.",0
"i thought this was a wonderful movie. it touches every fiber of a human being. the love in the film is very intense. i thought it was will's best performance to date. great directing. liked the editing. music was great. good use of flashback. this is the kind of movie everyone should go see. i hope people will get something wonderful from this. overall, excellent movie. i think hollywood should make more movies with substance. even action films can have a caring story. i like the fact that will was very subtle in his acting. he had a purpose and a dedication that is rare to see. i would suggest watching this alone or with someone that you really care about. for me, i found that the world stopped and my only focus was on the film. the outside world was suspended for a moment. it was a nice feeling with all this chaos going on in this world. and with this me generation it was great to see something(someone) that cared about other people more than himself.",1
"this was, undoubtedly, the most disturbing movie that i have ever seen. the first part of the movie, though strange, has a light and amusing quality to it. the journey begins on such a peaceful note, detailing and emphasizing the beauty of the hills of appalachia. but that is misleading beyond belief. the obvious social problems (inbreeding) and the deformities of the countryside's inhabitants are only the first disturbing aspects of the movie. i can still hear bobby moaning in pain, and i shudder at the thought. lewis's leg made me wince. yet, while the movie was, on the whole, very disturbing and distressing, it posed some interesting questions. when is it moral, or right to take another individual's life? what can morality drive us to do, or not do, in some cases? and are dignity and moral integrity more important than life itself? whatever conclusions one may draw from the film, it is an achievement in its own right (despite certain aspects that were chillingly real and gruesome).",1

"i have to be honest and say i bought this movie, not because of the content, but because david cubitt is in it; i know ... shallow, or what? - but, come on, mr cubitt is a fantastic actor to put it mildly.  i really didn't know what to expect from watching this movie, i'd read the other write up, and those on other sites but i have to say i was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go. david cubitt as theo, and colm feore as ryan are so believable as the two estranged brothers, the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death. the scene where theo finds out ryan is gay was played brilliantly, he literally walks in on a scene and tries to leave without ryan noticing - which of course he has.  the film has been very well researched and is therefore incredibly sad, moving, uplifting and a celebration of life in parts. i came away from this feeling sad at what ryan went through but also with the knowledge that he was given hope and unconditional love by the ex drug addict brother theo. i agree with the other reviewer who finds the scene where theo says he will be a father moving, and i'd go a little further to say i actually vocalised my thoughts at ryan when he cruelly says to theo 'what makes you think you can be a father' and theo says simply 'you.' theo walks away then, but that small exchange of dialogue speaks volumes to the almost self pitying aspect of ryan who is brought up sharply by the simple retort.  a brilliantly conceived movie on all counts, the acting, directing, writing etc are all so well done. i can't really find anything else to say about this movie, except to say that it is very hard dealing with the death of a loved one but this is done superbly, to the infinite degree. the respect for the subject matter and the outpouring of love (without being contrite and mawkish) speaks volumes in this rather selfish world we live in today. well done to all concerned.  not many movies bring me to tears and give me pause to think about life in general, and also to be glad for all the things i have and not be sad for the things i don't, but this movie did, it was unbelievably uplifting considering the subject matter.",1
"with no affinity towards any type of filmmaking, and a healthy appreciation of documentaries, i can honestly say i was angry at myself for bothering to sit through the entire length of ""20 dates"". i won't waste your time with the plot, you may read other reviews. i will say though that berkowitz's hyper, woody allen-style narration was extremely annoying. you either wished he'd lay off the coffee or ingest some tranquilizers. and it's potentially apparent to berkowitz himself that this film was a bad idea, as parts of it details his trials to finance the documentary. forgive me for disguising insults as compliments, but i'll give credit to berkowitz for having the skills to convince some idiot to finance this horrid piece of ****. i appreciate the boundaries & intentions of the film here, but even when regarding the standards berkowitz sets for himself, he fires off and misses on all levels. in closing, i'm sure many of these female companions were not at ease going on a date with a twitchy wanna-be filmmaker, and therefore i question the film's sense of authenticity. hey myles, i loved your film the first time i saw it... when it appeared as an episode of seinfeld or was a film directed by woody allen or kevin smith.",0
"rohinton mistry's multi-layered novel seemed impossible to adapt for the screen but the resulting movie is filled with passion, emotion, humour and pathos. the story is somewhat slow-moving but there is always something on the screen to captivate the audience. the movie perfectly catches a particular time and place with pinpoint accuracy. all of the actors are indian - few if any known to ""western"" audiences - but they are a joy to behold, especially the little girl who acts very convincingly. don't be put off by the title and plot summary - this is a movie to be seen on the big screen. we have much to learn from it.",1
"i did not set very high expectations for this movie, which left me pleasantly surprised. the story is a little strange sometimes but overall i think it has an acceptable credibility. the action scenes are rather nice and the accompanying music is used to induce a a bit of patriotic feelings common to us movies. this may not be the best movie ever but it's uncommon for sweden and i hope to see more similar ones in the future.",1
"this movie stinks! you will want back the two-plus hours it takes to get through it. sliding doors, w/ gwyenth paltrow and directed by peter howit, did what melinda & melinda tries to do much much much better. that movie was clever, witty, and well-acted. i cared about what happened to both gwyenths -- or rather the characters she played -- and the performances by supporting cast were fantastic.  where as melinda & melinda is tiresome, the dialogue is contrived and i could have cared less about any of these people -- least of all melinda. one melinda is so dysfunctional -- her first glass of wine is at 10 a.m. -- and so melodramatic she is laughable, and not in the comedic sense. the 2nd melinda is fine, but forgettable.  woody allen's previous ensemble movies worked because, i'm guessing, he spent time on the screenplay and the actors were talented. one piece of trivia for this movie is that he wrote this screenplay in two months: you can tell. and while chloe sevigny is talented -- those around her are not, not enough to be a whole presence. the movie ends up being chloe sevigny and a bunch of other people you know you've seen in other movies but can't quite remember which ones.  sad, very sad.",0

"in the white balloon and crimson gold, the two other films by jafar panahi that i've seen, the director mines surprising amounts of depth in subjects that seem, on the surface, slight. in offside, panahi's seriocomic tribute to iranian women standing up for their rights, i don't think he's as successful. not that what he's saying isn't important, of course (and it's too bad that, like pretty much every other panahi film, iranians can't see it). but, after a while, the film feels a tad flat, and it feels long even at 90 minutes. not saying i didn't like it, though. the actors are all fantastic, and the celebration at the end of the film is infectious. but it's not an important work, in my opinion.",1
"imagine that i was about to miss this great cultural event on swedish tv last night, and it was only because my girlfriend insisted on keeping the tv on (to make it easier for her to fall asleep!) that i came across it (yes i had seen an advert for it previously but of course forgotten about it and looked forward to an 'early night'...).  anyway - this must surely be a rather unusual idea - to base a film documentary on an interview made with sound only more than 30 years ago. but with animated and other documentary film material it adds up to a really good and insightful portrait of one of the 20th centuries' most appreciated literary artists - georges remy a.k.a hergé.  i for sure will read my tintin albums with a different eye after having seen this film, which makes it easier to connect the variations in style as well as content with the different periods in hergé's life (and i can tell you that i will a.s.a.p get the few that i don't have). of course my perception of the albums has changed over the more than 25 years that i have already been reading them, as has my view about what albums are my favourites, but this adds (at least) one more dimension to them.",1
"after hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat, serling continued to go about introducing viewers to 'the twilight zone' in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode. 'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' is one of the more understated episodes, focusing on an aging movie star's inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes. because of this approach, the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short story.  both the leads, ida lupino as barbara jean trent and martin balsam as her frustrated but caring agent, shine in their performances. the main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing. lupino looks identical when playing the young trent as she does when playing the middle aged trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly. fortunately, lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past. it's a situation most can sympathise with, and yet trent is far from a sympathetic character. she is a prima-donna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her, such as the disastrously withered co-star who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were. it is somewhat surprising, then, that she is rewarded with a happy ending. it is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly pre-empted in the opening moments when trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen. what is not clear at the beginning, however, is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment. as it turns out, trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for, a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can be.  'the sixteen-millimeter shrine' gets better with each viewing. the top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past, even though we can never return. except in the twilight zone.",1
"i sincerely hope that at least the first season of cosby is released on dvd someday. the episode with hilton's eccentric genius brother, george (played by the late roscoe lee browne), is classic hilarity. it reflects the classic sibling rivalry and love between brothers whose lives took different paths but both ended up happy.  mr. cosby and ms. rashad brilliantly recaptured the chemistry that they shared on the cosby show for many years and to put them in a more middle-class role shows the dimensions they can take as artists.   the roster of comedic dynamite...madeline kahn, phylicia rashad, and mr. cosby ...classic genius!",1
"what a poor image of professional police officers is displayed on the television in the watching of this alleged reality show. one can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a ""stop"" , then the ""pat down"" of the outside of one's garment, then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someone's pocket and retrieved contraband, was cut out of the scenes, because if it wasn't, the arrest in most places are going to be tossed, should they even get passed a supervisor. a report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching has the original warrant in hand. if the dispatcher is reading from a computer printout, it is good enough for an arrest, but it does not necessarily mean the warrant is still in effect. since i haven't seen a dis-claimer from cbs (i may have missed it), cbs could be in trouble.",0
"with all of the films of recent,dealing with the british monarchy,is it really time for another? answer:you bet! the young victoria is another contribution to the wave of cinema from britain dealing with the royal family. in this case,it deals with the early life of princess victoria,and events leading up to the coronation of her becoming queen of all england,as well as her romance & eventual wedding to prince albert. the film also deals with the tempestuous lives & careers of both england's queen & prince,as well as several other events that transpire (political turmoil,etc.). emily blunt plays a radiant victoria in her youth,while rupert friend is her beloved & best friend,prince albert. the rest of the cast is rounded out with the likes of miranda richardson,as the dutchess of kent,and the always welcome on screen,jim broadbent as king william,as well as a cast of others that shine on screen. jean marc vallee (c.r.a.z.y.,loser love),directs from a winning screenplay by jullian fellowes (vanity fair,gosford park,separate lies). i absolutely went out of my head over the film's visual look (by cinematographer hagen bogdansker),who gave each frame of film a painterly look (with the help of production designer,patrice vermette),as well as some tight editing (by jill bilcock & matt garner). what i also appreciated in fellowes' script is the use of a game of chess,as a metaphor for some of the film's political motivation (the characters in the film move about like the pieces on a chess board). this is smart,well written,directed,filmed,edited & acted entertainment (and enlightenment)that makes for a well spent evening at the cinema. rated pg by the mpaa for a few scenes of sensuality,some brief violence ( a little bloody,although nothing too gory),a rude outburst of language,and some on screen smoking",1
"there are two points i need to make clear right at the beginning. first of all we all know what this year's oscar's were really all about this year. it was the academy's way of showing people that they are no racist,and never have been. they wanted to clear all preconceived notions about themselves. secondly, it's kinda pointless to make remarks about the show, because really, what difference will it make? but, it's fun to write about it. this is the year i became fed-up with the oscar's! i will never watch the show again. every year they do something wrong. before crowe wins for ""gladaitor"" when they real winner should of been ralph fiennes for ""sunshine"". if you haven't seen this movie yet, watch it and you'll agree.

"this movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic.   i thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the neil gaiman novel which i am now looking to read) and colorful characters.  one of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.  original. fun. feel-good fantasy.",1
"paint by numbers story and mediocre acting saved by some authentic color - and a few moments that are really wonderful and deeply felt. it does effectively capture the delicate transition of a girl into adulthood, and deals very sensitively and inventively with the cultural conflict the main family experiences.  unfortunately this germ of a good movie is imprisoned in an aimless and extremely convoluted plot that manages to incorporate religious strife, a conflict over a road construction project, the sex life of secondary and even tertiary characters, a mysterious man who lives in the woods, a bunch of racist hooligans, at least three different carnivals, the intricacies of local church politics, and on and on and on. and all of that doesn't even include the actual central plot, which is only about the hopes, dreams, and frustrations of two girls (and their entire families) at the turning point of their lives. i was actually shocked when i realized the whole thing was supposed to take place over the course of one summer (and that so much movie got accomplished in 1.5 hours!)   ultimately the movie is melodramatic, every plot point is predictable, major life altering events happen and then are forgotten about 10 minutes later...and some of those events are extremely distasteful. most shockingly the fact that one of the characters is involved in a horrible crime (in a totally predictable ""twist"") and then is completely forgiven and the entire incident forgotten about from then on. similarly, a secondary character is introduced solely to die a couple minutes later and provide another ""twist."" it's all totally mechanical, right up to the ending that neatly ties up all the loose ends (well not all of them, just the ones the movie thinks you care about.)",0
"yes, even as a fan of shows like survivor and the apprentice, this show is pretty bad. i didn't mind the first couple of shows, but then realizing how pathetic everyone was to actually go on the show in the first place.the antics of alex and aaron giving men a bad name at the way they cheated on or dumped their choice at the first opportunity really was not a good look for the show.  ryan, you can have trista. she had the most annoying voice i've ever heard on television, and she definitely wasn't the smartest girl around (very media savvy, but i doubt there's much more there).  i haven't really watched any of the shows since, apart from the occastional re-run on daytime tv. i think the point of reality tv is to treat it as ""entertaining trash"". view it as something you can laugh over, and don't have to think too hard about ( i don't watch csi its like reality tv-tired and clichéd, but you have to think too much anyway while watching).  a couple of thoughts on some reasons fro going on the show. at the very first 'the woman tell all"" woman such as amy ( who had a lot of class about her) commented that she had tried every scene aka the bar and club scene to meet a guy and it wasn't happening for her. hey amy, how about joining a club? getting a hobby? doing charity work? changing your job to one where you meet more guys? gees, all i know is that going to a bar is not the ideal place to meet a future partner.  amy and many of the other girls seemed to be obsessed with the idea of meeting ""the perfect man'. clue to ladies: he doesn't exist. there are, however, many great guys out there that would make great husbands, some who may be right for you! they may not earn six figures a year or be a jfk junior look alike, but they are great guys all the same. the shallowness of woman on this show is quite unbelievable. im still a youngster, at was lead to believe that woman gradually grew out of their shallowness as they got older and more realistic about their future partner. this show is proving otherwise.  overall this show does a lot to confirm many stereotypes of how woman view men in society. it really is a terrible show and i think all of these types of shows should just stop being made. the best dating shows by a country mile are blind date and the fifth wheel because they are fun. nothing is manned more between the ""couples"" than a simple night out. the bachelor, sadly takes itself way too seriously.",0

"i'm not a stage purist. a movie could have been made of this play, and it would almost necessarily require changes... comme ci, comme ca. but the modest conceits of this material are lost or misunderstood by the movie's creators who are in full-on ""shallow blockbuster"" mode. it would be hard to imagine a worse director. perhaps only josh logan & jack warner could have ruined this in the same way attenborough did.  onstage a chorus line was a triumph of workshopping as a production method. dancers answering a casting call found themselves sitting around shooting the crap about their stage-career experiences (very 70s!). then bennett and hamlisch took some time, handed them a song and cast them as themselves. ...astonishing! unbelievably modern. the 'story'of acl is (in turn) about answering a casting call for a play we never have a complete view of, because the play doesn't matter. it was meta before the idea was invented, 25 years before adaptation noodled with a similar idea. acl was also another in a reductivist trend that is still alive, & which is a hallmark of modern creativity: that technique itself is compelling... that there's more drama in an average person's life than you could ever synthesize with invented characters. what a gracious idea. the stage play had one performance area (an empty stage) and three different ways to alter the backdrop, to alleviate visual tedium, not to keep viewers distracted. the space recedes and the actors stories are spotlighted. it worked just fine. that was the point. all these ideas are trampled or bastardized. set-wise, there wasn't one, and no costumes either until the the dancers came out for their final bows, in which the exhilarating ""one"" is finally, powerfully, performed in full (gold) top hats and tails, with moves we recognize because we've watched them in practice sessions. the pent-up anxiety of the play is released --- and audiences went nuts.   after grampa manhandles this, it's like a mushed, strangled bird. he clearly has the earlier, respected all that jazz (and fosse's stage piece dancin') in mind as he makes his choices. hamlisch's score was edgy & interesting for it's time, but time has not been kind to it. it's as schmaltzy as ""jazz hands."" and that's before attenborough ever touches it. he's remarkable at finding whatever good was left, and mangling it.   a simple question might have helped attenborough while filming this, ""could i bear spending even a few minutes with people like these?"" a major issue for any adaptation of the play is how the 4th wall of theater (pivotal by it's absence in theater) would be addressed in the film format. there's never been a more ""frontal"" play. the answer they came up with was, ""i'm sorry.. what was the question?"" the cast has been augmented from a manageable number of unique narratives, to a crowd suffocating each other and the audience, and blending their grating selves together. i was well past my annoyance threshold when that annoying little runt swings across the stage on a rope, clowning at the (absent) audience. the play made you understand theater people. this movie just makes you want to choke them.  perhaps broadways annoying trend of characters walking directly to stage center and singing their stories at the audience (les miz, miss saigon) instead of relating to other characters started here. but the worst imaginable revival of the play will make you feel more alive than this movie.   a chorus line is pure schlock.",0
"this low budget digital video film has strengths in the right places--writing and acting. in addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far. in low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but, surprising, it rivals film stock for brightness, clarity, and, saturation in brightly lit situations. this is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a ""midnight cowboy"" kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban san francisco.",1
"this movie is ridiculous! that's exactly what i like about this piece of ""guilty pleasure"". it is easy to condemn this movie for not including pat priest and butch patrick, the original marilyn and eddie. but look at the year and do the math. pat priest and butch patrick had long outgrown their parts! time does that to young stars. yvonne de carlo, who re-prised her role as lili, was pushing the big 6-0 (even though she still looked good and was still the perfect ""lili"").  it's a shame that yvonne de carlo wasn't given a larger part. still, it was good to see fred gwynne and al lewis in the roles that made them so famous! during the 2 seasons that the munsters was on prime time, it was the gwynne/lewis chemistry that made the series such a success. the rest of the cast were supporting cast members, not to say that they weren't needed. they were! the tv series wouldn't had survived as long as it did without them. given the choice between butch patrick or happy derman (the original ""eddie""), the choice was too easy. yvonne de carlo was also the better choice over joan marshall.  though this movie doesn't measure up to the original tv series, it still measures up nicely and is one of the better ""reunuin"" tv specials that plagued the boob-tube during the late 1970s/early 1980s.

"please take a minute to read my entire review. i am not knocking the film itself - only the dvd versions currently available.  ***  i really wanted to give this film even two stars. i mean how could it possibly rank a mere 1 out of 10!?!  here's how: an epic film adaptation of tolstoy's novel ""war and peace"" with historically accurate battle scenes, courtesy of the red army, and an extremely faithful, scene-for-scene adaptation of the novel would be difficult but worth sitting through for seven hours - if that's what you were seeing.  the trouble is you can't see that film - anywhere as far as i know.  i am attempting to watch the ruscico dvd version - widely considered the best version available since it's letter boxed and restores the scenes that were cut from other dvd releases.   but, it is one of the worst film prints i've ever seen transfered to dvd. the picture is muddy and inconsistent, often strobing. it's almost tolerable if you crank your brightness, color and picture levels up to maximum.... but the problem doesn't end there.  the sound is also way inconsistent, blaringly loud in parts, virtually inaudible in others.   and as for languages, it's a huge problem for english speakers - the dubbed option has some good actors, and some really terrible ones whose performance grates, and parts of the film just aren't dubbed at all, slipping back into russian and even french randomly.  the subtitled option isn't much better. the subtitles don't appear below the image, but right over it - obscuring some of the beauty (or what's left of it) in the scenery. furthermore, the subtitles are often a poor translation (a shame given that the script took pains to hew so close to tolstoy's actual words), and the subtitles too seem to just drop out in parts.   so, even if you max out the color, brightness and picture settings, and turn the volume way up, and choose subtitled *and* english dubbed, you're still going to get a film that's annoying to watch and listen to.  can it's content overcome that? it might have been able to, but at seven hours - who can stand it for that long?  maybe someday, someone will come along and restore this - and maybe then i will see a masterpiece - but for now, i just can't give more than one star to something i've only been able to stand watching about the first 12% of.",0
"i didn't know what to except so i think it was a lot better not having excepted much. don't get my wrong its not a bad short film. tess nanavati is a relatively new directer and writer so i think she deserves a lot of kudos for making this film. you can tell that it has been an act of love for her. the acting (outside of dominic) is a little cheesy and the quality of film is not great either but for a really low budget film its good. there was times when the story line gets convoluted and there are parts that drag on, though i don't feel it greatly detracts for one's ability to understand the film. if you love dominic monaghan as much as i do, i say go for it. the gag reel was fun, i won't spoil it but there is a particular scene that makes buying the dvd worth it just so you can watch it over and over. if you like the film then check out the pink mirror, a film also done by jagged edge. i know fans of dominic will enjoy this little piece of heaven.",1
"i believe in keeping religion out of government and out of the movies. when i want a sermon, i'll go to church, but i don't want one from a movie. i don't mind some supernatural themes, (after all, religion is about as supernatural as you can get!) but this movie had so much preaching in it that i was really annoyed. the landlady reminded me of witches that of seen in other movies. the bad guy even looked like he had horns.   and what a silly ending: the hero went into the meeting and yelled at all of those old men, and that broke the spell. if only life were that simple. i think that when movies are that stupid, they ought to be distributed with a warning: danger! preaching contained herein!",0
the film gets my stamp of approval. the scene in the museum demands acting without dialogue. this is one of the most interesting and unique scenes in the history of film. dickinson's character kate is very well developed and her performance is felt throughout the entire film. the best work angie dickinson did since point blank!,1
"admittedly, i know nothing about baseball, i'm not even a fan of the sport, but that didn't stop me enjoying the farrelly brothers' latest film, fever pitch, a charmingly irreverent romantic comedy. the film is not really about baseball; rather, it's really about relationships, and the emotional disconnectedness that can often take place.  jimmy fallen  giving his best performance to date  stars as ben, a dorky, lightly nerdy schoolteacher. ben is a kind of man-boy, who unfortunately has never really grown up, and he fosters an almost fanatical addiction to the red sox baseball team. ben has devoted his life to the sox, and does everything from making the pilgrimage to florida for spring training to decorating every square inch of his apartment in team paraphernalia.  one day, while taking his honors geometry class to on a field trip to her office, ben meets the go-getting lindsey (a wonderful drew barrymore). lindsey is a corporate, career orientated kind of girl, but she has a kind of cuteness that ben finds totally endearing. he's initially hesitant to ask her out, thinking that she's way out of his ""class,"" and, lindsey doesn't immediately see a potential partner in ben.  their first date gets off to a disastrous start when lindsey is stricken with a severe case of food poisoning  and her resonant retching provides the first clue that we are, in fact, watching a farrelly brothers movie. rather than accept lindsey's - rather urgent - request to reschedule, ben sticks around to play nurse, orderly, and janitor. so ben scrubs the toilet and the dog's teeth, while his love interest is passed out with a bucket next to her bed.  when lindsey wakes up in the morning and finds him asleep on her couch, she begins the long, fitful process of dismantling the web of status anxiety and ambition she has come to think of as her standards. soon they are falling in love, with lindsey blithely accepting ben's fanatical devotion to his sport.  having inherited choice season tickets from his beloved uncle, ben has organized his life around the season  he's never missed a game. but their relationship, which has progressed without a hitch throughout the winter, hits a snag at the start of the season.  lindsey wants ben to do other things, like holiday with her parents and party with her friends, but ben begins to have trouble modulating his interest to meet lindsey halfway. can lindsey consent to his irrational devotion to the boys of summer in order to make their relationship work? can she really accommodate ben's infatuation with sports? can a die-hard and nerdy red sox fan find true love after all? of course, lindsey and ben come with a colorful assortment of opinion-wielding friends. lindsey's strictest buddy, the skinny, rich and blond robin (kadee strickland), insists that there must be something wrong with the guy if he's still single at 30. however, plump, curly-haired sarah (marissa jaret winokur) and molly (ione skye) supply a more optimistic and positive view of ben.  ben's eccentricity could be applied to virtually any obsessive sports fan, while lindsay's frustrations could be representative of any upwardly mobile career driven woman. fallon is terrific as ben, exhibiting real big screen potential, overcoming the not-insignificant challenge of keeping ben from being unsympathetic. barrymore, meanwhile, is equally charming as the workaholic lindsey, particularly as she struggles to accept ben for who he is without losing sight of her own needs.  fever pitch really works, and even though there are lots of inspired comedic moments, the movie is also addressing the serious problem of sports addiction and how difficult it can be for couples to negotiate this fragile territory.  much of the movie was filmed at boston's fenway park, which adds a fine sense of authenticity to the proceedings, as well as the ambiance of the games, though fully appreciating what transpired with the team will probably be limited to baseball aficionados. even so, fever pitch is blessed with such a finely wrought and intelligently funny script that even novice baseball fans will find much with which to connect. mike leonard september 05.",1
"richard dreyfus is not the star here. he has about three 20 second cameos and what is gene barry doing all over this movie? no idea, the director was probably his brother! this is a movie that makes no sense whatsoever. the inept writer/director (same dude) butchered up everyone's talent with his horrendous uh...work. i got the dvd for a penny so can't complain! but it's weird!and it makes you feel weirded out and in not a good way. this was the 70's and looks like the director was on a bad acid trip and wanted everyone to experience what it's like to be inside his head. it has a somewhat interesting and controversial concept, but like a scratched record, it quickly plays foul. it has that ""manson family on acid"" vibe to it.  i have no idea how the other reviewer got all they did out of this movie? maybe they worked in it back when? at any rate, be prepared to lose 80+ min of your life you'll never get back. yes, it's that awful!",0
"i took my 19 year old daughter with me to see this interesting exercise in movie making. i always find it intriguing to get views and opinions from a different generation on movies, especially as i'm such a cynic myself. it's good to get an unjaded opinion from someone who hasn't yet reached the ""been there, done that"" approach to every movie she sees. i'm pleased to say that we both really enjoyed it and regarded it as a successful mother / daughter evening out. far, far better than going to see some brain dead ""chick flick"", which i gather is what we are supposed to enjoy, according to the demographics?   eighteen directors were asked to produce a short piece about each of the arrondissements of paris, a city i haven't visited in 20 years. but i wish i had. they are loosely linked by joining shots, and represent different approaches to love in the city regarded in popular culture as the quintessential romantic capital of the world. some of the films work better than others but, as other reviewers have said, it never descends too far into kitsch. some are funny, some are sad, some intriguing and some just plain puzzling (i'm still trying to discern some deep inner truth to the ""flying tiger, hidden dragon"" hairdressing salon.) some are just fun and perhaps shouldn't be assigned too much meaning (the vampire and the tourist for example.) possibly my only criticism of the whole film, is that it makes paris look too good. it can also be cold, wet, foggy, indifferent and miserable, or, in summer, baking hot and packed with so many tourists that you feel like a sardine in a can queuing up for hours to see every attraction. but i'm nit picking.   my personal favourite by far was the coen brothers film shot on the tuileries metro station, and starring a perfectly cast steve buscemi as a confused tourist who inadvertently finds himself caught up in a lovers' tiff. absolutely perfect, and very, very funny, without buscemi having to say a word. i also perversely enjoyed the piece about the two mime artists, which was probably the closest the movie got to being cutesy - that certainly teetered on the edge of kitsch, but it just stayed on the right side. rufus sewell and emily mortimer gaining insight from an encounter with oscar wilde's tomb left me pretty indifferent, and juliette binoche trying to cope with the death of her small son made me very, very uncomfortable. i thought both the bob hoskins / fanny ardent piece, and ben gazzara / gena rowlands fell a bit flat, but maggie gyllenhaal was good (has she cornered the market in junkies? i watched sherry baby last week.)   but i felt the two ""social justice"" pieces (for want of a better way of putting it), worked very well. by that, i mean first of all the film about the young mother leaving her own child in a day care to go and look after someone else's baby across town. and then the film about the african migrant, struggling to exist on the margins of an indifferent society, who is stabbed and dies in the street in front of a young, new paramedic. yet another murder statistic, in a world which sees thousands of migrants dying in the struggle to reach what they see as a better life, every year. i thought both pieces very well observed.  the final film, 14th arrondissement, in which margo martindale plays a postal worker from colorado recounting the story of her first trip to paris  in very badly accented french  to her night school french class, moved me. a perfect ending, to a good, intriguing if not quite great, movie.   paris je t'aime was an ambitious idea, but it works pretty well.",1

"now, i haven't read the original short story to know all the literary points that went wrong here, so i'm not going to go down that path here.  but i have some time ago learnt that stephen king movies simply -are not- horror films, with perhaps a couple of exceptions. this was not one of them. it started well enough, and for once i'm not going to complain about the acting, although fred gwynne was as usual wonderful.. also i will forgive the total lack of parenting skills, as they were necessary to make the story here move forward...  but there was one consistent point that i couldn't help but get annoyed with. and that came pretty close to the end of the movie, and at least 2 characters partook in the activity of dumb stupidity. the moments i refer to are thus: there is a tiny zombie running around the house. you suspect it is under the bed. do you   (a) get as close to the bed as you can before blindly raising the duvet cover up, exposing pretty much your whole body to whatever damage such a teeny undead cannibal might inflict on you, or   (b) move a little away from the bed so you can peer under the completely open end from a position of slightly increased safety, or at least see the mini terror coming at you, giving you a little reaction time.  i know, let's go with (a). i feel like offering myself up for the slaughter today. bleh  fun enough film though... just not very scary.",0

"""rois et reine"" is a sprawling mess of a movie which will probably irritate as many viewers as it delights. it focuses by turns on ex-lovers nora (emanuelle devos)and ismael (mathieu amalric) as they each confront a major crisis in their now separate lives. while nora's story is played straight and is sombre in tone, ismael's is played mainly for laughs, although it's not particularly funny. nora's crisis is triggered by the terminal illness of her father louis (maurice garrel), and ismael's by his sudden incarceration in a mental hospital at the instigation of a mysterious third party. ismael and louis are just two of the males who have shaped nora's life, and in turn have been shaped by her, the most notable others being her now deceased first lover pierre and their young son elias. as events past and present are played out for the audience, and the ex-lovers become involved in each other's lives once more, it gradually emerges that nora's personal take on her life story may be less reliable than first meets the eye.  cult director arnaud desplechin has fashioned a considerable oddity here, one which has garnered major plaudits in france. he wilfully eschews established narrative convention and develops the movie via a series of dramatic shifts in mood and tone. had this approach been founded on a coherent unifying core idea or theme it might have worked, but it's not clear in the end what exactly desplechin's film is actually about. heavy-handed allusions to greek mythology and freudian theory are evidently freighted with meaning but, at least for this unschooled movie-goer, remain less than helpful in illuminating and interpreting the lives of the characters. at other times the treatment lapses into kitsch but the use of the anodyne ""moon river"" as the film's theme tune suggests this is probably deliberate.  **spoiler alert** i suspect a major theme of the movie is the not very original observation that how we see ourselves can differ radically from how others see us or even how we think others see us. this idea is most obviously represented in the film by the violent death of pierre and the revelation contained in louis' secret diary, but unfortunately both events seem entirely disconnected from what has otherwise been revealed to the audience of pierre and louis' respective relationships with nora. this seems a cheat on desplechin's part, as if he is thrusting the idea upon us in unmediated form rather than illustrating it more subtly in the natural course of the narrative. one or two darkly surreal touches imply the presence of an alternative but largely unconscious world of persons stripped frighteningly bare, but again these are felt more as pretentious intrusions of film-making technique rather than eruptions from a deeper reservoir of truth inherent in the story. in fact, for all its heavy-handed hints at depth, the characters are curiously undeveloped and unnuanced, as if they function more as ciphers for their creator's many ideas about people rather than as real people in their own right. much of the detail of their lives seems arbitrarily applied rather than organic. for example, ismael, as we are constantly reminded, is a viola player, but more than two hours pass before we actually see or hear him play, and the effect of his chosen instrument or profession upon his personality is never elaborated. hence, he may just as well be a marine biologist or a trapeze artist.   amalric brings a certain manic charm to the unhinged but ultimately sane ismael, but i found devos cloying and monotone (which may be intentional, however) as the elusive nora. meanwhile jean-paul roussillon as ismael's father, elsa wolliaston as his psychoanalyst and magalie woch as the psychically wounded but defiant sinologist he befriends in hospital make the biggest impact amongst the supporting actors. catherine deneuve's in it, too, though her role is little more than a self-referential cameo.  ultimately, ""rois et reine"" is very much an acquired taste. should it fail to push your buttons, it's very likely that desplechin's undisciplined and florid approach will frustrate and exasperate even as you somehow keep watching.",0
"this movie looked like a classic in the cheesy 80s slasher genre, which is my favorite genre of them all, so when i saw it was free on demand, i had to watch it! it stars caroline munro, from both dr. phibes films (she was his wife that died!), dracula a.d. 1972, the golden voyage of sinbad, captain kronos - vampire hunter, the spy who loved me, maniac, and faceless.  brought to you by the people behind don't open til christmas and pieces, heres my thoughts on this...  it opens on april fools day, where a bunch of kids play an elaborate prank on the school nerd- promising him sex in the shower, and giving him public humiliation and a face in the toilet (all while hes naked!). the coach puts a stop to it, but both parties swear revenge. but, the cool kids end up burning the nerd alive.  cut to the future, and its th high school reunion, or so they think (bwahahha?). the only ones with invitations were the gang who burned the kid, and its april fools day (or really, the day before april fools, but the fun starts at midnight), yet they fail to see the coincidence and hang out in front of the school until nightfall. then they finally break into the school and it starts storming.  inside they find food/drink and a little shrine for each of them, each of their lockers and belongings, along with marty's (the nerds) locker and yearbook. they also find the old black janitor/caretaker who spends his time saying ""oooh yesser! yesser! i don't want no trouble, sir!"" and then is killed instantly. pretty pointless character, but hes still my favorite.  the movie takes a page out of alien's book, in a deliciously gory way that you just have to see! thats when everyone realizes that they're there to die, and they start freaking out, except for shirley, who decides it would be best to take a bath in the old school showers at a time like this. of course, it pours out blood and acid and her face melts off (very cool, mind you) the rest of the night goes as usual, sex, drugs, and marty killing everyone whilst wearing a jester mask.. whats their plan? ""all we have to do is stay awake and wait till noon. marty wont kill us during mid-day!"". seriously, thats what he said. apparently you can only kill at nighttime. but will they survive through the night? who will live and who will die? and why are all the bodies disappearing? rent, buy, or steal this great movie to find out! the movie is actually very good, filled with clichés (car wont start, dammit!) and just plain slasher fun. not to mention they all have names like carol and nany and frank and joe and susan. i recommend it to all of you! and, not to mention, it has a spin off! 1989's cutting class is a spin-off from this slasher gem, and that movie starts the career of brad pitt and roddy mcdowell.  favorite scene: 2 people having sex, the guy wants to finish but the girl doesn't. ""talk dirty to me, frank!!"" she screams ""uh... tits!"" ""dirtier!"" ""uh... tits. f*ck. tits. boobs. f*ck."". it seems to work for her and at her climax, the killer electrocutes them both!",1

"ok here is how i do this. i grade movies on 10 components. each component will inherently start with 5 points. it can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.  mood: action, romance, comedy, drama, suspense - i give this component 10 points. it had a perfect balance of all five aspects. the action was fun and exiting. the romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. i laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still i was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.  plot - i give this component 10 points. i thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. i found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant i again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.  cinema photography - i give this component 8 points. while the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, i found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.  fx - i give this component 10 points. i love that they used c.g.i. sparingly. the epic scenes were believable. the magical powers were frighteningly realistic. all in all less is more, and this had it all! cast - i give this component 10 points. no names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! michelle pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, charlie cox made tristan come to life, claire danes gave emotion to the stars, and i will never look and robert de niro the same again.  acting - i give this component 10 points. even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. once again, i will never look and robert de niro the same again.  character development - i give this component 9 points. this felt a little rushed and i think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.  dialogue - i give this component 10 points. the dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.  score - i give this component 7 points. i can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. i am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.  ending - i give this component 9 points. almost perfect ending! i feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.  total: 93% buy the dvd? hel yes! see it in the theatre? most definitely! bottom line: excellent movie for everyone! epic! i strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, i know i'll be going back for seconds!",1

"to those who say that this movie deserves anything below the unflaunting grace that it showed, i disagree. this is an amazing documentary about a shocking day.  imdb asks us to rate this movie. i beg you to consider the fact that the documentary was made. the courage that it took to shoot this film is most notable. we find that the two brothers are split up when that moment happened. they continue to document the bravest of the brave without knowing about their own and eachother's safety. to judge whether it's nobler to shoot a video of that tragedy or to save the lives as those amazing, amazing firefighters did is not mine to answer. i just know that in 30 years, a class full of children will not know one without the other.  i submit a wholehearted 10. this is why the art of filming was created! to capture the natural emotion that real life offers. you can keep your kung-fu junk. romance is cute. action will never reach this level. this movie, 9/11, will be timeless in that it did not glorify itself. it didn't have a sneak-peek. it didn't have all of the blatant vanities that a lion's share of the many movies on the many screens blare. it had class, composure, substance, and it had a record of the day that changed the modern face of america and even the world. it spoke of things inescapable to the eye of the camera. please consider this movie, as it itself proclaims, a stirring tribute to all of those who fell because of the free, beautiful name of america.  how can you give anything less to a movie that shows, not embellishes, the natural bravery of real people acting in unreal times. i love ""the godfather"" but ""9/11"" is forever a different kind of movie as this is now a different kind of world. it is art without question or questions.  jf",1
"the biggest mystery of veronica mars is not one that she had to tackle on screen.  rather, the mystery is why this perennial ratings disappointment is still on the air. this week marked a nadir for veronica mars: it ranked 146 out of 146 shows in the big 6 (soon to be big 5). yes, you read right. veronica mars was beaten by every show of the now-defunct wb and every show on upn. it was beat by all the shows on fox and of course by all the shows on abc, cbs and nbc.  now, the hip hypesters are going to say: but this was a re-run. but everything on tv that week was pretty much a re-run! it boggles the mind why cw would choose this proved ratings disappointment as one of the few shows it saved from upn.  clearly something is going on behind the scenes. favors are being exchanged and influence peddled.  sorry to be so cynical, but what other explanation is there? the ""veronica mars has potential"" line is clearly dead now that it's had two years to establish itself and failed to do so.  maybe it's joel silver's influence and clout, but frankly, i am at a loss why anyone would choose to spend their clout on a bad show that no audience is watching.  a great mystery and a very inauspicious debut for cw.",0
"this movie is damian szifrón's second immersion in movies after his excellent character study in ""el fondo del mar"". with ""tiempo de valientes"" he creates extremely well done characters, far away from prototypes and with an unprecedented chemistry between them. i've seen szifron's talent to present every character in a lighthearted way but just enough to involve us emotionally with them. his control over them is magnificent, so he restores on the movie a great direction and an overall brilliantly polished script, the characters laugh and cry with real sentiment and invite the viewer to join them in their emotions and their evolution on screen.  the spanish takes over the english, the buenos aires urban landscape at night replaces hollywood sets and the premise is just as interesting as any other, so we have a film daring to compete over hollywood's machinery.  but i want you to see the movie mainly because i've never dealt with such endearing characters, all of them. it seems the script suits perfectly to the actors and vice versa. i really believe with a film making like this argentina is really up to the competition.",1

"i just love malle's documentaries. they are so effortless and simple but still so fascinating. i have no idea why this documentary works. it is about glencoe, minnesota. 5000 people live there and nothing happens, really. but still malle manages to make it fascinating and interesting. his love for humanity, even racist or homophobic people, is so overwhelming that you just can't help but also to fall in love with them too.   malle filmed most of it in 1979. he came back 6 years later to see what had changed. this would have been a good film without the material 6 years later but this small addition makes it great. it may sound like malle was just doing what has been done in the up series but in fact it is not. the up series are about people. malle's emphasis is not so much on what happened to each person but what has happened to this community. and the change is great. 1985 is the reagan era and the farmers are suffering. once a proud community, now no one sees much future at all and parents hope their children will educate them self and do something else than farming.   this documentary is quite relevant today. our financial crises today started because of what was happening then. just take a look to these final words in the film, spoken by an older lawyer from the town (in 1985):  ""well i have high hopes for this country because the things that are going on right now can only be characterized in my mind as an obsession with greed. and a nation doesn't live long with that obsession. and particularly a democracy that... there's good - there's good - a lot of good in this country and a lot of good people and they aren't gonna - they aren't gonna subscribe to this philosophy of greed that's going on now. it's horrible.""  unfortunately it took more than 20 years and a hell of a headache before that happened.",1
"i have just recently been through a stage where i wanted to see why it is that horror films of the 90's can't hold a candle to 70's and 80's horror films. i have been very public in this forum about the vileness of films like the haunting and urban legend and such. i feel that they (and others like them) don't know what true horror is. and it bothered me to the point where it made me go to my local video store and rent some of the classic horror films. i already own all the friday's so i rented the texas chainsaw massacre, the original nightmare on elm street, jaws, the exorcist, angel heart, the exorcist and halloween. now the other films are classics in their own right but it is here that i want to tell you about halloween. because what halloween does is perhaps something no other film in the history of horror film can do, and that is it uses subtle techniques, techniques that don't rely on blood and gore, and it uses these to scare the living daylights out of you. i was in a room by myself with the lights off and as silly as i knew it was, i wanted to look behind me to see if michael myers was there. no movie that i have seen in the last ten years has done that to me. no movie.  john carpenter took a low budget film and he scared a generation of movie goers. he showed that you don't need budgets in the 8 or 9 figures to evoke fear on an audience. because sometimes the best element of fear is not what actually happens, but what is about to happen. what was that shadow? what was that noise upstairs? he knows that these are the ways to scare someone and he uses every element of textbook horror that i think you can use. i even think he made up some of his own ideas and these should be ideas that people use today. but they don't. no one uses lighting and detail to provoke scares, they use special effects and rivers of blood. and it is just not the same. you can't be scared by a giant special effect that makes loud noises and jumps out of a wall. it's the moments when the killer is lurking, somewhere, you just don't know where, that scare you. and halloween succeeds like no other film in this endeavor.  in 1963 a young micael myers kills his sister with a large butcher knife and then spends the next 15 years of his life, silently locked up in an institute. as loomis ( his doctor) says to sheriff brackett, "" i spent eight years trying to reach him and then another seven making sure that he never gets out, because what i saw behind those eyes was pure e-vil. "" that sets up the manic and relentless idea of a killer that will stop at nothing to get what he wants. and all he wants here is to kill laurie. no one know why he wants to kill her, but he does.( halloween ii continues the story quite well )  what carpenter has done here is taken a haunting score, mendacious lighting techniques and wrote and directed a tightly paced masterpiece of horror. there is one scene that has to be described. and that is the scene where annie is on her way to pick up paul. she goes to the car and tries to open it. only then does she realize that she has left her keys in the house. she gets them, comes back out and inadvertently opens the car door without using the keys. the audience picks up on this but she doesn't. she is too busy thinking about paul. when she sits down, she notices that the windows are fogged up. she is puzzled and starts to wipe away the mist, and then myers strikes, from the back seat. this is such a great scene because it pays attention to detail. we know what is happening and annie doesn't. but it's astute observations that carpenter made that scared the hell out of movie goers in 1978 and beyond.   halloween uses blurry images of a killer standing in the background, it has shadows ominously gliding across a wall, dark rooms, creepy and haunting music, a sinister story told hauntingly by donald pleasance and a menacing, relentless killer. my advice to film makers in our day and age is to study halloween. it should be the blue print for what scary movies are all about. after all, carpenter followed in hitchcock's steps, maybe director's should follow in his.  halloween personifies everything that scares us. if you are tired of all the mindless horror films that don't know the difference between evil and cuteness, then halloween is a film that should be seen. it won't let you down. i enjoy being scared, i don't know why, but i do. but nothing has scared me in the 90's, except maybe one film ( wes craven's final nightmare ). if you enjoy beings scared, then halloween is one that you should see. and if you have already seen it a hundred times, go and watch it again, back to back with a film like urban legend. urban legend will have you enticed at all the pretty faces in the movie. halloween will have you frozen with fear, stuck in your seat, not wanting to move. now tell me, what horror film would you rather watch?  and just to follow up after seeing zombie's version, it makes you appreciate this that much more. this is a classic by definition. zombie bastardized his version, but it doesn't take away from the brilliance of this one.",1

"at least something good came out of damon runyon's misguided attempt to sentimentalize the mafia. ""guys and dolls,"" the seemingly indestructible stage musical, was captured on film in 1955 by joseph l. mankiewicz (""all about eve"") in a colorful, enjoyable movie that featured an all-star cast including vivian blaine (from the original broadway show), jean simmons (whose character bears an odd resemblance to audrey hepburn in ""roman holiday"") and two of the all-time great leading men, frank sinatra and marlon brando, both of whom had recently won oscars for best supporting actor (""from here to eternity"") and best actor (""on the waterfront"") and were on the top of their game. one listen to brando singing ""luck be a lady tonight"" speaks volumes about where the early dylan got his voice. stubby kaye steals the show as nicely nicely johnson, who brings down the house with ""sit down you're rocking the boat."" the ubiquitous sheldon leonard adds yet another page to his rogue's gallery of screen gangsters. the film has a bright, cartoonish look, anticipating the pop art of the early 1960s. the characters speak in a stylized patois, apparently based on yiddish idioms. although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are dated, it's all great fun, and even the gentle kidding of the salvation army is harmless and reflects no real animosity toward organized religion. just seeing sinatra and brando in the same film is reason enough to watch this movie, but it has lots of other attractions to offer during its 149 minutes.",1

"i rented this shortly after renting ben stein's ""expelled"" and thought it would interesting to compare them. before i go further, it seems only fair that i point out the following so a reader can see if i'm prejudiced or not. i'm trying to be objective, for the record.  i tend to enjoy maher's hbo show now and then, though i rarely think he's the source of the humor. i don't really care for his stand-up either. but he makes some good points on the show now and again, and i liked politically incorrect, though he was still fairly politically correct (which i deem a negative because the very term sounds orwellian or at least fascist). as for my religious views, i'll say for simplicity's sake that i'm a non-denom. christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed in.  that being said, this a bad ""documentary"" for reasons that haven't been touched on yet by many reviewers--though the ones mentioned are valid too. the reason it's not convincing isn't just that he argues the main point without letting others talk (and his point boils down to nothing logical either, it's just ""come on, really?"" which isn't a point, just a question. try david hume if you want a decent argument.). the reason this isn't convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter. i saw this about 2 months ago and i only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasn't a clergyman. there are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with masters or doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring, particularly in the fields of history, anthropology or a host of others.  if one compares this to ben stein's ""expelled: no intelligence allowed"" he'll find that stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors, professionals, clergy, etc. he does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds. he also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education. maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this. instead he idiotically refers to the 20th century's secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more socio-political power!!!! (it's in the bonus features where he's standing in front of the anne frank house i think.) this is a true orwellian head-trip. he blames christianity in particular on many pointless deaths--which has had its share, though far smaller than most!!--without even including a basic view of the evidence. perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanism's miserable record of the 20th century alone.  another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or ""average"" practitioner. he picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd. how difficult is that? how does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule? it does not. wow, so people in cults think outside of the norm? how enlightening to know this. great work maher! again, it would be fairly easy to interview someone like laurence vance and include his work on refuting the idea of ""patriotic duty"" that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved in.  beyond all that, he's just not that funny here. some of the clips that are overlaid in ""clever"" out of context/irreverent ways might garner a laugh, but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from maher will not be forthcoming, much less convincing. he spends most of his time bashing christians, spouting inaccuracies, and interviewing fringe groups that he doesn't allow to really answer his questions.  for the record, there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves. he touches on almost none of these. i get the feeling that i could've responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed, but the whole thing reeks of deck-stacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out.",0
"i happened upon this flick on a rainy sunday, intending to tune-in to something else. out of curiosity, i accessed the comments here, and found myself watching it to the end. i really didn't do so with intent -- this was one of those movies where you're ""fascinated,"" and watch it for ""another couple of minutes,"" until you finally just watch to the end. and the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view. the one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking ladd and spano, and their earlier roles. but great isn't anywhere to be found anywhere here - story, performances, and particularly the absurd courtroom hi-jinks. we all know that perry mason (before raymond burr passed the 300-lb. mark), and ben matlock, are granted some leeway in cavorting around the courtroom, instead of being boringly confined to a lectern. and matlock is especially granted the privilege of entering exhibits often by simply going to the jury and showing them, before the judge and prosecutor have even been informed of, or shown, them. no real-life judge or prosecutor would stand for this.  both perry and ben almost always ended the proceedings by wringing a confession of the real killer. actually perry nearly always did this, but often matlock would simply present overwhelming evidence of the true culprit, pronounce it ""reasonable doubt,"" and then leave it to the cops and prosecutors to proceed against the guilty party - sometimes on-camera, sometimes presumed at the end of the show.  but that said, holland taylor's histrionics and the amount of leeway afforded her, in the courtroom portion of this story, made the actions of matlock/mason more-closely resemble the slow, often boring detail such as seen on court tv and in real-life courtrooms.  every character in this presentation was either insipid, unsympathetic, obnoxious, boring, improbable - or some combination of two or more of these.  the ending was the most banal, absurd, even silly conclusion possible - but again, fascinating because of this. ladd and spano are attractive individuals, and t.v. movies would appear their best forte - probably best in 2nd-lead (probably better if ""3rd-"") roles, even in this venue. taylor could be cast as the aunt or mother of one of them. give this one 1 star for the story/performances, and 3 additional for the fascination factor.",0
"james stewart plays an fbi agent who began working with the agency before it was called the fbi and the story involves dealing with the ku klux klan, the prohibition era gangsters, world war ii german and japanese spies, etc. a continuously interesting picture covering 40 years of history; far superior to any films being made these days.  of special interest to older viewers familiar with washington, dc. in a scene about 20 minutes into the movie --- where james stewart finds out from vera miles that she's expecting their first child --- the scene was filmed in herzog's seafood restaurant on the former washington waterfront, the only movie in which this historic location appears. shortly after taking office, president kennedy decided that southwest washington, a 99% black neighborhood, was an eyesore and ought to be torn down. by decree befitting his position of undisputed royalty, the entire area, including the popular waterfront restaurant district, but excluding 3 historic churches; was reduced to rubble. black residents evicted from their homes relocated as best they could, and without federal assistance; likewise businesses were simply put out of business, few re-locating. restaurant row was converted into a sidewalk, and washington had no waterfront (restaurants, seafood stands, boats, etc) for about 10 years. as a lifetime resident, the herzog restaurant scene was our #1 reason to see this fine movie again.",1

"reign over me is a success due to the powerful work by adam sandler and don cheadle. while comedic actors going dramatic has been seen as somewhat of a distraction, sandler is no stranger to playing more serious roles. most of the characters he portrays have an unstable temperament and a vulnerability that can burst at any moment. he might even be typecast for characters with such hidden anger problems. however, this performance has some considerable dramatic weight, unlike his roles in less comedic fare like punch-drunk love and spanglish.  in the film, alan johnson (cheadle) runs into his old college roommate, charlie finerman (sandler), whom he hasn't seen in several years. five years before, charlie suffered the overwhelming loss of his wife and three daughters in a plane crash. charlie barely even recognizes cheadle's character due to the repression of his memories and consequent reclusive childish lifestyle since the accident. it isn't until alan persists in engaging him in conversation that charlie remembers who he is. their renewed relationship that follows will allow finerman to have a friend who doesn't speak about his loss, eventually enabling him to confront the thoughts and feelings he has suppressed on his own terms.  though writer-director mike binder doesn't show much sense of an individual style and some of his shots and transitions are a bit awkward, he does have a knack of getting decent to great performances from his actors while being a talented and funny writer. he shot this film with a digital camera, as more and more filmmakers are doing today, enabling the crew to shoot the night scenes with limited lighting. this kept the colorful backgrounds of new york city in focus, but resulted in creating frequent digital grain, which resembles blue specks scattered and moving on the screen.  almost every main character in reign over me gives a great performance. jada-pinkett smith and especially liv tyler are memorable in their respective roles as a frustrated wife to cheadle's character and a psychiatrist. however, it is sandler and cheadle that give some of their finest work to date. they completely owned this movie. sandler actually plays a character that doesn't outwardly resemble or act like himself at all, partially credited to his bob dylan-esquire wig. though cheadle's character has more screen time than sandler, they both should be considered to be leading roles, as they equally support and help each other throughout the film.  music also plays a great part in this film, especially the title song ""reign over me,"" or ""love, reign o'er me"" by the who, and later covered by pearl jam. in one of the most powerful moments of the film, binder shows sandler using music to shut out his feelings and memories, but this particular song provokes such intense emotion that rather than diminishing his anger, it incites his emotions. all an all, reign over me is an enjoyable, sad, yet many times funny film, driven by its amazing leading performances.",1
"divorced lawyer rick magruder (branagh) stumbles drunk out of a party hosted by his firm one night and has a chance meeting with a woman named mallory doss (davidtz), who was a waitress at the party and seems to have lost her car. rick drives the woman to her home and there they discover that her car has been already parked there, seemingly by her father, dixon doss (duvall). rick and mallory walk into the house arguing about the situation when mallory carelessly undresses in front of rick, and he then spends the night with her.  rick wakes up in the morning and mallory encounters him later in the day, asking him to file suit against her father because of his dangerous behavior. rick, now obsessed with mallory and willing to do anything for her, is successful in having dixon put on trial and sent to prison, but when he is freed by his local friends, rick finds himself in a trouble, trying to protect himself and his children from the danger he has unknowingly brought to life.",0
"warning: mild spoilers.  the story of joseph smith stands out as an amazing - even moving - episode in american history and world religious history. this movie portrays events in the life of joseph smith, whom mormons revere as the prophet of the restoration of the true church of jesus christ on the earth. i've so far seen the movie twice in its first month of public showing.  joseph smith is shown first to be the youngest of a trio of brothers (alvin, hyrum & joseph) who, at a very young age, needed an operation. the operation, done without our modern conveniences, was bloody and difficult. the scene helped to show the cohesiveness of the smith family and the bonds between the brothers and between joseph and his parents.  joseph's religious confusion and subsequent praying which lead to what mormons call the first vision was interestingly portrayed. the face of jesus is never shown, but you see the unmistakable nail marks in his hands. the rejection by religious leaders and many in his small new york community is sweetened at least slightly by joseph's marriage to emma.  this movie does not clearly map out the events of mormon church history, but merely jumps from scene to scene. this is not a critique - simply a note about the style.  the practice of tarring and feathering is shown, and it is especially dramatic and moving when joseph delivers a sermon about the savior's love with a scarred face from having recently been attacked.  the movie masterfully portrays simultaneously the joy and growth of mormonism as an infant church, while at the same time the ever-deepening opposition that spread into the heights of local governments.  the film shows many scenes from joseph's life, including a few beautiful moments portraying his relationship to emma. an attempt is made to show the depth and complexity of joseph's life, including his fierce love for his wife, his endless love for children, his wit, his courage in the face of filthy and dangerous opposition, his religious sentiments, and his compassion.  as joseph and hyrum ride to carthage, never to return home alive, most of the characters from throughout the movie, whose lives had been touched by joseph, are shown along the way, helping to reinforce what was already seen but setting up the final scene to be more powerful.  at the end, the martyrdom of joseph and hyrum is portrayed, and moviegoers are left to ponder the events they just witnessed.  when i first watched the movie i assumed it was made by the church to introduce joseph smith to non-members. i no longer think that is the case, although i hope the movie can do just that. as an insider, i find that the film is a celebration of joseph and excellently reinforces the good things we already know about him. i am curious to see how outsiders will view the film - whether they will simply see it as propagandic, an epic story of an american religious man, or something else.  the film is beautifully shot, family friendly, moving and, hopefully, something good for everyone. that the events portrayed actually happened in these united states of america is interesting to ponder in light of the many aspects of our culture - including freedom of religious expression and respect (generally) for the law - we moderns take for granted.",1
"second-tier american leading man guy madison plays a character whose notoriety precedes him in this spaghetti western  which, having very modest credentials emerges as essentially routine (though featuring a nice enough score). the plot offers some mild interest: the title, incidentally, refers to a wounded man involved in the murderous assault by gun-runners on a ranch  the property of the family of their pursuer, cavalry agent madison. the latter's younger siblings are determined that the injured party, now in their charge, lead them to the gang boss responsible; ultimately, the identity of either mystery man proves a surprise  and both, ironically, become involved with one of madison's sisters (another is raped during the raid). euro-cult starlet rosalba neri appears unremarkably as a saloon hostess, and madison's ex-flame.",0
"this review owes its existence entirely to a review. we take a weekly tv magazine to see what is coming up, and duly decide what we will watch. obligingly, there are brief reviews of most of the films scheduled to be shown on the five major terrestrial channels. in addition to the prose, each film is allocated a 1-5 star rating. 5 means don't miss (superior to 4 for excellent!), down to 1 standing for poor. we have learned from vast experience that, with few exceptions, stars are awarded for gross taste, foul language, offensive content, promiscuity, horror, blood & guts, and especially killing off the hero/heroine just when everyone was about to live happily ever after. (if that isn't done, the movie is denigrated as being 'predictable' - the worst insult imaginable!)  brave new girl was given only 1 star, thereby suggesting it was a candidate worthy of our time and attention. this was confirmed by the reviewer's description of the movie as being a ""truly awful tale"", and, ""stupid, just stupid"". we watched it, and my wife and i were glad we did so. the tv magazine reviewer further stated that the movie was ""not a reworking of war and peace"", with which we have to agree. reading through the imdb reviews for this title a day or two later, the urge to pick up my pen (so to speak) to add my halfpennyworth (pronounced harf'pen'uth (emphasis on the first syllable) for the uninitiated) became overwhelming.  why did we take to this movie? well, it's just a matter of taste. we like attractive characters, believable relationships between them, interesting situations, courtesy and respect, good triumphing over evil, and so on. we liked the integrity and personalities of holly (lindsey haun), her mum (virginia madsen), ditz (barbara mamabolo), grant (nick roth), zoe (joanne boland) and the two male professors involved in the story. so what if the storyline includes a 'wicked witch of the west' in the form of angela (barbara mamabolo), provided that she plays the part with some conviction. we appreciated the friendship depicted between the two room-mates, with one having a financially challenged upbringing by a loving single mum, and the other having every material advantage but receiving little parental time and affection. is it any wonder that ditz felt the way she did about holly's mum? is it surprising that grant should take an immediate interest in holly, considering the manner of their initial meeting, holly's dazzling smiles and her lively self-possession? i think these issues and the events are believable enough, but it is necessary to pretend that the scholarship and other circumstances are realistic in order for the tale to have a setting.  my wife and i are greatly blessed by not having any significant musical education. this enables us to enjoy the sounds produced by instruments and voices without having our critical faculties intruding unduly on our listening, and thus spoiling the experience. we enjoyed both the classical pieces and the pop, which came over well on the tv, and we weren't struck by any lack of talent. also, it mattered not that holly's classical vocals were dubbed by someone else.  we enjoyed the movie enough to look for a dvd. the average delivered price we have paid per disk for the movies in our collection currently stands at £4.9484 (rounded to four decimal places). brave new girl was available from a trusted supplier on the amazon marketplace for £1.3516 (rounded to four decimal places) above this figure. such a purchase would increase the average. why i should resent this is a mystery to me, but it is a testimony to our enjoyment of this film that we placed an order anyway. i have awarded this film 7 imdb stars out of ten, having docked one for overenthusiastic reception of the performances by the audiences, one for britney advertising and one for something else i can't remember right now.

"tigerland / (2000) ***1/2 (out of four)  by blake french:  	throughout the years audiences have seen and understood war films with every point of view possible, and somehow producers and writers always come up with new and innovative methods of portraying various soldiers on the battlefield. joel schumacher (""8mm,"" ""a time to kill""), easily one of the riskiest directors currently working, has found resemblance with ""the thin red line"" in the way his new drama ""tigerland"" steps in an individual soldier's shoes. this movie, written by ross klavan and michael mcguther, has more guts and irony than ""the thin red line"" or even ""saving private ryan."" although the movie's dramatic impact is somewhat lessened due to the perversity of the material present, it certainly enlightens us on a new perspective of young men training for war.   	i would want to know joel schumacher's experiences with the army. are the men really this unabashed and brutal? i am sure some of them are, but the movie views its uncompromising world through the eyes of a young man named roland bozz (colin farrell), who is rebellious against the ideas of war. his personality instantly counteracts with several other characters, one who becomes his best friend, paxton (matthew davis), and another, wilson (russell richardson), whose flamed temper often exasperates bozz's tension with the idea of going to war. the war depicted in this production is not found on a battlefield, but on training grounds of a louisiana-based instruction camp between conceptions and fears of the soldiers in training. this film is specifically about the preparation for war, nothing more nothing less. it ends when the soldiers finally go to war, kind of disappointing since witnessing the characters in action would have served as a supurb payoff.    shot on location in about 28 days using 16mm stock and a minuscule budget, joel schumacher accurately displays a gritty, perverse, cruel, and unmerciful atmosphere using hand-held cinematography, unique lighting techniques and direct sound. schumacher's grainy and blown-out images make the movie feel like a documentary feature. this unusual style of filmmaking only contributes to the hard core realism of the movie, quite graphic in its use of coarse language, perhaps a little too disturbing. waves of four-letter words pound the audience, some in shock of what they are hearing. even the extreme amount of vulgarism does not keep the dialogue from prevailing as heartbreaking, true, and emotional.  	if anything, ""tigerland"" provides us with a minor appreciation of how much our soldiers go through for our country in the beginning stages of combat. such bravery must it take to enlist in the army during times of war, knowing the hardships and risks that are being taken. such thought-provoking ideas are made possible through the heartbreaking performances by the young aspiring actors who portray the various trainees. this movie is not for all audiences, but one that young men should take a look at before enlisting themselves in the army...and adult audiences should watch to appreciate the courage needed to do such.

"overlong drama that isn't capable of making any real point. so she became an actress - so what? she learned to love - big deal. there is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations, but the kind which is bad for the movie, causing it to often seem absurd.  summer phoenix, playing the lead, talks and behaves like a semi-retarded person, so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater - which was clearly not the intended point. we are told early on (in that ""barry lyndon""-like narration) that she learned to hide her emotions, which certainly explains her autistic stone-face, but the movie suffers for it. she basically walks around like a zombie, and her success as an actress isn't quite credible given her lack of emotions. occasionally, the movie had that dull, sleepy feel of a dogma 95 movie. is it one? i wouldn't be at all surprised.  summer phoenix is sister of joaquim phoenix and the late river phoenix. nepotism rarely works.  if you'd like to see my hollywood nepotism list, with over 350 pictures/entries, contact me by e-mail.",0

"angela johnson (pamela springsteen--yes she's related to bruce), the killer from the first film, is up to her old tricks again. she's one of the counselors at camp rolling hills. as long as the girls at camp are nice and stay away from sex, drugs and swearing things are fine. but a few step over the line and angela kills them--cracking bad jokes all the way.  the original ""sleepaway camp"" was a vicious and nasty splatter film but had some good points to it. this is vicious and nasty too but has no good points to it. the plot has been done to death and this adds nothing new to the formula. there are plenty of gory killings in here (people are burnt alive, heads are cut off, throats slashed) but all the gore is so obviously fake it actually become comical. this also has the smallest amount of campers i've ever seen and virtually everyone is far too old for their roles (especially higgins). as expected there's the gratuitous female nudity (here provided by the tremendously untalented valerie hartman) and the obligatory good girl/good boy team (renne estevez and tony higgins). with the sole exception of springsteen and higgins the acting is lousy--even by slasher movie standards. there's also a cruel edge to this movie in which one character is drowned in an outhouse! boring and sick with a stupid plot, pointless nudity and bad gore. skip it.",0
"following the success of the (awful) gilligan's island tv movie reruns, a number of tv movies were made in the 1980's reuniting casts from classic shows. most of these movies completely missed the boat as far as recapturing the humor that made the shows so special. the munsters revenge is among the most disappointing because it goes for a laurel and hardy-type comedy style that really wasn't in the original series. yvonne de carlo, a wonderful comedienne and essential to the series, is completely wasted - she has less time here in this 90 minute movie than she did in any single 30 minute episode. and since the roles of ""eddie"" and ""marilyn"" in this movie are nothing more than cameos, what was the point of making them younger and recasting them? with very little rewriting, they could have used butch patrick and pat priest. although seeing some of the munsters spooky relatives was a nice touch, i didn't enjoy sid caesar as the hammy mad scientist mainly because there's too much of him and not enough of the underused munsters (ironically that very year, 1981, caesar's old partner in comedy, imogene coca, was also inappropriately cast in a major part in a tv movie reunion return of the beverly hillbillies). another strange inexplicable bit at the beginning of the film has the munster family represented as wax figures at a local horror wax museum. why would they be in there when they are supposed to be a ""typical"" (if strange) american family, not famous monsters? this was the last munsters project featuring the original cast in their roles, there was an awful revival of the series in the late 1980's with a completely new cast and a 1990's tv movie which featured decarlo, lewis, priest, and patrick in cameo roles as a family dining.",0
"i really have to disagree with guy-yardley-rees who (should he have watched the entire film) would have seen some absolutely stunning scottish scenery (some of the best ever shot in skye) and found a film with a difficult start come together into a really poignant whole.  this is not a big budget film. rather it is a film that has a strong community feel.  i can't say how much 'standard' films bore me - pushing out the same polished stuff again and again. seachd doesn't seem to be about that at all. it really seems to be trying to offer something more real and certainly more gaelic than any recent scottish film.  ok, so the acting isn't in the style a blockbuster. that's because the actors are seemingly real people. i actually thought that the key roles of the boy and his grandfather were really convincing - and at times unusually beautiful.  seachd really bears a second viewing, since there are many threads that become clearer second time around - that really do feed into the ending.  overall, the combination of music and (at times) stunning visuals, plus a community approach to the acting and non-normal structure has turned seachd into quite a distinctive and memorable film. more of these please!",1

"maslin beach is a real nudist/naturist beach south of adelaide, on the fleurieu peninsula, in south australia. it is also the name of an australian film that used the beach as a location.  maslin beach is labelled a romantic comedy. this could be slightly misleading, as it is not a 'hilarious' film, nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense, but it does have light-hearted moments. much as life itself, there are also moments of sadness too. it is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above, and nudity runs throughout the length of film. the viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal, and concentrate on the plot, not the copious amount of flesh.  simon and marcie (michael allen and eliza lovell) arrive by car at a beach-side car park. they take their belongings to the beach, and while they are walking, a voice-over from simon talks about his confusion about what real love is. the rest of the film is an exploration of this, framed by one complete day at the beach. the basic story is of what happens to simon's love life, but there are also many other characters highlighted in several separate vignettes.  when they arrive at the beach, both simon and marcie appear bored with each other. marcie sees them as a 'romeo and juliet' romantic couple. simon is just bored with it all. next, we are introduced to gail (bonnie-jaye lawrence), paula (zara collins) and jenny (jennifer ross). they are walking down the beach together discussing gail's chances of finding the 'perfect' man, aided by the 'powers' of a necklace that brought good luck to her grandmother. however, there are many more interesting people on the beach, not all of them 'attractive' and young (part of the realism of this film).  to service the beach's patrons there is a flatulent, short-sighted ice-cream salesperson with a van. this is ben (gary waddell), who is a friend of simon, and is also his unofficial counsellor. i would think that this character is the main comic element. it is hard to say though, as there is nothing about ben that would make you laugh aloud, unless you were intoxicated, male and very young! maslin beach does have a major redeeming feature though, and that is that it does not dwell too long on any one subject. as the quality of acting is variable, the script is suspect and everything about maslin beach is cheap, the lack of continuity is a positive boon. in fact, there is something about this film (not the nudity) that i find appealing. it is hard to define what it is, but it could be something to do with its bluntness, and downright 'aussie' attitude to carnal matters.  the camera work in maslin beach deserves a mention. sometimes it is very good, with some stunning static shots and 'pans' of the beach, cliffs and a sunset. as nudity is a major factor in this film, framing is an important aspect of the camera work. there is no sense of gratuity in the framing, meaning that the framing is done so that the camera does not dwell on 'private' body parts. this helps to ease any sense of viewer discomfort from being within the subject's 'personal space', and makes the film more tasteful. not an easy task, given the location for filming.  maslin beach is neither a 'skin flick' for post-pubescent, testosterone charged males, nor a 'mills and boon' romance for under-appreciated women. maslin beach does not seem to fit anywhere in genre. the actors are not 'attractive' in the baywatch sense, and are just 'normal' people that you would see on the beach anywhere. it does not have a message to put across and it would not even act as a tourism advertisement, other than perhaps to naturists. apart from the australian accent, the filming could have been in any sunny country. what makes this film distinctly australian is the fact that it is pointless (cinema verite?), and only australian cinema, and other medium sized national cinemas, could consider such a rash option. at the same time, these medium sized cinemas have room for experimentation in the quest for identity, and a 'flop' is not going to damage their reputation too much. it is always possible, given that maslin beach is now a collector's item, that the film might become internationally popular, but it is very unlikely.  during this critique, i have been sounding highly negative, at times, about maslin beach. this is not the real position, as i found the film very easy to watch. i enjoyed it as a reflection of near reality and real people (and problems). the problems confronted in the film are those of the everyday, and a little low on spectacle. this does it no harm in my view, and i wish that more films dealt with the everyday like this. there is a connection here with the cinemas of europe, and with french film in particular. they rarely deal with major disasters or catastrophes, but with the everyday. hollywood is in direct opposition to this, and rides the crest of the hyper-real action/drama/angst wave. the pace too, is much faster in hollywood, but it is not reality. maslin beach is not exactly 'jacques tati' either, but it is on the right track, even if it does ignore issues of multi culturalism, equality, gender orientation and so on, that are of such importance in current cinema. i am sure that you will either love or hate this film, with little room for a middle ground.

"part two picks up... not where the last film left off. as part of the quasi-conventionality of steven soderbergh's epic 4+ hour event, che's two stories are told as classic ""rise"" and ""fall"" scenarios. in part two, che guevara, leaving his post as a bureaucrat in cuba and after a failed attempt in the congo (only in passing mentioned in the film), goes down to bolivia to try and start up another through-the-jungle style revolution. things don't go quite as well planned, at all, probably because of che's then notorious stature as a communist and revolutionary, and in part because of america's involvement on the side of the bolivian government, and, of course, that castro wasn't really around as a back-up for che.  as it goes, the second part of che is sadder, but in some ways wiser than the first part. which makes sense, as guevara has to endure low morale from his men, betrayals from those around him, constant mistakes by grunts and nearby peasants, and by ultimately the enclosing, larger military force. but what's sadder still is that guevara, no matter what, won't give in. one may see this as an incredible strength or a fatal flaw- maybe both- but it's also clear how one starts to see che, if not totally more fully rounded, then as something of a more sympathetic character. true, he did kill, and executed, and felt justified all the way. and yet it starts to work on the viewer in the sense of a primal level of pity; the sequence where guevara's health worsens without medicine, leading up to the shocking stabbing of a horse, marks as one of the most memorable and satisfying of any film this year.  again, soderbergh's command of narrative is strong, if, on occasion, slightly sluggish (understandable due to the big running time), and one or two scenes just feel totally odd (matt damon?), but these are minor liabilities. going this time for the straight color camera approach, this is almost like a pure militia-style war picture, told with a great deal of care for the men in the group, as well as guevara as the lord-over this group, and how things dwindle down the final scene. and as always, del-toro is at the top of his game, in every scene, every beat knowing this guy so well- for better and for worse- that he comes about as close to embodiment as possible. overall, the two parts of che make up an impressive package: history as drama in compelling style, good for an audience even if they don't know che or, better, if they don't think highly of him. it's that special. 8.5/10",1
"what a loss the passing of director emile ardolino was! he could take a light script and, with the right casting and editing, put a twinkle in it and make it shine like a star. this particular star may not be the brightest in the sky as great romances go, but it is definitely one that keeps you tuned in to the end. you really want to know how things are going to work out.  the script is perfect for cybill shepherd, who at the time needed to capitalize on her ""moonlighting"" success for the new generation who was (fortunately for her) probably unaware of how many big screen major duds she had after a very promising start. in this film she's every bit back in form as a still-pining widow living vicariously through her daughter (mary stuart masterson on the cusp of stardom which would peak with ""fried green tomatoes"" two years later). she may have looked too young for the role, but that works well for the way the story unfolds. this is her film, but she doesn't overstep her bounds as a lead.  shepherd graciously allows robert downey jr. to carry much of the film and shows a more mature comic flair than he had in his previous films to that point. and there's ample support from ryan o'neal (in his best role in years) and christopher macdonald. masterson's natural charm pretty much coasts on its own, either that or she has a way of making her character seem like a breath of fresh air with every word.  ardolino makes good use of his cast's sex appeal the same way he did with ""dirty dancing"", but this film is not quite as sizzling so you could still watch it with your parents if they happened to be in the room. (use your best judgment, they're your parents after all.) i give this film a high mark because it is very user friendly, romantic comedy enthusiasts will find it sublime, and those who are just watching along with them should find plenty of humor to enjoy as well.  again, credit goes to emile ardolino for making the most of a charming script by randy and perry howze. (where are they now?) ardolino's next film would be the phoned-in sequel to ""three men and a baby"" but his final theatrical release (sister act) would finally give him the nine-figure-grossing smash hit he deserved. mr. ardolino, your cinematic touch is missed!",1
"the title of this film is taken from a party game called ""seven minutes in heaven."" the game was popular among my husband's friends when he was in junior high school in brooklyn, ny, and he describes it as something like ""spin-the-bottle,"" ""lifesaver relay,"" and other preteen kissing games. according to the rules, a boy's name and a girl's would be drawn, and the chosen ones ordered to get into a dark closet together and to stay there for seven minutes. in the meantime, there would be speculation among party guests as to whether or not the two had the nerve to hold hands, embrace, and/or kiss each other in the privacy of the closet. at the end of seven minutes, the game leader would say, ""time's up"" or knock on the closet door, and the couple would emerge from the closet. after being quizzed by the other guests, the couple would have to admit what they had done during their ""seven minutes in heaven."" then other couples would be chosen to enter the closet until all the guests had participated. the couple who admitted to doing the most would be the winners of the game.  such games have served as social ""ice-breakers"" for children and teens, but they can be embarrassing and intimidating to shy individuals. the film has been given this title because it deals with the teens' first experiences with crushes and romantic love.",1
"this movie is a little ray of sunshine in a dark season. it celebrates a quality best described as plain old friendliness. morgan freeman plays a character very like freeman himself--a successful actor pushing 70. he has traveled to a small, rather grimy grocery store intending to research a part he might play, as a manager of such a place. he soon beguiles the staff and the customers, especially the lovely, if cranky, young woman (paz vega) who presides over the ""10 items or less"" checkout lane.  10 items or less doesn't have a big statement to make and doesn't pretend that it does. it follows freeman and vega as they become friendly, and as the older man offers his counsel, in exchange for a ride home--the movie-company gofer who is supposed to pick him up never shows and freeman has forgotten his own phone number so he can't call for help. i had a little case of the blues on a gray sunday afternoon in new york city and this flick cured what ailed me.",1
"bad plot (though good for a b-movie), good fast-paced fight scenes, at most a 5 out of 10. but something has always bothered me about this film: how come mariska hargitay never speaks? in the tv version, she shares several intimate moments with jeff speakman, even a kiss in a garden. yet in the regular (video) version, most of her scenes are cut and she never speaks at all. this bothers me because it not only takes out a female (though cliched) point-of-view to the film, it also makes the final shot seem creepy. this film would have been better had they kept her scenes in, because in those scenes at least she has a personality, one that undercuts whatever speakman says.",0
"i was in second grade, 12 years ago. i remember it clearly. we were learning about space. all little kids want to go to space, right? well, after i saw this, i was so scared to death that i would 'accidentally' get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind. i had no idea that this was a movie. i thought it was some news program or something. i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program 'war of the worlds.' so, recently, i get this movie again to watch, realizing my favorite actor, joaquin phoenix was in it (then known as leaf phoenix). i can tell you, i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting. i mean, when andy is in space, she moves in slow motion, did you ever notice that? i don't think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow.  the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank, and begins to float backwards as the security doors close. little max is trying to pull her in. suddenly, we get a major close up on max's face as he shouts (in slow motion) ""whaaaaatttt'ssss happpeniiiinngggg?!?!?"" i had no idea.",0
"there's the danger with the critic/philosopher slavoj zizek with his film, directed by sophie fiennes, which takes together a wonderful amalgam of silent, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers together to make his points ofr freudian comparisons to overload. but in the pervert's guide to cinema he also makes even the more far-reaching points a point of departure from any other analysis i've seen on a collective section of films. while it doesn't cover the expansive territory scorsese's movie documentaries cover, the same attachments are there, and zizek has a definite love for all of these ""perverse"" examples and films, primarily the work of hitchcock, lynch, chaplin and tarkovsky. yet one shouldn't go into seeing this- if you can find it that is, i got to see it almost by luck- thinking zizek will just try and dissect all of the psycho-sexual parts or parts referring it in an obtuse, deranged manner. if anything he opens up one to points that might never be considered otherwise- would one think of three of the marx brothers as representations of the id, super-ego and ego (harpo's example is most dead-on for me).  he's not just one to take on the classics though, he also considers the food for thought in the matrix and fight club- in representations of the split between fantasy and reality and if the matrix needs the energy as much as the energy needs the matrix for the former, and in the attachment of violence in dealing with one's own self as well as ones double in the latter. he even throws in a piece from the pivotal moment in revenge of the sith when anakin becomes darth vader, and the implications of shunning away fatherhood under that back mask at the very moment his children's births happens elsewhere. the ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, the male point of view in turning fantasy into reality (at which point zizek rightfully points to as the moment of a nightmare's creation), and female subjectivity, are explored perhaps most dead-on with vertigo. this too goes for a scene that zizek deconstructs as if it's the zapruder film, where he dissects the three colliding points of psycho-sexual stance in the 'don't you look at me' scene in blue velvet.  now it would be one thing if zizek himself went about making these sincere, excited, and somehow plausible points just face on to the camera or mostly in voice-over as scorsese does. but he goes a step further to accentuate his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread off more crucially into some netherworld or primordial feeling for some characters (i.e. lost highway) by putting himself in the locations the films take place in. funniest is first seeing him in the boat ""heading"" towards the same dock tippi hedren's boat heads to at the beginning of the birds; equally funny is as he waters the blue velvet lawn he goes on to explain the multi-faceted points of frank booth; only one, when he's in solaris-like territory, does it seem a little cheesy. but zizek seems to be having a lot of fun with this set-up, and after a while one bypasses the potential crux of this gimmick and zizek's words come through.  there were some films i of course would've expected, chiefly from hitchcock and lynch, but a treat for movie buffs come from seeing two things- the movies that one would never think of seeing in a film about films titled the pervert's guide of cinema (top two for me would be the disney pluto cartoon and the exposition on chaplin's films, albeit with a great note about the power and distinction of 'voice'), and the ones that one hasn't seen yet (i.e. the ventriloquist horror film, dr. mabuse, stalker, among a few others) that inspire immediate feelings of 'wow, i have to see that immediately, no questions asked.' zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and puts it forward with a clarity that reminds one why we watch movies in the first place, to be entertained, sure, but also to have that actual experience of sitting down and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet. it's probably one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a splendidly narrow analysis of how freud works its way into films regarding desire, the id/super-ego/ego, and of the supernatural in fantasy, that you may never see...unless distribution finally kicks in, if only on the smallest levels.",1
"and here's yet another piece of evidence to claim that we should all worship the italian giallo and acknowledge it to be the absolute most unique sub genre in horror. emilio miraglia's ""the red queen kills seven times"" is a totally mesmerizing wholesome of original plotting, stylish production values, enchanting music, great acting talents and inventively gory murder sequences. it's a fabulous giallo (released in the golden year 1972) that belongs in the top-five of every fan of italian cinema. the storyline doesn't just introduce your average black-gloved & sexually frustrated killer, but blends good old-fashioned revenge motives with the macabre myth of the murderous ""red queen"". at young age, their grandfather tells the constantly fighting siblings kitty and evelyn about an uncanny lady who, once every 100 years on april 6th, kills seven people of which her sister is the inevitable last victim. fourteen years later, kitty has become the successful choreographer of a prominent modeling agency (even sharing her bed with the general manager) when suddenly the killing spree begins. sister evelyn would be the obvious culprit, but she moved to the states recently... or has she? complex yet compelling and involving red herrings are thrown at you every couple of minutes and the red queen character is definitely the most fascinating killer in giallo-history. her face can never be seen, but she wears a blood red cloak and produces the most ghastly laugh whenever she made a new victim. she's not exactly gentle either, as her victims are barbarically stabbed with a dagger, dragged behind cars and even impaled on fences! that latter one is truly one of the greatest (= most gruesome) acts of violence i've ever seen! what more could you possibly request? some classy and tasteful nudity, perhaps? the gorgeous female actresses got this more than covered, among them barbara bouchet and a young sybil danning. emilio miraglia isn't the most famous giallo-director, as he only made this one and the equally recommended ""the night evelyn came out of the grave"", but his influence and importance should not be forgotten.",1
"another exquisite taste of what a superhero movie should be after batman:dead end that just helps stimulate our taste buds and leave us wanting more! this is what a real superhero movie should look like and feel like! even tough this is a fanfilm of sorts. the attention to detail, character and action is undeniably real. although this is a limited resources production, it puts to shame big budgeted, star-casted, hyped productions ""other"" superhero related movies. here the main and supporting characters act and look like they are real life people. finally, a superman that actually looks ""super"" and looks like the real thing! batman the way it should be, without the flashy rubber-casted , ripped body armor to hide scrawny physiques for over paid actors that don't deliver. i just wish that some sensible warner bros. exec gives the ok to produce a full length adaptation of this jewel. i don't care if it goes to theaters or straight to dvd, i would never get tired of watching it. just the plot itself is worth my hard earned dough for this. hope the ""bigwigs"" at marvel & dc productions take a look and see what a real well produced superhero movie should look. no more ""batman & robin"" fiasco, or hulk, daredevil, etc. learn from these small time directors and learn that there shouldn't be any reason to ""reinvent"" the hero for the movie, just to have it ""bomb"" in theaters. mr. collora...we need more directors like you!!",1
"first of all this was not a three hour movie - two hours, ten minutes... last time i checked commercials aren't actually part of a movie! perhaps, though, it should've been a two parter for a total of about 3 hours? yeah, would have gotten more in, been able to explore some more emotion. overall, though, it was an interesting look into the lives of lucy and desi. i watch i love lucy from time to time and love it but never have i read or seen a biography, never knew anything about their lives off the screen. because of this movie i do now but i'm not so sure that's a good thing. everything here no one really needed to know. this was essentially a movie that didn't need to be made. but it was made and the reason is because lucy & desi are still such huge stars and certain people in american society feel that the rest of society needs to know all about our tv and movie stars. that is definitely so not true and very, very sad.  anyway, what was shown here in lucy was pretty good. two complaints - the actress who played viv vance - not great casting at all. and the switch from madeline zima to rachel york.... uhhh, like lucy had plastic surgery and all of a sudden she's a whole new person!? that wasn't too great. but the story went on and focused on the rocky relationship between lucy & desi. no, the kids were not shown very much at all and that wasn't necessarily a drawback to this movie because like i said, this focused mainly just on lucy & desi. had there been more time, had the story been more about lucy's entire life, then maybe the kids woulda been there more. but they weren't so we got to see the likes of gable & lombard, red skelton and buster keaton very briefly instead. wow, that was one thing about this story that i thought was really cool: his presence and influence in lucy's life. really neat and it's too bad that wasn't explored more. oh well. what was explored was done well, for the most part. honestly, i don't think i'll ever watch this again and i don't think this movie'll be that memorable. for someone who digs i love lucy but isn't an enormous lucille ball fan, this should be an interesting watch. my grade for this: b",1
"this movie is all ultra-lightweight fluff, predictable from beginning to end. as a don knotts vehicle, ""the incredible mr. limpet"" was much better, with knott's character there not nearly as incompetent or ignorant. his performance there was toned down, with none of his trademark goggle-eyed stare, although that may have something to do with him being replaced for most of the movie by a cartoon fish. knotts made a living of playing the likable imbecile, much as bob denver did. neither really seemed to be able to break out to other types of roles, assuming they were simply typecast. it was probably because of the slouch, the wild stare and the high-pitched voice. john ritter, whom knotts worked with in ""three's company,"" was able to transcend his genre, branching out successfully into dramatic roles like ""the dreamer of oz,"" but the closest knotts ever got was a small role in ""pleasantville."" even leslie nielsen was a bad fit here, uncomfortably neither straight dramatic actor as he was at the time nor deadpan comedic actor as he later became in ""airplane!"" and ""police squad.""  there's also no way the then-43 year-old knotts could pass for a 35 year-old, as his character insisted he was. it was as ludicrously unbelievable as tom hanks at 38 playing the college-age forrest gump.  the film was clearly made on a shoestring budget, very much looking like a hastily-filmed tv episode. it's especially evident in the ""exterior"" scenes of the ""town"" where roy goes after he's fired. it's unlikely even a pre-schooler would be fooled by the mayberry-like soundstage artificiality.  even viewing this strictly as a children's movie, it's very disappointing. it's not because it lacks action or special effects, although it does. the pace is much too slow, the situations repetitive. how many times can you watch roy getting onto a bus? a comedy for kids should at least sometimes be madcap, with breakneck gags, otherwise you risk boring them (and any adults in the theater as well). movies, even kid's movies, have improved quite a bit in the intervening decades. even many contemporary comedies were better filmed and written. disney's ""the love bug,"" for instance, at least had some interesting race action.",0
"if you played ""spider-man"" on the ps version, then you've seen it all. to truly experience it you should get the dc version. simply put it's a much graphically superior game; the textures are sharp, levels are easy to navigate, and it has much better sound then it's ps cousin. i bought this game back in late '00s and it still holds up even till this day. well, marvel: ultimate alliance is a much superior and strategic game but if you're a fan of 'ol web head then you owe it yourself to pick this up for your gaming library. swinging around the city as spidey has never looked this good and dead-on in a video game. if you have a dreamcast, snag this up for cheap. the dc version is simply incredible.",1
"i just watched this movie and have to say, i was very impressed. it's very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat! i had to smoke several ""emergency"" cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves! if i had to criticise, i'd say that perhaps if anything, there were too many jump moments. it got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect, because you kind of new what was coming.  although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre, they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy, fear-factor. it had elements of the shining, the 6th sense and the changeling (in particular, the soundtrack reminded me of the changeling).  i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good old-fashioned scare!",1
"sometimes i rest my head and think about the reasons why movies about killer sharks and/or crocodiles are still getting made these days. they've been making these lame ""jaws""-copies since the 70s, it's not like they're getting any more well-liked. the idea is still exactly the same. so we have an animal that starts murdering people. first it takes down some secondary characters, then it starts attacking the main characters, usually played by a couple of nobodies except for someone who used to be a bit more famous, who usually plays a specialist. one of the main characters usually dies before the others kill the animal somehow, usually with an explosion. then, we usually get a last shot where we see that the animal is still alive, or has laid eggs, etc. etc. ""krocodylus"" basically uses the same overused ideas, and does absolutely nothing to create even a tad bit of variation. unless you count the fact that the ""specialist"" is a captain in this one variation, in that case your standards are pretty low. it's funny that he's played by duncan regehr though, he like totally used to be zorro.hell i'll give it a bonus point for that.",0
"pickup on south street is one of the most brilliant movies ever made. an example of the directing: when candy (jean peters) starts going through her purse and notices her wallet is missing, an alarm goes off in the background in the building she's in -- as if it's an alarm going off in her head. it's not cartoon-like -- it's subtly woven into the background in a way that strikes you on a subconscious level until you've seen the film a few times and it just ""clicks"" that there's an alarm bell going off when she starts frantically going through her bag.  richard widmark is way on top of his game as a smart-alec -- he's really great -- but the highlight performance of the film was the first scene for ""moe,"" the street peddler/informer, played by thelma ritter. later, in her apartment, you are not seeing a movie -- you're seeing a real person. i've never seen anyone ""act"" so real i felt like i was looking into a real room until ritter's performance -- right down to the way her hair stuck out a bit when she removed her hat.   about a million other things just *worked,* from the way lightning louie picks up money with his chopsticks to the way candy's jewelry clicks when she flicks moe's hand away from her brooch, to the way moe gets the dollars and change from the police captain across the fbi guy's chest -- and even the way the captain opens his filing cabinet, like he's been doing it in that way in that room for many years. ""pickup on south street"" is detailed moves (directing) with consummate performances (acting) and superb now-nostalgic visuals of the day, such as the panel truck, the boards leading to the shack out on the water, the dumbwaiter, -- and the unforgettable place skip stashes his pocket pickings. wonderful stuff.  ""pickup on south street"" is also one of the few movies where, even though the characters aren't perfect, you do care about them -- perhaps because they have been somewhat branded by their pasts in ways that are hard to escape: skip as a ""three-time loser"" and candy as a youngish woman who has ""knocked around"" a lot. when these people behave a little more badly than you'd expect, it's in sort of novel ways that make it seem you're looking in at people you'd never otherwise imagine -- and yet you know that they are possible because the actors make them so recognizably human.",1

"if there's one genre that i've never been a fan of, it's the biopic. always misleading, filled with false information, over-dramatized scenes, and trickery all around, biopics are almost never done right. even in the hands of the truly talented directors like martin scorsese (the aviator) and ron howard (a beautiful mind), they often do a great disservice to the people they are trying to capture on screen. skeptiscism takes the place of hype with the majority of biopics that make their way to the big screen and the notorious bettie page was no different. some critics and moviegoers objected to gretchen mol given the role of bettie page, saying she was no longer a celebrity and didn't have the chops for the part. i never doubted mol could handle the part since, but i never expected to as blown as away by her performance as i was upon just viewing the film hours ago. mol delivers a knockout oscar worthy performance as the iconic 1950's pin-up girl, who, after an early life of abuse (depicted subtlety and tastefully done, something few directors would probably do) inadvertently becomes one of the most talked about models of all time. the picture covers a lot of ground in its 90 minute running time yet despite no less than three subplots, there is still a feeling that there may be a small portion missing from the story. director/co-writer marry harron and guinevere turner's fantastic script is only marred by a too abrupt and not as clear as it should be ending. still, credit must be given to the two ladies for creating a nearly flawless biopic that manages to pay tribute to both its subject and the decade it emulates masterfully. come oscar time, mol, turner, and harron should be receiving nominations. doubt it will happen, though there certainly are no three women more deserving of them. 9/10",1
"i saw this film at the ny gay & lesbian film festival and thought it was pretty bad. first and most distracting was the way much of it was shot; that is, a lot of slow motion and overly arty close-ups that seemed to have no point--story wise or aesthetically--other than to show the skills of the cinematographer (who i believe was also the director). this film seemed what a pretentious film student would come up with. the lead actor (sam levine) was certainly very cute, but was a mediocre actor at best; and the rest of the cast ranged from so-so, to bad. the story itself was mostly annoyingly predictable. i do have to concede that most of the audience seemed to enjoy the film; laughing and sighing constantly, but i disliked it a great deal.",0
"director otto preminger reunites with his laura stars dana andrews and gene tierney in this rough and ready to rumble film noir: where the sidewalk ends. this film is complete with a well-written crime story with interesting characters, unexpected turns, and clever dialogue and an eye-pleasing look with great camera movements and dark and gritty film noir lighting. dana andrews stars as detective mark dixon, part mobster and part cop, who has a reputation of being too physically tough with criminals. after one case sees dixon in search of suspects and answers, he gets far more involved than he wanted.   dana andrews is terrific in his role - tough and edgy, andrews' dixon is ready to knock any and all off their heels if they get on his bad side. he's the perfect film noir anti-hero - he's not very nice all the time, but we still root for him. gene tierney does a solid job in her role, as much as it is, being a sweet shoulder for dixon. there might not be too much to tierney's role, but she certainly goes above and beyond what others could do with the role, knocking every member of the audience out with her kind smile, gentle manner, and twinkle in her eye. the supporting cast isn't too bad either - karl malden being the most memorable, stepping in and giving a good supporting performance as lieutenant thomas. where the sidewalk ends is no laura, but it is a great film noir filled with great characters, story, and picture.",1
"for the initial 20 minutes or so (i was watching it on a ps2 so i've really no idea how long it took) alienator sets up an interesting premise. i don't think i've seen a slasher movie with an alien from another planet as the baddie before. however, interest soon turns into stunned disbelief as you realise the 'alien' is a huge body-builder woman in a steel bikini. yes, alienator is patently ridiculous.  don't think i hold that against it. in the world of shlock-horror, patently ridiculous can often be a good sign. however, the blatant stupidity of its premise is all the movie really has going for it. alienator is funny as hell, but it is also a shambolic suckfest of the highest order. actors heap on failed attempts at seriousness, potentially genius lines of pure cheese dialogue are stumbled over with unnerving incompetence and the direction fails to sum up even one or two decent set-pieces. by the time the movie's finished you can barely see the original concept through the haystack of total tripe the team piled on it.  add to this the fact that the 'alien' just kills people by vaporising them, as opposed to doing any 'slashing' as such and you have a giant throbbing heap of good ideas being left to rot. you'll laugh at alienator, but at it, not with it. if that's your thing then go ahead and check it out.",0

"this is a fascinating film--especially to old movie buffs and historians (i am both). during the first half of the twentieth century, sadly, black americans were usually not allowed into white theaters. as a result, theaters catering to black audiences wanted to show films reflecting the black experience and showing black actors. in many cases, the films were essentially similar plot-wise to standard hollywood fare, but with a much, much lower budget--and usually horrid production values. you really can't fault the film makers--they just didn't have the money and resources available to the average film company. as a result, they had to make due with a lot less--including an over-reliance on stock actors that were seen again and again, no money for re-shooting scenes and a need to get the films done fast! this film tried very hard to be a black version of a gene autry film--starring herb jeffries instead. jeffries was a light-skinned man from mixed ancestry and he starred in several similar cowboy films. in each, he sings a little, fights a little (though very poorly) and loves a little--everything you need in a cowboy. believe it or not, jeffries is still alive at age 96.  the general plot was indiscernible from an autry picture--complete with anachronistic items such as telephones out west! the problem is that despite its similarities, the low budget shines through. stymie (from the li'l rascals) flubbed a few lines but they just left it in, the fight scenes were totally unchoreographed and were among the worst ever put on film, there were some odd plot holes, there was no background music (leaving the film strangely quiet) and the acting was pretty awful.  now this does not mean that the film isn't worth seeing--only that it abouts with technical problems that prevent it from being scored higher. one reviewer, oddly, scored this film a 10! how this can be with all the problems is beyond me. however, i can understand a person liking the film despite its many problems. the plot is generally pretty good, the characters likable, the musical numbers excellent and you know that the people making the film tried so darn hard and it's a very important piece of american history. but a 10!?   by the way, in an odd bit of casting, the very tall, lean and almost white-skinned jefferies is paired with short, dumpy and exceptionally dark mantan moreland....as his brother!! also, spencer williams may be familiar to you. he played andy on tv's ""amos 'n andy"".",0

"while it's early to say how the series will evolve, i can say that the pilot was less than i thought it would be. there is still potential for the series, however. of course when i first saw voyager i thought it had potential, too - but was sorely disappointed. my gut tells me enterprise won't be as bad as voyager, however.  as for the impressions of the pilot...  the pilot had some good ideas and good themes. i liked the introduction. the show's opening credits were interesting, with the progress of exploration and a fitting theme song. scott bakula is excellent in the role of captain.  where it fell short for me was largely that the story lacked the ""feel"" of setting out on a grand adventure. the plot of the episode itself was more a ""generic"" trek story with the themes of ""exploration"" and ""first step towards space"" merely subplot and subtext. were you to edit out the references to this being the first deep space mission, the plot would be hard to differentiate between the eras of enterprise, tos or tng. the central plot didn't reflect or do justice to the grand theme of the series.   the plot of launching the first mission would have been grand enough without the ""action"". instead of isolated references to the newness of exploration, they could have been the story. get a little more nostalgic and philosophical about it (oh, for a tv show that once again would make us think). make us feel the excitement of ""the wind"" and being on ""the sea"" instead of distracting us with a rescue and a plethora of gunplay. there was way too much gunplay.  we had the feeling more that humans were the ""freshmen"" in an established school. new kids on the block, as opposed to venturing into a largely unknown universe. sadly, the klingons landed on our doorstep instead of us finding them. that meeting could have been far more historic and far more sociological. just how do two such different societies interact? don't just hint about it, show it!  i had to think of it more as `trek with an akward crew and limited technology' as opposed to `the first brave steps into the unknown'. i wanted to see something newer and fresher. the series promises to have a new concept but so far i haven't seen this new, great concept.  i will conclude with reiterating the sentiment that the series has potential. there are some interesting characters. bakula is wonderful. blalock has potential. the overall theme is the most interesting since we first saw kirk in a world before apollo 11. if only future episodes can do justice to this grand and wonderful theme, we will have a show which will create new legends.  you shoot an arrow into the air... good luck capt. archer.  to the producers: take more risks and make us *think*! :-)",0
"i liked batman: dead end. a dark edgy film-noir setting for batman was perfect. batman: dead end is good. this is not.  first of all let me start off with the acting. none of it is really that good. the best would probably be clark bartram as batman. but that isn't saying much. he is good at first glance, and then you realize he is what he is, a body-builder who happens to be a tolerable actor. but mainly the problem is that batman doesn't belong in the daylight, he looks like a freak running around in a bat suit. instead of a horribly scarred man trying to make up for past mistakes. the daylight also reveals an irritating dorky scowl on bartram's face which never leaves and unoticeable in batman: dead end, probably because of the darkness of short which is so desired in this trailer. bartram seems to think that scowling and stubbornly shaking his head is acting, it's not, it's quite the opposite. it's called posing, something real actors avoid like the plague.  something i never understood why collora casted body-builders as the leads. it makes much more sense to give the role to an actor who can manage it, instead of a bodybuilder who can kinda manage it but hey he looks so much like the comic! of course, they might have done better if collora's dialouge didn't leave much to be desired.  the entire trailer (yes, trailer. there will not be a full-length film) is more centered around superman then batman. but everything on the superman side is corny, cloying and amateur. michael o'hearn (superman) is one of the worst actors i've ever seen. he stands around, smiles, says his lines. that's about it. although i'm not surprised since he is just a bodybuilder they hired and possibly received a few acting lessons. once again i say to collora, cast actors. not bodybuilders. actors will be so much more compelling that we will forgive the fact they don't look exactly like the comic book.  the costume is what you would expect superman to wear. as for the batman suit. well, i guess it only looks good in the dark. i say this because in some shots the suit looks like something you would buy from a halloween gift shop.  superman flies in this movie. but that isn't a good thing. these shots look especially amateur. this and a lot of the entire ""film"" looks like it was shot in their backyard with a vhs camera.  the best shots are a shot of superman catching a car in his hands. and the final shot of two-face and batman at the very end. for those of you who have seen the trailer. you know what i'm talking about. now if only he could have stretched that shot through the entire trailer.  finally i ask. why if you're trying to show your ability as a director, would you make a trailer as a short film? this proves nothing when it comes to being an actual director handling story. my only piece of advice for collora here is, there is a difference between the ability to tell a story and being able to work in marketing.  batman: dead end didn't feel amateur. i can't figure out where this went wrong.",0
"i absolutely hate this programme, what kind of people sit and watch this garbage?? ok my dad and mum love it lol but i make sure i'm well out of the room before it comes on. its so depressing and dreary but the worst thing about it is the acting i cant stand all detective programmes such as this because the detectives are so wooden and heartless. what happened to detective programmes with real mystery??? i mean who wants to know what happened to fictional characters we know nothing about that died over 20 years ago??? i wish the bbc would put more comedy on bbc1 cos now with the vicar of dibley finished there is more room for crap like this.",0
"the premise sucked me in, but it was clear about 30 seconds in that this was either david lynch or something seriously terrible. interesting to watch just to run through the fundamentalist laundry list. i can be a sucker for a stirring spiritual piece (romero comes to mind), but there was nothing spiritual whatsoever about this one. the message seems to be that we must all pretend we have an iq of 80 (or simply get a lobotomy - jennifer what happened to ya?) and blindly follow the bible without any sort of self-examination whatsoever or we'll trigger the second coming. it's the kind of attitude that makes people fly jumbo jets into 110 story buildings (i work around the corner from the site of the former wtc). i like to think that god is a little greater than that.",0
"the bourne ultimatum is the third and final outing for super-spy jason bourne, a man who is out to kill the people who made him into a killer. the bourne series is one of the highest regarded trilogies by critics (ultimatum has an 85/100 on metacritic.com, meaning it's status is ""universal acclaim) and for good reason- the fighting is choreographed very well and the deep story can be very engrossing.  first, i highly advise you watch the bourne identity and the bourne supremacy, the two fancy-titled prequels to ultimatum. there may be three different movies, but in reality they are all a continuance of one another: missing one leaves you stranded and confused, just like i was. you will still be about to enjoy the action and fight scenes of ultimatum if you missed the first two, but then the story will definitely lead to some confusion.  if you were lucky enough to view the prequels to this movie, you probably had a treat watching bourne take down his enemies and track down the man who screwed him from supremacy. jason bourne is played very well by mattdamon. damon does nothing to deserve an oscar nod, but his work here is good enough to hold it's own. bourne's adventures take place in many different cities; the cities are all varied enough to keep the movie from becoming bland at times. the agency tracking bourne takes advantage of every technological tool known to mankind to track him down.  i won't go into detail on the characters because they are continuations off of the first two movies. however, it wouldn't hurt the movie to spell a few things out for the audience- not every viewer is a die-hard movie watcher who can pick up on every little hint about story development. ultimatum wouldn't have been harmed at all if the story was a little more up front.  it seems most people agree that ultimatum was a success of a film: the movie opened to $69 million, and -box office total now is up to $216 mil- is currently still going very strongly for a movie that has been in theatres since august 3. it's the best action movie i've seen since live free or die hard.  good) damon is solid but not spectacular, very smart movie bad) story is like many others",1

"well i'll start with the good points. the movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of it was so bad it was funny. now for the low points. my first warning sign came with an actual ""warning"" on the film. when it started the following ""warning"" was displayed: ""the film you are about to see contains graphic and disturbing images. because contrary to popular belief being killed is neither fun, pretty or romantic."" i should have saved myself the 86 minutes and turned it off then. the first words of the film were: ""i'm at the glue factory."" it was some guy talking on his phone, and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. i don't know why. so the basis of the movie is some kid is obsessed with the zodiac killer and starts imitating him. the budget for this film was at least 50 bucks and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. the acting was worse than me reading straight from a script. that's what is looked like they were doing. the script was horrible, and the big ""twist"" was that this guy who wrote a biography on the zodiac killer was actually the zodiac killer. of course they tried to show this subtly but made it totally obvious within the first 10 minutes. without any more painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. they try to make the zodiac killer compare himself to an ""army of one"" because soldiers are really just murderers. then they tried to make an attempt at ""satanic worship"" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting. the great ""computer hacker"" was able to get this kid's address when someone gave him the kid's name and phone number. for some reason he had to hack into the fbi to get someone address. i'm not sure why he didn't just look it up in the phone book or use whitepages.com. there was also a random allusion to 9/11 for no reason. i also learned that no matter where you get shot, blood will come out of your mouth within seconds.  so if you like really bad acting, sub-par scripts, bad camera work and an obvious plot, you'll love zodiac killer!",0

"as a huge fan of only the first 2 seasons of bsg and the stand alone feature bsg razor i was hoping that this release would return the franchise to its original glory days. usually i have no problem with science fiction that is mostly dialog driven as opposed to a visual bonanza of special effects. if the script is tight with some original ideas delivered by good actors one can create a profound film with little cgi money spent. this prequel has none of those aforementioned requirements going for it. the virtual reality world created by the terrorist teenagers was both ridiculous & unbelievable. this scene was simply put there to raise the release rating to restricted. not that teens don't love virtual reality mosh pits filled with sex & violence & heavy dance music. its the part about those same teens having the intellectual depth & reason or political & religious passion as to create such futuristic software or become suicide bombers that perplexes me. these kids are definitely not from this planet. the movie plays out like a soap opera with only the last 10 minutes being slightly interesting. the scene with eric stolz giving his cyborg a devine conscienceness via the student firmware upgrade was amusing if not entertaining. but this old concept was far better portrayed & much more believable in the brilliant, classic original ""frankenstein"" with boris karloff. caprica rips off its only interesting idea from an old hollywood horror film. no surprise there! overall this movie was bland & unoriginal & cheap looking, using recycled cgi of caprica from bsg. i doubt i'll be watching this space soap when it premieres on the sci-fi channel. unless of course i happen to be suffering from a bad bout of insomnia at which time this show would definitely be the cure. zzzzzzzz",0

"sky captain is possibly the best awful movie i've seen in a long while. rife with amazing cg and special effects, studded with an a-list cast (jude law, gwyneth paltrow, angelina jolie and the infinitely likable giovanni ribisi) and racing along with an overused but indiana jones-esquire storyline, this should have been a great movie to watch.  'should have' being the key term here, of course.  jude law plays joe the sky captain with a dashing accent and plenty of over-the-shoulder, heart-melting smirks, but you can't make something out of nothing, and even his flippant deliveries and boyish good looks can't save the movie's stone dialogue. (if he had slapped giovanni ribisi on the back and said, ""good boy, dex,"" just one more time, i might have barfed all over the guy in front of me.) gwyneth paltrow, as polly perkins, is nothing less than nerve grating. her nasal whining and not-quite-sarcastic comments get old in the first ten minutes of the movie. perhaps she put too much effort into playing the stereotypical 30's comic book heroine- who knows? i expected more from her. an example of how a similar character was played (and played well) is in the late 90's flick ""the phantom,"" starring kristy swanson and billy zane. rent the movie and you'll know what i mean.  giovanni ribisi and angelina jolie were the saving graces in the film. (angelina jolie was incredibly hot in that eyepatch. i'll admit it.) in just a few short scenes, both actors somehow managed to rise above the tired material and deliver a more riveting performance than their dry, two-dimensional castmates.  the plot and steady story progression were old, boring, and basically just a monotonous combination of every good scene from an action movie in the past thirty years. the pace is rapid-fire in the first half of the movie, and a snail's pace in the second, giving the audience enough time not only to guess the eventual conclusion of the film, but to figure out who the key villain is as well. the pairing is rather clichéd, also- polly perkins and sky captain apparently reunite after several years of separation from a bitterly-ended romance, and their story isn't so much charming and eclectic as it is annoying and mismatched. when they finally come to terms with their mutual feelings towards the end of the film, nobody's surprised, and nobody really cares either.  props to the director for appreciating bai ling enough to dress her in skintight vinyl for the entirety of the film, and also for the intriguing sepia tones that served as coloration throughout. but sky captain, despite having all the essential elements of being a great movie, falls flat on its face. not even worth the $2.75 i paid to get into the theater.",0

"""cinema is dead, long live the cinema!"" said peter greenaway, one of the most innovative and productive contemporary directors, at the last year's romanian film festival anonimul, which got to the third edition and takes place in the danube delta. this year the direction prize went to jafar panahi's ""offside"". i got to see it this evening in bucharest at the festival's retrospective. cinema is dead but still very lively. panahi's film tells in a compelling manner how iranian society looks. digitally filmed, ""offside"" is a story inspired by a real-life event happened to panahi's daughter: the trouble and risk took when decided to attend a football match. this is forbidden in iran as we are informed. what panahi manages to do is to render with few means, but with, probably, a lot of work, intelligence and humor the cultural patterns in a society that places women at a distinct level. the absurdity of the laws becomes comical. the film has a happy end, after all because iran's team goes to the world cup. what i appreciated most was the concept, the idea behind this film. i would be very interested to see panahi's other films that were forbidden in iran as well. i guess that he can be thought as an activist director.",1

"i have two good things to say about this film: the scenery is beautiful and peter falk gives a good performance (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialog and direction). however, that said, i found this film extremely tiresome. watching paint dry would have been more entertaining. it seemed much longer than 97 minutes. beginning with opening sequence, where everyone is talking over each other and paul reiser is repeating everything that's said to him on the phone, the movie is annoying. the film is filled with clichés and shtick, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence by falk. also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughs or tears. there are some sequences that are touching, but they're all played for laughs. if schmaltzy, sentimental, and ""cute"" appeal to you, you'll love it. but if you were hoping for something with more substance, see a different movie.",0
"many reviews i've read reveals that most people tend to like part one better than part two. i feel exactly the opposite. part one played around a bit much with trying to find different ways of showing che guevara's personality through different types of film stock, different locations, and cutting back and forth between an interview and the cuban revolution. for the most part it was structured finely but somewhat distracting. in part two, che enters bolivia, and along with changing geographical location, the rules and the structure changes. gone are the spacial jumps and switching between stocks, the ""documentary realism"" and the treatises. instead, now we are literally trapped with che in a desaturated, depopulated landscape where the only people who exist are burdened too far with their lives for anything but survival to be an option. i posit that it's the dark turn of che's life that is the real reason why most people prefer part one to part two.  the change in geographic location also signifies, for me at least, that che: part one and che: part two are, in fact, the second two acts of a three act structure begun by motorcycle diaries. motorcycle diaries is che's coming-of-age (or more appropriately, coming-of-ideals) in argentina, che: part one is his military leadership in cuba, and che: part two is his downfall in bolivia. these movies do not completely illustrate his life (we're missing his experiences in guatamala and, more importantly in my opinion, his post-cuban revolution executions), but they create a very detailed exploration into the controversial aspects of his character and nature as worldwide symbol. he both symbolizes the idealism and need for armed resistance to oppression, and revolutionary failings in the post-world war ii third world countries and their hindering by such activities as, um, the cias meddling.  but, yet again, all of that is projected on-screen in this case not through long scenes of dialog and speeches, but through a much more intimate, suffering portrayal of che at the end of his thread and his life. again, the rules have changed, and in this case it's hard to tell if there was any chance of success at all. the number of times the camera shows people literally trapped between a rock and a hard place and the desaturated, shaky long takes involves the audience into the narrative of people imprisoned in a hostile landscape, an existential hell, where revolutionary beliefs ultimately end up taking second tier to the desperation of hunted people starving to death. it's just not that easy of a movie to watch, but it's very effective.  --polarisdib",1
"i first saw this movie back in the early '90's when it was first released. room with a view was also newly out. enchanted april had so much more to offer! i found it much more real and earthy, the characters more believable for being 'normal'. by the end of the film i felt the same as i did when i first saw the bbc production of pride and prejudice, i was yearning for the characters to find what they were looking for whether it was isolation, peace, liberty or love. you get a sense throughout that italy is so far removed from everything they have ever known, that they are so decadent for taking a risk and leaving behind all that is humdrum and constricting. but in the heat of the spring in april, everyone's lives loosen and unravel (in line with the victorian corsets) and are slowly rebuilt to everyone's satisfaction. what a little gem of a film! how come it isn't more well known?",1
"after what was considered to be the official dirty harry trilogy with the enforcer(1976) to be the final chapter in the series. dirty harry is back, older, more dirtier and grittier than ever since the original 1971 classic.  dirty harry in the past has killed a psychopath killer, vigilante cops, and vietnam veteran terrorists. but now he's after a new killer, a killer who wants payback, by gunning down her attackers.  sudden impact brings a new meaning and more darker tone to dirty harry. callahan is on a new murder case that is circling back to a woman(played by sondra locke), who was brutally raped, along with her sister, who is left traumitized. ten years after, she's out for revenge by gunning down her attackers. at the same though callahan is on a heat of trouble by his superiors after he provokes a mob boss to a heart attack, of which the mob are hunting him as well. so in order to let the heat die down within the city, harry is on order to take a vacation on a seaside town, but at the same time the raped victim is in town as well, while hunting her attackers one by one. harry is on the investigation and finds the killings very similar, as he homes in on the killer's trails.  sudden impact in my opinion, has to be one of my top 10 revenge films, as well as being the second best dirty harry movie yet, far better than both the enforcer and the dead pool combined. sudden impact has what the original dirty harry had, a dark tone with entertaining value.  so do you feel lucky, punk?",1
"this movie tries hard, but completely lacks the fun of the 1960s tv series, that i am sure people do remember with fondness. although i am 17, i watched some of the series on youtube a long time ago and it was enjoyable and fun. sadly, this movie does little justice to the series.  the special effects are rather substandard, and this wasn't helped by the flat camera-work. the script also was dull and lacked any sense of wonder and humour. other films with under-par scripting are home alone 4, cat in the hat, thomas and the magic railroad and addams family reunion.  now i will say i liked the idea of the story, but unfortunately it was badly executed and ran out of steam far too early, and i am honestly not sure for this reason this is something for the family to enjoy. and i was annoyed by the talking suit, despite spirited voice work from wayne knight.  but the thing that angered me most about this movie was that it wasted the talents of christopher lloyd, jeff daniels and daryl hannah, all very talented actors. jeff daniels has pulled off some good performances before, but he didn't seem to have a clue what he was supposed to be doing, and elizabeth hurley's character sadly came across as useless. daryl hannah is a lovely actress and generally ignored, and i liked the idea of her being the love interest, but sadly you see very little of her,(not to mention the monster attack is likely to scare children than enthrall them) likewise with wallace shawn as some kind of government operative. christopher lloyd acquits himself better, and as an actor i like lloyd a lot(he was in two of my favourite films clue and who framed roger rabbit, and i am fond of back to the future) but he was given little to work with, and had a tendency to overact quite wildly.  overall, as much i wanted to like this movie, i was left unimpressed. instead of being fun, it came across as pointless, and that is a shame because it had a lot of potential, with some talented actors and a good idea, but wasted with poor execution. 1/10 bethany cox",0
"i saw an interview with rob schneider (who plays the lead character, marvin mange, in this film.) he said in it that he wanted to emphasize physical comedy here so much that even if you had the volume turned off you'd be laughing at this movie. obviously that must be the secret. i had the volume turned up. i was actually listening to this thing and thought it was a disaster, and completely unfunny - a major disappointment after schneider's hilarious performance in ""deuce bigalow, male gigolo.""  the story is stupid: mange is a major loser who dreams of being a cop who gets filled with a bunch of animal transplants after a car accident by a mad scientist type appropriately named dr. wilder (michael caton), and as a result starts to lose control of his ""animal instincts."" this makes him a ""supercop."" he can sniff out drugs hidden in body cavities and outrun horses. of course, he also has a nasty habit of eating people's cows and trying to seduce their goats, but surely that's a small price to pay? it just didn't do anything for me.   the cast left much to be desired. is there a more irritating actor in all of hollywood than john mcginley? here, he plays sgt. sisk, mange's commander on the police force, as a repugnantly cartoonish character (much the same as his doctor character in the inexplicably popular tv series ""scrubs."") i was anxious to get a look at colleen haskell's first ""serious"" acting job (can anything in this movie be called ""serious?"") she, of course, gained her fame as a contestant on the first ""survivor"" and she proves here what we knew from that: she's cute as a button. what she doesn't prove here is that she has any discernible talent as an actress. and what's with ed asner as police chief wilson. i mean, how old is this guy now? he's the size of some of the cows mange tried to eat, and he seemed out of breath the whole way through. i'm surprised he made it through the filming. there's a brief cameo at the end by adam sandler (who also served as executive producer of this.)  anyway, i chuckled twice: mange playing with his squeaky toys in the police car, and the scene schneider has with haskell and the orangutan - the orangutan has more acting talent! so, for two chuckles - 2/10.",0

"the film is not visually stunning in the conventional sense. it doesn't present a series of pretty pictures. instead it is a visually interesting film. it forces the viewer to constantly process or perhaps imagine the context of the various shots. this sort of thing is easy to try but hard to succeed at. the film refuses to use the crutch of a genre to help the less than fully engaged viewer get what's going on. instead the film touches on and moves through a number of different genres. the trick to loving the film is being able to enjoy this playfulness. i suspect 99% of north american viewers will just not get it. if you try to pin down the narrative of this film, or the philosophical message, or the symbolist structure, etc. you will waste your time. there are none of these. the film only feints towards these genres and others at times. the only unifying force in the film is claire denis's own sense of what fits together. there are so few feature length films that come close to satisfying kant's description of what art is, namely the enjoyment of the power of judgment itself instead of simply subsuming experiences under concepts. film usually takes the easy way out and opts for the simpler pleasure of understanding what's happening. most film is not art. most film doesn't come close to art. when a film does, as this one does, and is still enjoyable by a large range of viewers, it's something of a miracle. my on negative comment is that at times i find the film too simplistically buying in to the various narrative threads that run through it. the tahiti father-son narrative, even though it's not exactly conventional, ends up making things a little to clear and simple. it dominates too much.",1
"if you like jamie foxx,(alvin sanders),""date from hell"",'01, you will love his acting as a guy who never gets an even break in life and winds up messing around with shrimp, (jumbo size) and at the same time lots of gold bars. alvin sanders has plenty of fbi eyes watching him and winds up getting hit by a brick in the jaw, and david morse,(edgar clenteen), ""hack"" '02 tv series, decides to zero in on poor alvin and use him as a so called fish hook to attract the criminals. there is lots of laughs, drama, cold blood killings and excellent film locations and plenty of expensive cars being sent to the junk yard. jamie foxx and david morse were outstanding actors in this film and it was great entertainment through out the entire picture.",1
"any film which begins with a cowhand shagging a female calf can't promise much. as for the stereotyping of the kibbutz as it was 50 yrs ago, well i was there and it just wasn't like that. ok every kibbutz had just a small piece of something shown in the film (like youngsters raiding the kitchen at night) but you can't show the whole kibbutz as being full of all those - shall we say - naughty traits. each kibbutz had its own problems, but hardly any kibbutz had all of them. the views of israel were great. i still remember my youth in that garden of eden called the emek (valley). yes, and the acting was good too, so you see it wasn't all black - just a wrong portrayal - probably on purpose too.",0
"in hazzard county, georgia, cousins bo and luke duke (scott, knoxville) and their cousin daisy duke (jessica simpson) run moonshine made by their uncle jesse (willie nelson) while avoiding the local authority, boss hog (burt reynolds). their problems with the boss are only beginning as they learn he's been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below it.  i have never seen the tv show and after watching the movie, i'm not going to start any time soon. i like stupid comedies but this one didn't offer many laughs. it was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through. the second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity. the film focused on bo and luke way too much. the characters in general weren't very interesting and the actors portraying them didn't do a very good job.  the acting wasn't very good. i wasn't expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny. seann william scott and johnny knoxville both give below average performances. the latter was pretty good as stifler but he tries way too hard here. the latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else. jessica simpson isn't known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing. she's famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things. she is pretty but she's a weak actor. it doesn't matter though because she doesn't really appear in the movie and the character she plays isn't complex or anything. willie nelson also has a minor role and he doesn't do anything special.  the screenplay was written by john o'brien and he made two films prior to the dukes of hazzard. the first one was cradle to the grave, which was okay. the second one was starsky and hutch which was pretty funny. he doesn't do a good job here though as the story is a mess. he also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better. the movie is also pretty long for a comedy. okay, 106 minutes isn't exactly long but it feels so much longer because there's very little humor in the first hour. i think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time. the dukes of hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes. the car sequences were average and they don't save an already troubled film. in the end, dukes of hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and it's better if you just skip it. rating 4/10",0

"the premise of this movie is revealed on the dvd box. a textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesn't degrade. but the movie fails to get on with it. instead it pads for 45 minutes, noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery. since audiences don't benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out, it's a strange choice: the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic. once the fabric is discovered, the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs, and blue-collar co-workers want the invention squelched, leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements; inventing the chemical, and running from oppressors.  i can't understand why anyone would describe this as comedy. the tone isn't funny or comical. it's more like serious social criticism of the day: that capitalism warps both supply chains and production. which in turn prevents innovation from reaching and improving the world. yes, that's probably true, but without some toying with an attitude towards that fact, the movie is simply an earnest argument. you'll need an extremely broad definition of comedy to find any here.  this is more like a british meet john doe (meet nigel doe ?).",0
"reading a wide variety of ""scoop"" reviews over the past few days, i walked into the theater prepared for a subpar outing from woody. happily, i couldn't have been more wrong. granted, woody the performer is slowing down a touch or two, but woody the writer/director is in fine form - and found a credible way to integrate his 70-year old self into the story. judging from the laughter and guffaws, the audience ate up allen's one-liners and dialogue in a way that i haven't seen in several years.   in a movie landscape dominated by software-approved story arcs, twentysomething tastes and assembly-line formula fare for kiddies, it's a source of both satisfaction and inspiration to see allen pursuing his highly personal and still-rewarding path.",1
"and this is a great rock'n'roll movie in itself. no matter how it evolved (at point being a movie about disco), it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out, but the principal stands in their way. think back to those rock'n'roll movies of the 50's in which the day is saved when alan freed comes to town with chuck berry to prove that rock & roll music is really cool and safe for the kids, and tuesday weld gets a new sweater for the dance. forward to the 1979, repeat the same plot, but throw in da ramones, whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the next quarter century (and then for the obligatory dj guest shot, ""the real"" don steele). throw in, too, all the elements of a roger corman-produced comedy-exploitation film, except for the two-day shooting schedule, some of the familiar corman repertory players like clint howard, mary wournow and dick miller (there since ""bucket of blood""), and you've got one of the great stoopid movies of the day. one of the few films that uses deliberate cheesiness and gets away with it. i showed the new dvd to a friend who could only remember seeing parts of it through a stoner- induced haze at the drive-in, and he agreed that this is one of the great movies to be watching drunk, not the least for the lovely leading ladies and the great ramones footage.",1
"my girlfriend and i were stunned by how bad this film was. after 15 minutes we would have called it quits except we were too curious to see if the film could possibly redeem itself. it didn't.  i can't understand the praise given to this film. the writing was downright awful and delivered by some of the worst acting i have seen in a very long time.  one thing that especially annoyed me about this film was that often when people were talking to each other there was an unnatural pause between lines. i understand using a pause to create a feeling of awkwardness (like in happiness). this was not that type of pause -- it was just simply bad directing. this film might actually be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this film, because then the innane dialogue and bad acting wouldn't be noticed as much.  i generally like these types of small quirky films (the real blonde, walking and talking, lovely and amazing), but this one failed on so many levels that i consider it one of the very worst films i have sat through in the last few years.",0
"after finally viewing this movie in its entirety, i am completely mystified by the adoration it has received by critics and online users alike. is it the worst western ever? no, i wouldn't say that. but ""the last great american western"", a phrase i saw applied to it more than once? not even close.  a movie that tries to tell a story like this needs believable characters that speak believable dialogue, and the dialogue in this film is among the most hackneyed and clichéd that i've ever seen. the movie can be measured in groaners per minute; as in, how many times is an actor or actress forced by the script to say something that no human being would say in real life? there's so many instances of this that it's distracting. cheesy lines come at you in waves; predictable, unoriginal, and often.   if bad dialogue doesn't bother you, then how about bad gunfights? few westerns can show you gunfighting that's completely unbelievable while desperately trying to make you take the action seriously. it's okay if there's a comic edge to such gunfighting, such as in silverado, but in tombstone the very staged and very stiff choreography of the early gunplay is just another reason to leave this movie off the list of good westerns. the final showdown somewhat redeems the director on this score, but by then, i was so disinterested in the movie that it was beyond saving.  other than those flaws, i can say the visuals are stunning - the movie's well shot and the settings all look great. the acting is passable, especially considering what the actors were given to work with. however, if you're looking for the last great american western, do yourself a favor - go rent unforgiven instead.  3 out of 10",0

"this was one of the worst movies i've ever seen. i'm still not sure if it was serious, or just a satire. one of those movies that uses every stupid who dunnit cliché they can think of. arrrrgh.  don johnson was pretty good in it actually. but otherwise it sucked. it was over 10 years ago that i saw it, but it still hurts and won't stop lingering in my brain.   the last line in the movie really sums up how stupid it is. i won't ruin it for you, should you want to tempt fate by viewing this movie. but i garantee you a *nghya* moment at the end, with a few in between. if you have nothing better to do, and you like to point and laugh, then maybe it might be worth your while. additionally, if you're forced to go on a date with someone you really don't like, suggest watching this movie together, and they'll probably leave you alone after they see it. that's a fair price to pay, i guess.",0
"four porn stars romping through the irish woods sounds like a film to watch. we have ginger lynn allen, chasey lain, taylor hayes, and jenna jameson all together in one film. are you licking your lips? well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victims.  yes, there was some flesh exposed - far too little considering the cast - but, it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures. there was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before, and more than one person lost their head in the situation.  unfortunately, director christian viel did not show much promise and i am not likely to watch his later efforts.",0
"indeed: drug use, warehouse shoot-'em-ups, 'matrix'-esque bullet dodging, a futuristic city with a mix of asian races, and a lonely vampire --all in the same movie-- seems like a story that could only be envisioned by a japanese pop/rock star. and that is exactly what 'moon child' is, and more. while all these elements combined may sound like the perfect subject for a campy b-movie of the week, 'moon child' pulls it off with but a few expected bumps and hitches along the way.  the film has a gritty, definitely independent feel to it, jumping from one scene to the next not in smooth transition, but rather sporadic leaps and bounds, giving glimpses into the characters' lives and barely scraping at a true plot. but the film makes no excuses, instead turning the story into one of friendship, love, trust, and betrayal all sugar-coated in the aforementioned elements of a futuristic society, warring gangsters, and vampires.  hyde as the somber vampire 'kei' is excellent, giving depth to the character and balancing-out the overly-zealous acting of gackt as 'sho,' an orphan who befriends kei. lee-hom wang also shines as the vengeful 'son' who becomes friends with a grown-up sho. the story revolves around these characters and their extended friends and family through different periods in their lives, and how simple friendship can so easily be turned into grief and betrayal.  while the action at times is all-too unrealistic and special effects appear just to show-off, one thing the film never does is presume to be about the immensely popular asian singers it features. the superstars as actors have their flaws, and so do their characters. the movie rarely gets boring, and ends where it should, after jumping about quite a bit. 'moon child' is rather enjoyable, humorous at times, and even very touching: it is definitely worth your time!",1
"my god. this movie was awful. i can't complain about it too much. i went to see it just to be grossed out. it did suffice, sort of. it's funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very, very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated baby.  i also think that it's funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the hispanic soldier, who was a supporting actor in next friday. everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job. it was some of the worst acting i've ever paid to see.   i also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one. it wasn't. i expected it to be more gruesome because it's a sequel and horror movie sequels are usually much less successful than their predecessors. i expected it to be more gruesome since gore and violence usually sell a horror movie these days (grudge 2, saw 3, jeepers creepers 1 & 2, dead silence), but it actually wasn't nearly as gruesome as the first one, which was yet another disappointment.   the mutants in the first one were kind of disturbing but the filmmakers were trying so hard in this one to make them creepy that they were absolutely hilarious.  i also hated the entire concept of showing the clip of the female soldier's son on her camera-phone saying ""i love you, mommy"" four times. it was stupid to show it in the first place because they were just trying to make us feel worse for the vulnerable mother than the rest of the soldiers, and it was even more stupid to keep trying to make us feel even worse for her by showing it three more times for no reason. this movie was a joke.",0

"........and an extremely bad one at that!!! how long did this train-wreck last?? 14 episodes or something?? i can see why now.  i bought the ""serenity"" episode from amazon unboxed. it was my first purchase, so was free. that is the only good thing about the experience (incident??)  i won't comment really on the acting, since these were, i guess, fairly new people who hadn't really gotten the job down just right yet. at least i've never seen them before in any type of major show, theater or tv. if i did, then i have easily forgotten them.  but the special effects were absolutely horrendous. true, this isn't exactly a multi-million $$ project, but the original star trek did better than this & that was thirty-five years ago. i especially got a laugh out of the bad guys (reapers or something like that) ship as it chased the hilarious looking firefly, with smoke coming out of the engines looking something like a gigantic model rocket. i fully expected to eventually see the wiley coyote riding on top, while chasing after the roadrunner. modern jet/rocket engines don't even do it that bad.  and that wasn't even the worst of it. the wild-west type shoot-outs had me wondering if i was actually watching a sci-fi film or a gene autry one.  regardless of the hype, don't waste your time...i did...all 80-something minutes of the disaster called ""firefly"".",0
"i read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about liebe des totes (the love of the dead) or something similar. this of course awoke my curiosity so i ordered nekromantik 1 & 2 and der todesking (the death king). the nekromantik movies are ok, even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject necrophilia (even if they obviously are horror-opera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind, they are actually quite funny.)  todesking, on the other hand is, in my opinion, one of the best films ever made. it consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death. death as an enemy; death as a reliever, death as the very fysical decomposition of the body. the film is a metaphor over life. it shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are. it reduces its viewers to the childs they (we) actually are. the fact that we cannot really understand the nature of death, and hence neither the process of dying, is the core message of the film. this is a most realistic film. never does buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever. no matter what moral standards you set up, death is unevitable, and will sooner or later be not a fiction but your reality. this applies to you, dear reader, like it applies to the viewers of the film. some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this, which is fully excused, since they of course will live forever...  this is no exploitation movie. why? because death does not exploit us humans. it harvests us. we grow for seven days, then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of pre-birth, that is death. buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales. whether you choose to regard it as ""optimistic"" or ""pessimistic"" is up to you. at first glance it may seem very dark. consider though, that in order for something to live, something else must die. ""who wants to live forever?""  i believe that when buttgereit shows a body, that are being consumed by maggots, he shows not only decomposition, but generation of new life. is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil, than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genre?  when you realize this, you see der todesking it its right context.  sieben tage hat die woche, siebenmal letzte stunden. seven are the days of week (weak, mortal !), seven times the last hour.  dont fear the reaper, buttgereit tells us, because the reaper takes only what is ripe. and apples that are not plucked for food will rot!  have a good life, fellow imdb'ers !

"the story concerns a genealogy researcher (mel harris) who is hired by her estee lauder-like cosmetic queen aunt. her aunt (by marriage we are left to presume) is trying to track down her long lost family in europe. all they have to go on is a photo of a young girl standing by an ornate music box. the researcher heads to europe and conducts her search in places like milan, budapest, and vienna. the scenery is the real thing and is actually shot on location (unlike a murder, she wrote where jessica is supposed to be visiting a far-flung locale and lansbury never left burbank). anyway, she meets a young man who is also searching to solve a family mystery of his own and they team up to track down clues and menace bad guys. the dialogue, particularly the romantic dialogue, is terrible. i watched this because of the scenery but the script was so bad that i stayed on just to see if it would get worse. it did. acting was also off. i can see why mel harris's career never really took off after thirtysomething, but she is adequate (seems too old for her co-star though). but, the supporting players are straight out of the community playhouse. i also lost count of how many times they say ""budapest"" to each other. yes, it is pronounced bood-a-phesht. we know, okay? i realized halfway into the film that this had to be one of those harlequin movies and sure enough it is. guess that says it all.",0
"i won't argue with anyone who pronounces this film execrable, as is january jones's performance, but please check her out, if you haven't already, in the amc tv series 'mad men,"" starting later this month. she's excellent, as is the entire cast. i'll charitably assume she took on the ""taboo"" role strictly for the money, and, realizing what a putrid mess it was going to be, turned in a minimal acting job to avoid starvation. don't know if that's the case, but i (now) know for sure that she can act.  at first, watching ""taboo,"" i was convinced her flat delivery was a shrewd choice that would later give rise to some significant revelation about her character or the plot. no such luck. hard to believe the director didn't suggest to her at least once that not changing expression for 17 successive scenes could cause lockjaw.  ironically, her winning performance in ""mad men"" comes as a character who, at least in her early appearances, is very repressed, reserved, unsure of herself, and rather colorless, not unlike her ""taboo"" role. but as the tv series progressed, she began to blossom into someone who questions her traditional early-60's whitebread mom role. can't wait to see where they take her character in the 2nd season.  to sum up, avoid ""taboo"" like leprosy, but definitely check out ""mad men.""",0
"at first i had the reaction a lot of people left with after seeing this: that shots of fat people sunbathing, etc were cheap shots in a way. ok so he's doing diane arbus meets. . . whatever. . . but it wasn't long before i realized that this wasn't being done in a dehumanizing way, as the images unfold i felt that the problem was entirely the audience's: we are conditioned by hollywood and also movies from just about everywhere actually to feel that to watch people above a certain age behave in a sexual way is something unseemly, something that ought not to be shown. if this were all the film offered it would be a great deal. however, the story of the woman with the abusive boyfriend and his drunk friend really hits like a ton of bricks: very eloquent storytelling, incredible performances, and to think the scene was improvised. that blonde guy is a genius actor. finally i want to contradict those who say this film is all about how pathetic all these people are. the old man who is on the make with the woman who finally dances for him is completely an a ok character that breaks that mold, so don't oversimplify the film by overlooking him. yes his dog gets killed. this ain't a rosy picture of the world but it's not . . . completely hopeless. anyway i felt really grateful to the filmmaker for making such a beautiful film all in all. i wouldn't say each of the threads were as strong as the strongest, but i say this movie basically kicks ass and would highly recommend it. . .",1
"this movie is amazing! while being funny and entertaining, it is also profoundly deep and eye-opening. i will watch it again and again. bruce is a guy who is unhappy with his life. he has a job and a life, but it isn't what he thinks it will take to bring him happiness. bruce is bitter, unsatisfied, and resentful that his life isn't the way he envisions it should be. as a result of this state of mind, bruce ends up losing his job and blaming god for everything that he thinks is wrong with his life. god comes to bruce and grants him godly powers. bruce uses these powers to get everything he has always wanted. his life is finally exactly what he envisioned it would take to make him happy.....with one exception. in the process of gaining everything, he loses the one person who truly loved him. as the movie unfolds, bruce learns that the real change that needed to occur in his life was not the circumstances, but his perception of what was truly there. this movie was inspirational and deep. if you really pay attention, it forces you to look at your life with a deeply humbling respect for the fact that a lot of the time we are so much more blessed than we recognize. as my wife says, ""since when does anybody know what it takes to make them happy?"" and my humble addition, ""may we not lose ourselves and those who matter while we try to find out.""",1
"apparently there's a very good reason why i never heard about ""dr. hackenstein"" before me and a couple of mates accidentally stumbled upon it and stupidly decided to give it a chance. that reason is: it sucks! it's a very pointless, dull, imbecilic and totally unmemorable horror comedy/parody. actually, to be honest, i'm not even sure if this was meant as a comedy because sometimes the script takes itself quite seriously and tries really hard to be a really ambitious and original late 80's horror effort. in the year 1909, at the dawn of a new era in medical science according to the opening sequences, dr. elliot hackenstein needs exactly three women  no more, no less  to refurbish his beloved wife whom he accidentally killed. she's only just a living head left now, but the stupid body snatchers only provide male cadavers. so when dr. hackenstein yells out ""i need three female bodies to bring back my wife"", his words aren't even cold and there just miraculously appear three young females (and one really annoying nerdy kid) with car trouble show up at his doorstep. why doesn't that ever happen to me? ""i need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill up my empty harem!!!""  see, nothing! anyway, the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately  for science that is  he develops sympathy for one of the three girls. ""dr. hackenstein"" is a lame film that tries to cash in on the success of ""re-animator"" and even blatantly steal some of the comical aspects of that classic, like a severed head talking one-liners. it's easy to see why this film is never mentioned anywhere, as it doesn't appeal to fans of neither the horror nor the comedy genre. the funniest character is undoubtedly the loud-speaking female grave robber ruby; depicted by the anti-cherubic anne ramsey. 80's horror buffs will certainly remember her from wes craven's ""deadly friend"", where she played the nasty old hag neighbor who gets decapitated by a basketball. ""dr. hackenstein"" supposedly takes place in the early 1900's, but there are hardly any attempts to re-create the atmosphere of that era (except maybe for some automobiles). dr. hackenstein's laboratory is a quite clichéd 80's set piece, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors.",0

"savage island (2003) is a lame movie. it's more like a home video shot with very minimal lighting and horrid acting. not only that the storyline and script was wretched. i don't know why this movie was made. i have seen a lot of flicks in my time and the ones i really hate are movies that make me angry. this one made my blood boil. the situations were inane at best. if i made a movie like this it would have been a short. really because those backwood ""idjits"" wouldn't have been in the picture.  don't be fooled by the cover on the d.v.d. i am an avid watcher of bad cinema. but this movie is virtually unwatchable. i don't mind movies being shot on d.v. but if you're going to do that make the movie enjoyable, not some tired retread of superior horror films (sans wrong turn).  i have to not recommend this waste of disk. if you come across this one in the rental store pass on by.  movies that make yours truly angry get an automatic 1.",0
"this film is shockingly underrated on imdb. like so many films, this isn't shawshank. but it's a reasonably good, if predictable, dance competition / personal growth film. if you want to spend an hour and a half watching a sort of 8 mile for a female step dancer, than i think you'll like it.  judging from the imdb ratings, my guess is that this movie was approaching the top 250, and was ""vote bombed"" with many 1s, as happens to so many films that aren't about the mob, don't have special effects, or include non-white or non-straight characters.  it's an american film, but it's not a us film. set mostly in toronto the cues are subtle, and some audiences may think it's set entirely in the us just because the final competition is in the border city of detroit.  i liked the music. i liked the dance (but not convinced it's worth $50,000 ... but what do i know). the characters were easy on the eyes.  i do agree the title sucks. i don't remember anyone in the film saying those words, and it should have an ""s"". (no, it's not a foreign language).  there's not a lot to hate about this film (and let's be honest, a vote of 1 means you hated it) so i can only assume that it's an expression of hate for the kind of people in it, and that's sad.",1

"greetings again from the darkness. stunning photography highlights this disney documentary and provides a glimpse into some of the harshness of animals that live in the wilderness. for anyone over 40, disney and mutual of omaha's wild kingdom provided much of our insight into wild animals since our childhood ... back when there was no channel dedicated to national geographic or nature or animal planet.  what always fascinates is just how difficult the circumstances are for many of these majestic creatures. watching the elephants trudge for days, nearly delirious from lack of water, is oh so painful. but their nighttime battle against the lions is thrilling.  some of the underwater shots are breathless. the mama and baby humpbacks are beautiful and watching the great white shark attack its prey is every bit as chilling as ""jaws"". the most amazing scenery for me was the breathtaking views of the himalayas. i had never seen such detail of the vastness of the range.  don't think most young kids today will be too excited by this one, but it surely is one of the most beautifully photographed documentaries i have ever seen.",1
"i was expecting this to be the same kind of schlock as the previous modesty blaise movie, which is why i left it unwatched for so long, but i was very pleasantly surprised.  far from being a succession of silly gun battles and car/boat chases, it was an almost thoughtful analysis of how a pretty girl gets to become as hard as nails, with nothing being overstated or over-rationalized.  it's likely that the budgetary constraints actually helped with that: less time and effort was spent on finding ever-stupider ways for stunt men to pretend to die, and more was dedicated to making the movie worth watching. hell, the biggest gun battle takes place off screen -- and the scene where it is heard is all the better for that background noise, that adds to the suspense -- who's winning? who's dying?  alexandra staden might not be as drop-dead gorgeous as monica vitti, but few are, and she certainly has every ounce of class and fire that's needed to make the character work -- and the shape of her face, her hair, and her tall, slender body could have been lifted straight from the comic-strip graphics.  nikolaj coaster-waldau was the perfect choice for a blaise bad-guy, in that he made the character interesting and enjoyable to watch -- even likable (and i doubt i'd consider taking on many brutal, psychopathic murderers as drinking buddies). i can't think of a single one of hollywood's ""former waiters"" who could have pulled the role off that well.  fortunately, blaise baddies always die, in the end (no spoilers there!) that's a really good thing, because all the girls who would have spent their time swooning over such a disgustingly handsome and interesting hunk can now pragmatically settle for us ordinary joes.",1
"the problem is the role of the characters in the film. man to man shows a british anthropologist kidnapping two pygmies and taking them to scotland and then realising that they are not animals or subhumans but actually equal to himself. the problem is the role of the pygmies in the film - two people who are kidnapped, treated like animals, and yet given such a shallow, stereotypical role within the film... the kidnapper (british anthropologist) ends up being the hero of the film because he 'manages' to relate to the pygmies... no notion of how the two hostages feel, of their point of view, of their ordeal... i find it is a shallow film, with a one sided fundamentally racist view... it never manages to move away from the 'white mans' view",0

"i bought this video at walmart's $1 bin. i think i over-paid!!! in the 1940s, bela lugosi made a long string of 3rd-rate movies for small studios (in this case, monogram--the ones who made most of the bowry boys films). while the wretchedness of most of these films does not approach the level of awfulness his last films achieved (ed wood ""classics"" such as bride of the monster and plan 9 from outer space), they are nonetheless poor films and should be avoided by all but the most die-hard fans.  i am an old movie junkie, so i gave this a try. besides, a few of these lesser films were actually pretty good--just not this one.  lugosi is, what else, a mad scientist who wants to keep his rather bizarre and violent wife alive through a serum he concocts from young brides. they never really explained why it had to be brides or why it must be women or even what disease his wife had--so you can see that the plot was never really hashed out at all.  anyways, a really annoying female reporter (a lois lane type without jimmy olsen or superman) wants to get to the bottom of all these apparent murders in which the bodies were stolen! so, she follows some clues all the way to the doorstep of lugosi. lugosi's home is complete with his crazed wife, a female assistant and two strange people who are apparently the assistant's sons (an ugly hunchbacked sex fiend and a dwarf). naturally this plucky reporter faints repeatedly throughout the film--apparently narcolepsy and good investigative journalism go hand in hand! eventually, the maniacs all die--mostly due to their own hands and all is well. at the conclusion, the reporter and a doctor she just met decide to marry. and, naturally, the reporter's dumb cameraman faints when this occurs. if you haven't noticed, there's a lot of fainting in this film. or, maybe because it was such a slow and ponderous film they just fell asleep!",0
"as an amateur historian of ww2/nazi germany, i couldn't wait for this to come out on dvd. i missed it when it was first on in 2003. i don't want to repeat what's already been said in the previous 8 pages of comments about the historical inaccuracies. a better job could've been done portraying the ""charming"" hitler. i also had a small problem with some of the casting choices, not so much for their acting, but for their appearances. peter stormare doesn't look much like rohm, why didn't they make babson as hess wear a wig? and my biggest complaint..so much has always been made of hitler's striking blue eyes, why didn't they make carlyle wear blue contacts? on the plus side, i thought the actors who played goring and drexler looked pretty good. again, as long as people watching this understand that this is supposed to be entertainment 1st, history 2nd i don't think a lot of harm will be done.",1

"being the only movie i was able to see at this year's ""nordische filmtage"" at lübeck, this year's festival will be remembered as a all-time low for me.  this movie, which was announced as an erotic thriller, is nothing more than a sick piece of crap! excuse the language, but there aren't any decent words to describe it.  first of all, the actors are not the best. but even better actors would not have rescued the movie. e.g. the plot: after the first 15 minutes it was quite clear that john was sick, the neighbour girls were not real and that he killed his first girlfriend. the so called ""sex-scene"" was nothing else but disgusting (hitting each other until blood flows for me hasn't anything to do with sexuality), but unfortunately that were not the only disgusting images to be shown. everything else was copied by other directors like e.g. lynch, but of course without their geniality.  so, to summarize the whole film and to save other viewers time and money: guy loses girlfriend, girlfriend turns back home, guy kills girlfriend and becomes mad afterwards, guy imagines hot, but crazy neighbour girls, guy has very disgusting sex with one of them (or so he thinks), in the end he realizes, he is crazy and his girlfriend and her new lover lay in his apartment all the time... bad story, bad actors, pictures, that make you want to vomit...  1 out of 10 (1 point for the fact, that you realize how good you can understand norwegian if you learned swedish - at least one benefit of the evening - and you can't choose 0 points here).",0

"ok, i like b movies...i know what b movies are supposed to represent. but this is just awful. i am amazed it got such a decent overall score. the only redeeming qualities of this flick are the (mostly) marginal splatter effects. don't get me wrong, gore abounds in this flick - but few effects really jumped out at me (like the anal ""probe""...that was great!).  i believe this movie was filmed on a camcorder. c'mon - rent a betacam at least, i've seen porn with better production values (and better acting as well).  acting - sucked! but not in the troma or full moon sort of way.  story - contrived! but thats what you get from films like these. very loose!  sets & props - sucked! my 16 year old brother makes more elaborate sets for our house on halloween.  dubbing and dialogue - sucked! horrible voice acting (i shouldn't even call it acting) and every other word is ""s**t"" or ""f**k"".  there are tons of good classic and b rated horror / splatter flicks out there and they are not that hard to track down. do yourself a favor by not wasting time on this crap!",0
"a fantastic arabian adventure. a former king, ahmad, and his best friend, the thief abu (played by sabu of black narcissus) search for ahmad's love interest, who has been stolen by the new king, jaffar (conrad veidt). there's hardly a down moment here. it's always inventing new adventures for the heroes. personally, i found ahmad and his princess a little boring (there's no need to ask why john justin, who plays ahmad, is listed fourth in the credits). conrad veidt, always a fun actor, makes a great villain, and sabu is a lot of fun as the prince of thieves, who at one point finds a genie in a bottle. i also really loved miles malleson as the sultan of basra, the father of the princess. he collects amazing toys from around the world. jaffar bribes him for his daughter's hand with a mechanical flying horse. this probably would count as one of the great children's films of all time, but the special effects are horribly dated nowadays. kids will certainly deride the superimposed images when abu and the genie are on screen together. and the scene with the giant spider looks especially awful. although most of the younger generation probably thinks that king kong looks bad at this point in time, willis o'brien's stop-motion animation is a thousand times better than a puppet on a string that doesn't even look remotely like a spider. 8/10.",1

this movie has beautiful scenery. unfortunately it has no plot. in order to have a plot there must be a conflict. this movie had none. it spent two hours painting a beautiful scene and failed to ever place any activity in it. the picture tries to be artistic but fails to pay attentions to the fundamentals of story telling.  if you love montana scenery and fly fishing you will find some value in this film just don't expect a story. there isn't one.,0
"i thought the movie (especially the plot) needs a lot of work. the elements of the movie remains westernized and untrue to the attempt of trying to produce an eastern feel in the movie. i'll give three out of many of the flaws of the movie:  first, when shen told wendy that he would help her study the history of china, i was really happy that the audience would receive some information about chinese history; but it turns out that the movie did not exactly show wendy actually studying chinese history; yet instead, the movie only shows wendy practicing the method of remembering what she had studied, which frustrated and put me in dismay.  second, which really bothered me, is how the characters kept mentioning about moon cakes -- moon cakes this and moon cakes that and how good it tastes. yet they didn't really mention the real significance of it. the only they they talked about that had any relevance to the moon cake was the autumn festival, which they did not explain or go in depth. they could have mentioned the myth that correlates with the moon cake -- the moon lady. the myth starts of with how there once exists ten suns and each would rotate rising, but one day all ten suns rose up, drying up the land with the rising intense heat; so the divine archer, hou yi, shot nine of the ten suns, leaving only one sun (there are different versions where the hou yi shot the eight out of nine suns). because of his heroic contribution, he was given the pill of immortality so he could live on forever in case the ten suns do rise up again, but his wife, chang-o stole it. after stealing it, she fled to the moon, where she met a hare. she then came upon an idea and told the hare to pound the pill into many piece so she could spread the pill all over earth, giving everyone immortality. (there are a few variations of this story but throughout my childhood, i, most of the time, heard about this version). i thought details such as this would make the plot more culturally chinese oriented.  the last thing i would point out is the last battle scene of the movie. the teachers that were possessed by the monks were fighting the terra-cotta warriors (the life-like statues of the soldiers) went against the idea of how important chinese history is to the chinese. the terra-cotta warrors serves as a connection of china's past and it was very westernized (where evil must be killed in anyway possible) that the monks in the movies were willing to destroy that connection. it would be understandable if wendy, considering she is chinese-american and doesn't have full chinese knowledge, had no problem destroying these priceless artifacts.  the whole movie was westernized because it seemed that all the monks and shen want to do is fight... i mean, it's rated tvpg due to violence, which goes against the confucius thinking of cooperation and harmony. it would seem more accurate that the monks try to avoid violence and try to work things out peacefully before having to resort to violence.  all in all, all of or either of the producer, writer, or director did not do their research thoroughly and did a messy and effortless job instead. i would suggest that they either stop airing this movie or that they re-shoot the movie so it contains more accurate information; however, i would give it credit (2 stars) for removing one stereotype of asians and asian-americans of being smart and quiet.",0
"this is one of the worst movies i've seen in a long time. the story was boring, the dialogue was atrocious and the acting hammy. i'm not sure if this movie was the result of a film school homework project, but it certainly played like one. it is not even particularly successful in its central conceit of trying to appear as a single continuous take. the whooshing horizontal camera pans are a cheap and unoriginal way of hiding cuts.",0

"it's amazing that from a good, though not wonderful, film made back in the early nineties, a whole franchise can grow. 'stargate; sg1' is, without a doubt, a worthy addition to the science fiction genre and has the right to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with 'star trek' as the kings of sci-fi.  following on from the 1994 feature film 'stargate', this series sees stargate command (a military/science organisation) figuring out that the stargate system can be used to travel to various planets across the galaxy and beyond and the military sets up a number of teams to explore. sg1 is one such team, headed by military veteran colonel jack o'neill, and includes archaeologist doctor daniel jackson, military scientist captain samantha carter and alien teal'c, who has betrayed his overlord leaders in the hopes of one day freeing his people. earth quickly makes an enemy of the goa'uld, a parasitic race who use humans as hosts and think themselves equal to gods.  the top-notch cast have much to be congratulated for in bringing this show to life. richard dean anderson is perfect as the cynical and sarcastic o'neill, who can shift from boyish to deadly in the blink of an eye. michael shanks, as daniel, brings heart and an will of steel to the character, who has grown from wide-eyed innocence to darker and more hard-bitten as the show has progressed. amanda tapping, as carter, has perfected the balance between depicting her character's femininity without comprising the fact she is a strong, intelligent military scientist. christopher judge is excellent as the aloof teal'c, who is able to depict the character's emotions with subtlety. and don s davis is perfect as the esteemed general hammond who leads with a good balance of fairness and firmness.  almost all the episodes are are involving and portrayed with intelligence, reflecting on moral dilemmas as well as the friction between military interests and civilian beliefs (often shown through arguments between o'neill and jackson). guest characters are solidly depicted and story arcs are handled in a manner that doesn't bore viewers. sg1 also excels in humour, from o'neill's wisecracks to episodes that are just wacky and odd! sg1 has everything from action to drama to romance to suspense to the heartbreaking scenes of death. it isn't just an excellent sci-fi show but is an excellent show, overall.",1
"'the luzhin defence' is a movie worthy of anyone's time. it is a brooding, intense film, and kept my attention the entire time. john turturro is absolutely stunning in his portrayal of a tender, eccentric chess grandmaster, and emily watson is spell-binding as the gentle but rebellious daughter of a highly respected russian family. the chemistry between watson and turturro on screen is obvious from the moment their characters meet in the story. all in all, this movie is one of the best in-depth looks at the life of a chess grandmaster, and turturro and watson add a whole non-mainstream, non-cliche feel to the film. most people will come out of the theater thinking, and feeling somewhat touched by this brilliant look at the most unlikely of love stories.",1
"the brilliant thing about withnail & i is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery. freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 15/16. i know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it. i grew up in the forest of dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days (had some great mates - hate to think what they're all up to now - probably running the local council). i've watched it a couple of times on dvd and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection (how can i like this film and the dambusters - doesn't seem right somehow) i certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done. i like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity. i have tried to obtain the soundtrack, but it has not been released (shame, as it's a corker). someone told me it was originally a stage play, not quite sure how that worked but i'm sure it was fun. i liked the little shakespearian touches/references that seem to crop up throughout the film (also spotted the dylan thomas ref as well) and like all little gems, there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to easyrider as they start they're next journey. all in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making (love it!)",1

"***spoilers*** ***spoilers*** are all teen slasher flicks suffering from a drought of originality? it awfully seems so. first of all, this is a noble premise that could've been utilized well. a rejected young nerd who grows up, stalks and murders all the girls who tortured the hell out of him when he was in junior high? can't say you had nothing to work with. but this film goes through the same motions as all the other recent slashers. everything from the score to the camera angles allow us to predict exactly when a false alarm is coming and exactly when the killer will strike. we know the pattern by now. these stupid slasher movies push the credibility envelope more and more by the minute. let me ask you something: who, in their right mind, is going to surprise a friend of theirs in a dark, dreary morgue in the middle of the night and just surprise her out of the blue while she's all alone and surrounded by corpses? does that make any damn sense at all?  ""valentine"" is only occasionally innovative. one good shot involves the butchering of denise richards' character. she gets trapped inside a pool and the killer pokes at her with a chainsaw. there's some good songs in the soundtrack, including one cool track by orgy. the music video is contained in the special features section on the dvd.  even the acting is mediocre at best. the actors all sleep through their roles. of course, david boreanaz is often stoic, even in his portrayal as the title character on ""angel."" denise richards is a fine actress, though, and she keeps a stoneface throughout the movie.

"if you can imagine mickey mouse as a new york street pimp, or john wayne as a communist spy, then you might believe pat boone as a juvenile delinquent on his uncle's farm in kentucky and you could conceivably enjoy this movie.  this film is so stupid that it isn't even campy for a mid 1950s sexless love story. and the problem is that hollywood made such a big deal about pat boone's refusal to kiss a woman not his wife on screen before its release that the audience knows he won't kiss shirley jones so you cannot build any anticipation for the ""screen consummation"" of their love. it's sort of like watching a western in which the cowboys don't have guns.  the story is pointless. even the title song is sung with pained enthusiasm.  april love belongs in the worst film bargain bin along with ishtar and plan 9 from outer space.",0
"ok, i know that a lot of people will probably resent this review as watership down is a ""classic"" and a standard part of most people's childhood, but seeing this film for the first time at the tender age of 18, i must admit: i really hated it.  we watched this film because my sister had read the book and really enjoyed it, and many people who whimpered at the very words ""watership down""- their memories of seeing the film as children and having their emotions torn at the seams- recommended it. to be honest, i wish i hadn't bothered. i gave it the benefit of the doubt; generally i don't like to stop watching a film half way through. this was an exception. it was really, really, excruciatingly, sickeningly dull. this film was possibly the slowest thing i've ever watched (imagine a doped-up snail in space), and really didn't ""do it"" for me. the art was alright; the backgrounds were nicely made if not a little bland and twee, yet the rabbits themselves were not very endearing and the animation was quite jumpy and poorly produced.  i'm not going to go into huge details about the storyline; basically it is the tale of a group of rabbits who leave their warren due to the infiltration of humans in the area. generally a moralistic story about the perils of human interactions on the environment, it uses anthropomorphic rabbits to put the message across. for me, i kind of wished that they would get gassed, not because i'm a horrible sadistic person, but because the characters were uninspiring, annoying, dull and generally quite rude (oh i'm so terribly english). i found that i was constantly looking at the clock whilst watching the film, and it took a whole 20 minutes or so before anything actually happened, and even that was a terrible anticlimax.  if i were to praise it in any way, i'd have to admit that the concept of showing children the perils of building on the countryside and hopefully unveiling the arrogance of humans etc etc is quite well-meaning. maybe it is all in general sanctimonious and preachy, but the message it's trying to put forth is good in its nature. the musical score was not bad, too.  so, to conclude, this film is pretty poor. i couldn't watch it the whole way through, or i'd probably be forced to eat my own legs in sheer boredom. granted, it isn't ""torque"" bad, but it still doesn't rate highly in my eyes, so i've given it a 2/10.  hope this helps.",0
"i have given this film an elevated rating of 2 stars as i personally appear in minutes 42 and 43 of the film....the road side bar scene in russia. in this scene the director of the movie offered me the immortal line - ""50 dollars..you drink and talk"", but i felt that my polish counterpart could speak in a more convincing russian accent than i could, so i declined to take this speaking part on. i was slightly starstruck as this was my first film experience....and who knows... these lines could have ended up there with lines such as ""i'll be back"" and ""quite frankly my dear, i don't give a damn"". had i spoken that one line then my name would appear in the credits of rancid aluminium as 'heavy 1' instead of the name of ryszard janikowski.   as time goes on, i am counting myself lucky that my name is in no way connected to this film.  even though i spent a whole day on the set, in south wales hot-spot barry island, no one could tell me what the actual storyline was. the caterers and the wardrobe lady all concurred that it appeared to have a lot of swearing and nudity in it..... things could certainly have been worse if i'd ended up naked in this most dreadful of films....  still.....on the positive side....i got chatting to rhys ifans during one break. i had no idea who he was, as ""notting hill"" was yet to be released, and not an inkling that he might be welsh. made various inappropriate comments about what an awful pit barry island had become since my childhood visits there in the 70s and 80s. it was only when keith allen showed up that i realised i was in a quality production........",0
"i haven't seen all of jess franco's movies, i have seen 5, i think, and there are more than 180 of them. so maybe it's a bit early to say so but ""necronomicon geträumte sünden"" (better known as 'succubus', but that is the cut version) is according to me if not the best, certainly on of franco's best. franco is best known (although 'known' might be slightly exaggerated) for ""vampiros lesbos"", a weird cultish movie that got more acclaim in the mid 90's when people found out jess franco was also an interesting composer. through the soundtrack a happy few discovered the man and found out what was to be expected after seeing the video clip of 'the lion and the cucumber' ('vampyros lesbos ost'): jess franco is an overwhelming director. when the phone rang during 'vampiros', i let it ring. i just wanted to see more of the movie. since that moment franco never could grip me that much. but then i stumbled on this movie. it is even better than ""vampiros lesbos"", i think. franco is looking for what he can do with a story and a camera. we find out he can do a lot. i certainly didn't expect to find ""necronomicon"" that great: its beginning didn't impress me at all. remember, i had seen ""vampiros lesbos"" before (although chronologically that came only three years later) and both movies kinda start the same. but then the story went on, puzzling and gripping, beautiful camera work and the stuff you would like to see godard do if he weren't so occupied with spreading his political messages. later on in the movie i heard a dialogue about which art was or wasn't old-fashioned. the man says that all movies have to be old-fashioned because it takes weeks before the audience sees what got filmed. but the girl replies that ""bunuel, fritz lang and godard yesterday made movies for tomorrow"". janine reynaud is an interesting lead actress and of course howard vernon, a franco regular, is also there. luckily the acting is good (something that can spoil a lot of franco movies for you, but not this one). but certainly watch out for the dummy scene. the erotic tension, the wild directing and the fact that it's a yesterday's movie for tomorrow make it a movie a lot of people should see. the fact that it is a bit more accessible than ""vampiros lesbos"" certainly helps.",1
"i have to say despite it's reviews angels in the outfield was a pretty good movie. i like the fact how it teaches kids to always have faith and never give up because yes miracles can happen. unlike the other baseball movies this one particular movie stood out because of hits amazing special effects and well orchestrated soundtrack which was very interesting. though i liked this movie it did have some flaws such as some irrelevancy (i.e. towards the end when ray mitchell hits a homer he doesn't step on the plate and therefore that wouldn't be a score. but that's just nitpicking.) i have to say i was really impressed with this movie's presence and moral: just have faith, don't give up.",1
"""the gingerbread man is the first thriller i've ever done!""  robert altman   in 1955 charles laughton directed ""the night of the hunter"", a spooky slice of southern gothic in which robert mitchum plays a scary serial killer. one of the film's more famous sequences consists of two kids escaping from mitchum on a rowboat, the kids frantically paddling whilst mitchum wades after them like a monster.   seven years later mitchum played an equally spooky killer in ""cape fear"", another film set in the american south. that film featured a local attorney trying to protect his family and likewise ended with mitchum terrorising folks on a boat. in 1991 martin scorsese, trying to branch out and tackle something more mainstream, remade ""cape fear"", boat scene and all.  now we have robert altman's ""the gingerbread man"", another slice of small town southern gothic. altman says he consulted ""the night of the hunter"" for inspiration and tackled such a mainstream film purely because he wanted to ""spread his wings and try a popcorn picture"", but what he's secretly attempting to do here is deconstruct the canonical films of the southern gothic genre.  so instead of a showdown on small boat, we get a showdown on a giant ship. instead of two kids being kidnapped, we get two kids being safely returned to the police. instead of money being hidden, we have money being readily given via a last will and testament. instead of the righteous attorney of the 1961 film and the deplorable attorney of the 1991 remake, we get a rather three-dimensional lawyer in kenneth branagh. instead of the monster chasing the family we get the hero chasing the bad guys. instead of the monster breaking into the family's house boat, we have the hero hunting the monster on board the monster's ""house ship"". similarly, instead of a murderous serial killer we get an innocent weirdo played by robert duvall. . .etc etc etc.  altman goes on and on, reversing everything just a little slightly, pulling at the edges and doing his own thing. his touch is most apparent during the film's first half-hour, the film existing in an uneasy space between conventional plot-driven movie storytelling and altman's fondness for overlapping dialogue, casual narratives, prowling camera movement and the way that characters aren't so much introduced as they are simply part of what's going on.  still, despite altman's best intentions, the film never rises above mediocrity. altman's too bound to the conventions of the ""thriller format"" to do much damage, his style is too lethargic to generate tension and the film is simply not radical enough to counterpoint other canonical films in the genre. ""gingerbread man"" is thus too mainstream to work as a more pure altman film and too altman to work as a mainstream thriller.  the film's not a complete waste, though. robert downey junior, kenneth branagh and the usually intolerable daryl hannah, all turn in juicy performances. the film also has a nice atmosphere, set against a approaching hurricane, and the final act contains some interesting twists and turns. while it's not the complete disaster that scorsese's ""cape fear"" was, the film still never amounts to anything special.  7/10  in the late 90s altman made 3 successive films set in the american south: ""kansas city"", ""gingerbread man"" and ""cookie's fortune"". unlike ""gingerbread man"", both ""kansas city"" and ""cookie's fortune"" tackle the genre on the broader, more looser canvases that altman was most comfortable with.   ""kansas city"" is the more important of these two films, its hierarchies of class, politics and crime, and its desire to break radically away from typical gangster genre frameworks, would prove influential on all serious 21st century film crime writers (see, for example, ""the wire""). that said, ""cookie's fortune"", while a much slighter tale, is perhaps the better picture.  note: altman claims that this is his first thriller, but he directed ""images"", an art house thriller, in 1972.  worth one viewing.",1

"i actually found this movie 'interesting'; finally one worth my time to watch and rent. it is true... some scenes were over the top on emotionalism, shouting, etc., but what movie doesn't stress its agenda, genre or 'ax to grind'? almost none! what surprised me is that i read a review elsewhere done by a s.fran reviewer on another review site, but found his negative review instead a more accurate description of his ""own"" review of the movie; not of the movie at all. anyone that watches this movie will realize that it is great to recommend to family and friends; no car chases, yea!! being ""in"" an italian family myself, i can fully relate to the environment portrayed on the screen. the movie has its tear jerking parts as well. it is what real life can be in such an environment. nice movie.",1
"""the college girl murders"" is my first acquaintance with the writing work of edgar wallace  and generally my first real acquaintance with ""krimi"" films in general  and i can say that i'm moderately impressed. this stuff is really entertaining, although i never would have expected it to be so  goofy! the film has an exhilarating and nicely convoluted plot, with a healthy dose of humor, flamboyant twists and pretty inventive killings. there's some james bond type of evil mastermind  who always sits in the shadow and in front of a large monitor - recruiting prisoners to kill certain girls at a specific college with a new type of poison. there's also a villainous monk with a whip, dressed like a communist kkk member, getting rid of the leftover characters, like overly curious teachers and such, as well as a kooky police commissioner who persists on solving the case with a psychological approach. seriously, if i had known sooner that these krimi films were so colorful and crazy, i would have purchased a whole collection of them already. the pretzel plot actually raises more questions than it answers in the end, and the overload of comical gimmicks on the account of scotland yard inspector higgins are sometimes a bit much to swallow, but i don't care because it was sublime entertainment. even the funky 60's soundtrack remained stuck in my head for a long time. it's like a variant on the italian giallo, but with slapstick elements.",1

"this is another fantasy favorite from ralph bakshi; after watching it on youtube that is. set in the distant past after the ice age, it is a prehistoric sword-and-sorcery quest between good and evil. nekron, lord of the realm of ice and his mother queen juliana, has set their sights on conquest of the known world. when their glaciers destroy's the village of a man named larn, he (larn) vows to avenge his people and kill the ice lord. meanwhile, the sub-human minions of nekron and juliana capture firekeep's king jarol's sultry daughter princess teegra; but she manages to escape, and eventually meets with larn, who promises to escort her back to firekeep; if the sub-humans don't find them first.  this movie did very little box office (as did most of ralph bakshi's films), but has become a cult classic, partly for the quality of the art, a collaboration between ralph bakshi and the famed fantasy artist frank frazetta. also, i have heard that the screenplay was written by gerry conway and roy thomas, the two men who had done conan comic book stories, and the background painters included james gurney, the illustrator of the dinotopia novels; though admittedly i had never read conan or dinotopia. and also the painter thomas kinkade, noted for his artwork for figurines, music-boxes for the bradford exchange company besides paintings. and like bakshi's films the lord of the rings and american pop, this movie was rotoscoped, but the process works better in this film than in the former.  so overall, i think it's one of the best animated fantasy movies ever made, and an awesome collaboration between two great minds - ralph bakshi and frank frazetta. with plenty of fantasy, sexual innuendo, and thrilling adventure.",1
"the odd couple is the classic film version of neil simon's most famous play about a tv newswriter named felix unger, who is an obsessive neat freak, who moves in with his divorced best friend, oscar madison, a sportswriter and complete slob, after his wife frances throws him out of their apartment. already divorced, oscar takes his best friend in and regrets it from the moment he does it. neil simon's classic comedy first came to broadway with art carney playing felix and walter matthau playing oscar. jack lemmon takes over for carney in the film version with a memorable performance as felix unger. lemmon is not only terribly funny in the role but so vividly real that he brings an element of melancholy to the pitiful figure that is felix unger. matthau, fortunately, was allowed to recreate his role as oscar, a one-of-a-kind gem of comic performance that provides consistent laughs throughout. this teaming of lemmon and matthau turned out to be comic gold that was re-visited in nine other films. with both of these actors no longer with us, the viewing of this classic becomes more touching but no less hilarious. simon's play has been nicely expanded for the screen with a silent prologue chronicling a depressed felix's suicide attempt that is a winner. the supporting cast includes herb edelman, john fiedler, larry haines, and david sheiner as oscar's poker playing buddies and moncia evans and carole shelley as the piedgon sisters, blind dates of oscar and felix. of course, it later became an excellent tv series with tony randall and jack klugman, but there's nothing like the original. a joy from start to finish.",1

"for those of us that lived thru those weeks of filming in town and around the valley - lest we not forget the tedious days of road closures and ""film-making"". as a reminder to those that live here - locales include boulder creek, bonny doon, davenport, big basin. etc. the bank was the bc firehouse; chase scenes included moon drive off hwy 236, empire grade rd, and hwy 1.  production: jeffrey jones was the most approachable, matt broderick was above us all - even back then. as far as the film goes - a joke of a script and even a bigger laugh regarding acting and plot - but who cares at this level. a nice time capsule for those that enjoy our coast and valley scenery.  additional notes; joe's bar (jed's tavern in the film), original name of the film was welcome to buzzsaw - the old erba's parking lot was the town square, the backyard shots were off of grove street in boulder creek; turn off the thinking cap and see a few actors in their early days.",0
"it probably isn't fair that i have got to see the majority of all the interesting reviews on the sopranos and then get to add what people have forgotten, but oh well.......  from a standpoint of acting, how could any actor fail with these characters? each one mesmerizing and intense in their pursuits of life. tony soprano-while a mob ""capo"" and suffering from mental illness, still sees his life in front of him and knows what has to be done to survive. each of his men, you see their lives virtually from the inside like the truest form of voyerism. it definitely brings out a sort ""nosey"" side in each and every viewer, and i include myself in this!  while some above don't care for bracco, i have to say this is the freshest role she has had in years since good fellas. she is the side of tony that makes him listen to reason, that makes him decent, that offers him respite when dealing with his human emotions that he has failed to feel for so long, if ever. she is simply put, his savior. (not speaking in religious tones)  but the knockout performance here is without doubt, edie falco. to see her prison guard role in the other acclaimed hbo series, ""oz"" and then see her as livia is the ultimate compliment for any actor or actress. she has transcended the boundries of a recognizable actress, something only actresses like merle streep can get away with. a sort of chameleon quality to transcend roles. but as i have mentioned before, with a characters a strong as these, how can any actor fail?  livia's strength is in her daily affirmation of faith in herself. she is a survivor, as she hopes her husband and family will be survivors. she is prepared for the worst because she knows the hazards of her husband's business, yet knows the lifestyle she has is more then most women from jersey. she is wise if not wiser and more street savvy then tony himself.  all in all, the biggest crime from the soprano family is that we the viewer have to wait until january 2000 to see the next season. this in my opinion is the worst thing about the hbo series. it was what brought the larry sanders show, sex and the city, dream on, and others back down to earth in popularity and eventually killed them. too much space in between seasons and very sporadic. until then, i will watch the reruns with the hope that this gap in programming is filled.",1
"i wanted to like magnolia. the plot reminded me of grand canyon (which i liked). 4 different lives/stories that come together at the end but magnolia took a wrong turn halfway through the movie and i was lost. i almost turned it off right then and there but i felt i should hang in there until the end, little did i know it would be another torturous 1 1/2 hours. thank god i rented instead of seeing it in the theatre. i almost screamed out in frustration after 2 hours. the biggest kick in the pants was the ending frog scene. my dvd player still hasn't forgiven me and i don't blame it one bit. it was a unique movie, but a bad, boring, and pointless movie.",0

"a truly disturbed, cannibalistic psychopath, john(gary kent, under the pseudonym michael brody) who lives in a cave, stalks campers who make the unfortunate mistake of backpacking in his wilderness. steve(dean russell)and his buddy charlie(john batis)get into a playful argument with their wives, sharon(tomi barrett, the late real-life wife of gary kent))& teddi(ann wilkinson)over surviving in the woods camping by themselves. to prove a point, the gals decide to head for the wilderness out of los angeles for a camping trip disturbing their partners to the point that they soon follow afterward. falling prey to john, teddi is soon killed as sharon runs for her life as the men arrive late to the wilderness due to their truck's overheating. afraid, tired, and paranoid, sharon receives some very unusual assistance..john's ghost children! that's right, john's children remain in the wilderness, ghostly apparitions which spy on those who exist in the woods, taking a special liking to sharon, helping guide her to safety and her friends. meanwhile, steve and charlie soon find shelter from a down pour and the darkness of night in the very cave where john lives. cooking over a burning fire, the meat simmering is actually from charlie's wife, teddi! unknowingly charlie eats from the meat when offered by john who finds the outsiders inside his dwelling place! anyway, soon, worried about their wives, steve and charlie set out to find them as morning breaks. meanwhile, john goes a hunting, with charlie, steve, and sharon in a fight for survival. when steve suffers a compound fracture stumbling between two massive rocks over a flowing river, he will be handicapped only increasing such an already nightmare scenario, with sharon following her ghostly young friends to potential safety..they even, at one point, plead with their father to not kill her. charlie, unfortunately, doesn't have such friends.  director donald jones(..who also wrote it and went broke funding the film)smartly shoots the film in such a breathtaking, gorgeous location in the sequoia national park, in california, where those gargantuan trees tower to great heights, and i basically watch backwoods slashers for this very purpose. for some strange reason, i didn't particularly find jones' direction of the setting very atmospheric..the dread was missing, although there are some rather disturbing attacks by john using his knife(..shot in a clever way, jones' camera suggests more than what is actually on screen, yet, somehow, still achieves that gasp at what john is doing to victims). within such a picturesque landscape, to see innocents preyed upon by a maniac, that kind of increases the terror. city folk attempting to spend a nice few days in a different place, to smell the clean, fresh air, enjoy the sights of a lovely view, only to find themselves stalked by a creepy predator with a very intimidating knife. providing the back-story to why john is the monster he is, jones allows us to witness his memory flashback in discovering his wife's adultery and reacting accordingly(..she is also a ghost in the wilderness looking for her children, wishing to punish them for ""being naughty"")killing both her and the lover in bed(..a refrigerator repairman). the children, sad and depressed committed suicide and now ""haunt"" the wilderness, still interacting with their pa or whoever they so choose. i realize such a novelty as ghost children in a backwoods slasher is unique and appreciated by some, but i found the idea rather hokey and too silly to take serious. they do help our heroine escape a few potentially dangerous situations, but it was awfully hard for me to keep from giggling uncontrollably. the music i found hideously 80's and the performances aren't mind-blowing. i mean i could react to the situation they were in, because it is indeed quite terrifying to find yourselves in an unfamiliar and hostile territory being hunted by someone who knows the area so well. i think the film is similar in many ways to don't go into the woods..alone!, except that the forest has the aforementioned ghost children(..their voices echo when talking to sharon, their father, or each other). gary kent looks like a filthy george lucas, with tattered clothes, and humanity lost. as i mentioned above, the violence isn't as grisly as what is suggested because director jones is able to effectively cut away from a great deal of knife penetration, yet the way he stages the set pieces leave you rather unsettled(..such as teddi's murder, the violence mostly silhouetted on the surface of a nearby huge stone formation, her pleas for john to stop and, once stabbed several times, attempts to crawl away from her predator only to be finished off;a hanging corpse john is skinning). i've seen better and worse of this type of slasher film, it's rather mediocre, at best, with some effectively shot scenery. i don't really think it's particularly memorable, for the exception of the ghost children.",0
"this film moves the cinderella story forward to the early 1950s and makes good, if eccentric, use of the isle of man as a background. the ugly sisters have become wildly glamorous upper-class english girls, and together with kathleen turner as the stepmother they flounce about in various wonderful period costumes. the story is altered a little from the traditional version: early on it is oddly combined with the plot of ""king lear"", and in later stages cinderella is rather more assertive than is usual. it looks splendid and works on the whole pretty well, but does go over the top at times.",1
"this is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of deja vu, don't be surprised. all they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. and it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with. it never works. and like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre.  the plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story. had this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and have been very satisfying and i would have thought it more worthwhile. but here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught. i never like this message resulting from a movie.",0

"deeply humorous yet honest comedy about a bunch of grownups (bill paxton, julie warner, kevin pollak, elizabeth perkins, vincent spano, matt craven, and diane lane) who are invited back to spend a week to tomawka, a camp in (ontario) canada by their former consuelor (alan arkin). writer/director mike binder drew upon his experience at the same camp as the main source of creating a gentle and understanding yarn that makes sense. also, the movie has plenty of funny moments, some of which are completely bizarre like my favorite, the one involves using masking tape. newton thomas sigel (""the usual suspects"", ""three kings"") provides the film with some impressive shots of the canadian wilderness. among the cast, sam raimi, director of ""the evil dead"" films and ""the gift"", appears here as arkin's bumbling right-hand man. one more thing, this film reassured me that a camp doesn't have to be a site of bloody murders.",1
"young and attractive japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again, this time it involves mobile phones. various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed, so essentially if you've seen more than 2 recent japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tied.  the main attraction here is the fact that takashi miike is behind the camera. so far i've been more impressed with his low key works like city of lost souls, however as one missed call plodded along i was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of dead or alive or the overly pseudo-cronenberg style of audition. despite a lot of his films being essentially empty, at least they do have merits such as these, or at least something to keep your attention like tadanobu asano prancing about in shiny suits impersonating johnny depp. there's none of that in one missed call; there's just very little of credit: the acting is bland and average, there is very little (nothing, in all honesty) in the way of scares or suspense, and in places it's just downright boring.  however, there are moments where miike's glacier-like sense of humour seeps through the bland commercialism; most notably with the instance of the tv show intent on filming the demise of one of the cursed subjects, and the tv programmer more concerned about his ratings than the girls' life. but aside from this there is nothing to suggest it is miike behind the camera; most notably his usual visual flair has vanished without a trace (and that includes his famous gore), although it's more likely he just didn't have any enthusiasm for the project, and i can understand why. one missed call isn't offensively bad. it's just frustratingly average.  miike obviously loves directing. with his huge yearly output it's obvious he isn't going to be 100% concerned about all his projects. but even with this in mind, one missed call felt like he was just paying the bills.",0

"bill (buddy rogers) is sent to new york by his uncle (richard tucker) to experience life before he inherits $25million. his uncle has paid 3 women jacqui (kathryn crawford), maxine (josephine dunn) and pauline (carole lombard) to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of gold-diggers. one such lady cleo (geneva mitchell) turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women. we follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that bill is in new york, while bill meets with cleo and another woman. at the end, love is in the air for bill and one other .............  the picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film. the story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and kathryn crawford has a terrible voice. rogers isn't that good either. he's pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone. there is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver (roscoe karns) and the film is just dull.",0
"the plot sounded like it had promise. to be honest i did not watch the entire movie. after about an hour into the movie i had to make a decision. is this movie worth watching until it conclusion? the answer was clearly no! it was not the fact that the human body could not receive a transplant from a different species without rejecting it. nor the premise that he was being chased by secret government authorities for an human / wolf transplant. it was because the movie was badly written, acting lacked emotion and i did not understand the several dream sequences with the wolves and buffaloes. when he was running to the zoo with a dog pack and leaving them at the front of the zoo gate the saying ""if you can't run with the big dogs don't leave the porch"" kept running through my bored mind. save yourself the time and skip this movie. i can guarantee if you do dare to watch it you will sit there slack jawed as i did wondering why anyone waste money, time, energy and effort to make this insulting outrage to american cinema.",0
"jill dunne (played by mitzi kapture), is an attractive, nice woman, over-whelmed by a smart-mouthed teenage daughter, liv (martha macisaac) and a petty, two-timing husband, sean (rick roberts), both of which were tediously self-centered, and obnoxious.  this was advertised as a troubled family stalked by a crazed killer during a relentless storm.  the storm doesn't even happen until about the last 5 minutes of the film, and then it isn't anything to send anybody running to the storm cellar.  the stalking, likewise doesn't get intense until almost the end of the film.  most of the film we spend listening to jill and her insufferable daughter, liv, argue until i just wanted to back slap the daughter into next week.  jill's problem with liv is that she has taken up with zack, a boy of questionable character, and they are constantly making out--in fact jill comes home to find the two of them on liv's bed.  the rest of the time we spend listening to jill's husband sean either whine at jill or criticize her.  sean was not at all appealing--since his face is so covered in freckles you could play connect the dots.  the story begins with jill being notified of an out-standing bill on their credit card for a hotel she has never been to, and that she thought sean had never been to either.  jill goes to the hotel where she meets the owner & manager, richard grant (nick mancuso), a very nice, older, divorced man, who is sympathetic to her. in fact, when he spots her husband there again, he phones jill and tips her off.  jill returns to the hotel, sees sean with another woman. she is upset, leaves without sean seeing her, and does absolutely nothing. in fact, she doesn't even say anything to sean when he arrives home. this made no sense to me.  jill has given richard her business card, and so he calls her and she is apparently in real estate. she shows him a condo. afterwards they have a drink, and things get cozy between them.  richard and jill are getting it on, hot and heavy. in fact, he seems a bit more aggressive than necessary, when jill suddenly decides to cut out.  jill and sean have a confrontation about his cheating. sean whines about how jill has been letting him down since her father died. apparently his lack of any morals is all her fault. eventually jill confesses her own lack of morals and near adultery to sean--and of course that's all her fault too, as far as sean is concerned.  the little family decides to go on a camping trip--which means more whining and grousing among them, especially from the spoiled daughter.  i was so rooting for the stalker to get everybody, but jill.  3 stars",0

"i think a lot of people just wrote this off as another one of tom cruise's weird movies (magnolia, eyes wide shut) but vanilla sky is definitely its own movie. many people said it was weird; it wasn't. it was different and confusing but not weird. weird is stanley kubrick or pauly shore. different is the truman show. confusing is the matrix or the game. and unlike kubrick, this movie has a conclusion. everything makes sense -- maybe not immediately, maybe not even today, but it will make sense. vanilla sky is confusing because david aames (tom cruise) is confused. that's the point. that's where the so-called ""weirdness"" that turned critics away came in. if they had bothered to ""open [their] eyes"" as the original 1997 spanish movie, they would have seen that. and if that's not enough reason to see it, go see it for the music. cameron crowe offers a wonderful soundtrack; he uses it to set the ""feel"" -- that notorious element that many movies lack. with songs like the beach boys' ""good vibrations"" playing at the dramatic and emotional climax of the movie, he creates an offbeat, yet astoundingly ""right"" feel. a wonderful film, in its script, music, acting, and images, vanilla sky is sadly, a superficial bandwagon movie that critics chide in order to appear intelligent. excellent: a+",1
"i liked top gun. it held my interest. predictable plot, decent character development and story line. it is pretty similar to high noon in that the town people appear weak and scared to stand up to a villain. this movie has some quality actors who really did not get a chance to share all of their talents. also some of the actors did not receive credit for their roles. denver pyle was a good looking man in his younger days. john dehner, rod taylor are outstanding in their roles. sterling hayden did the best that he could with poor material. it is hard to imagine him as a gunslinger. laura, played by karen booth, was a nauseating character. she seemed flattered that two men may have been fighting over her. ugh. finally, how can people travel without luggage? especially women.",1
"the most satisfying element about ""dan in real life"" is that the relationship between dan (steve carell) and marie (juliette binoche) makes sense and is beautifully realistic. the casting of oscar-winner juliette binoche as dan's love interest was a superb decision; she is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank goodness, appropriately aged for the part! had this movie been made with jessica alba or scarlett johansson, it would have been a disaster.  another wonderful aspect about ""dan in real life"" is that it is a perfect film for adults who are interested in a mature comedy that leaves out the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: dumb chicks, chauvinistic guys, and sleazy jokes. ""dan in real life"" is witty and has fun, intelligent laughs throughout. whereas other comedies incorporate or are almost entirely based on jokes that shock the audience into laughing, the jokes from ""dan in real life"" are more natural and clever, and involve some thinking on the part of the audience.  my only problem with ""dan in real life"" is that the rebellious, middle daughter is played too outrageously by actress brittany robertson. it's difficult to say if this was a personal choice on her part or a choice by the director. either way, her character is unrealistic and annoying. but, this is only a minor flaw in the film, and does not take away from the story as a whole.  all in all, ""dan in real life"" is a great film, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of offensive and dumbed-down comedies. the quality of the writing, directing, acting, and (especially) cinematography is excellent. it is simply a beautiful, light-hearted comedy.",1
"this night listener is better than people are generally saying. it has weaknesses, and it seems to be having a genre identity crisis, no doubt, but i think its creepy atmosphere and intriguing performances make up for this. the whole thing feels like one of those fireside ""this happened to a friend of a friend of mine"" ghost stories. one big complaint about the movie is the pacing: but the slow and sometimes awkward pacing is deliberate. everything that unfolds in this movie is kept well within the realm of possibility, and real life just sort of plods alongno? so there are no flashy endings or earth-shattering revelations, no ""showdown"" scenes. thank heaven. you have to get into the zone when watching this movie, forget your reservations and your expectations of what makes a (conventionally)good movie. williams isn't terrific, but he easily meets the needs of the story, plus his character is supposed to be somewhat generic (""no one"") as he is the everyman, the avatar by which we ourselves enter the story. toni collette's performance should be nominated for an oscar (even if she maybe shouldn't win it). give it a shot. for quality and content alone, the night listener is surely in the top twenty percent of movies coming out these days.",1

"i had the privilege of watching scarface on the big screen with its beautifully restored 35mm print in honor of the 20th anniversary of the films release. it was great to see this on the big screen as so much of it is lost on television sets and the overall largesse of this project cannot be emphasized enough.   scarface is the remake of a classic rags to riches to the depths of hell story featuring al pacino as cuban drug lord tony montana. in this version, tony comes to america during the cuban boat people immigration wave in the late 1970s, early 1980s. tony and his cohorts quickly get green cards by offing a political figure in tent city and after a brief stay at a cuban restaurant; tony is launched on his horrific path to towards total destruction.   many of the characters in this movie a played in such skilled manner that is so enjoyable to watch i have forgot little of this film over the last twenty years. robert loggia as tony's patron, frank lopez is wonderful. his character is flawed by being too trusting, and as tony quickly figures out, soft. lopez's right hand, omar suarez is portrayed by one of our greatest actors, f. murray abraham (amadeus.) suarez is the ultimate toady and will do anything for frank; it is like he does not have a mind of his own. tony quickly sees this and he constantly battles with suarez, but really only sees him as a minor problem to get through on his way to the top. the character that always comes back to me as being played so perfectly is mel bernstein, the audaciously corrupt miami narcotics detective played by harris yulin (training day.) mel, without guilt extorts great sums of money form all sides of the drug industry. he plays tony off of frank until it catches up with him in a scene that marks the exit from the film of both frank and mel. it is priceless to hear frank asking for mel to intercede, as tony is about to kill him only to hear mel reply, `it's your tree frank, you're sitting in it.' this is from the man who frank had been paying for protection!  tony's rise is meteoric and is only matched in speed and intensity by his quick crash and burn. after offing frank and taking his wife and business tony's greed takes over and he never can seem to get enough. as tony plunges deeper into the world of drugs, greed and the inability to trust he eventually kills his best friend and his sister who had fallen in love and married. this all sets up the ending in which tony's compound is stormed by an army from his supplier who feels betrayed because tony would not go through with a political assassination that was ordered. this all stems form a compassionate moment when tony refused to be an accomplice in a murder that would have involved the victim's wife and children.  all in all this is a great depiction of 1980s excess and cocaine culture. depalma does a nice job of holding it all together in one of the fastest moving three hour movies around. the violence is extremely graphic and contains a few scenes that will be forever etched on any viewers mind, particularly the gruesome chainsaw seen, the two point blank shots to the head and the entire bloody melee that ends the movie. this is a highly recommended stylistically done film that is not for the squeamish, or for those who need upbeat endings and potential sequels; depalma let it all fly right here.",1
"vampires, sexy guys, guns and some blood. who could ask for more? moon child delivers it all in one nicely packaged flick! gackt is the innocent sho - who befriends a vampire kei (hyde), their relationship grows with time but as sho ages, kei's immortality breaks his heart. it doesn't help that they both fall in love with the same woman. the special effects are pretty good considering the small budget. it's a touching story ripe with human emotions. you will laugh, cry, laugh, then cry some more. even if you are not a fan of their music, see this film. it works great as a stand alone vampire movie.  9 out of 10",1
"hey everyone...  there really isn't much to say for this movie at all. the basic plot is that a guy (brandon) takes a few friends on a trip to his cabin in the woods for a weekend holiday away from work. after picking up a girl on the way there, things start going badly wrong for all of them.  the storyline alone (written by the actor playing brandon, i believe, although i could be wrong here) is unlikely and unconvincing, and is acted out accordingly. the ""clown killer"" himself is a rather a sad excuse for a psychotic killer. far from being a dark, mysterious but most of all, intelligent predator, we are instead offered a rather clumsy, nursery rhyme-singing buffoon who appears to be going through a minor mid life crisis. the only thing that warranted the writing of this comment were the sex scenes and whatever gore there was in the film (the quality of the film led me to derive some enjoyment out of such things).  in short, this film falls below every possible set standard. admittedly, i was sharing a few beers with a close friend as i watched this, so we managed to scrape together some relative entertainment value out of this film and it is therefore only fair to mention that s.i.c.k did fall just shy of a two rating. however, in reality, (and with the benefit of hindsight) the one star rating is a more than legitimate score for this film.  1 star out of ten.",0

"...but a lousy film. as maltin says this was christopher lee's attempt to make a serious horror film. well, it is serious...too serious! the plot is silly and slow (something about old people inhabiting the bodies of young children to achieve immortality)...the film is all talk talk talk talk talk talk talk about the same things over and over again. i actually dozed off a few times! the film is sooooo dull! the cast sleepwalks through this with the sole exceptions of peter cushing and lee...but this was probably a labor of love for both (they often complained about horror movies being too violent...well, this has no violence!). avoid at all costs...unless you have insomnia...this will put you to sleep!",0
"a perfect little atrocity...i doubt if a single shot lasted for more then the reglamentary-mtv 4.4 seconds. woeful casting, worse even than in kusminsky's version (a reminder: he managed to miscast juliet binoche and ralph feinnnes). but, hey-the rich got what they deserved. dark and brooding heathcliff reduced to the state of a golden-locked angel, frail and angellic catherine presented as a chubby, melon-breasted heffer, meek and weak linton is a peeping tom, and innocent isabel becomes sara michelle-gellar's character from cruel intentions. 15-year old eddie bauer and abercrombie and fitch donners-take notice. this thing was made for you. it is an hour-and-a-half long music video where everything is given to you; you are saved from the uncomfortable necessity of not even trying to understand the complexity of the characters, but even from initial shock at their actions. the actors tried, but, as i stated before, they were miscasted. decent photography, but editing is on the level of tv production class in high school. i implore you all: read the book, or the cliffnotes even; watch the previous versions of it, even kusminsky's; but stay away from the numerous future reruns, during which you will not receive the benefit of the commercial-free premiere.",0

"just about everything in this movie is wrong, wrong, wrong. take mike myers, for example. he's reached the point where you realize that his shtick hasn't changed since his snl days, over ten years ago. he's doing the same cutesy stream-of-consciousness jokes and the same voices. his cat is painfully unfunny. he tries way to hard. he's some weird type a comedian, not the cool cat he's supposed to be. the rest of the movie is just as bad. the sets are unbelievably ugly --- and clearly a waste of millions of dollars. (cardboard cut-outs for the background buildings would have made more sense than constructing an entire neighborhood and main street.) alec balwin tries to do a funny great santini impression, but he ends up looking and sounding incoherent. there's even an innapropriate cheesecake moment with faux celebrity paris hilton --- that sticks in the mind simply because this is supposed to be a dr. seuss story. avoid this movie at all costs, folks. it's not even an interesting train wreck.

"the long list of ""big"" names in this flick (including the ubiquitous john mills) didn't bowl me over to the extent that i couldn't judge the film on its actual merits. it is full of stereotypes, caricatures, and standard, set scenes, from the humble air-ace hero to the loud-mouthed yank flyer. the music track was such that at one point, about an hour before the end, i thought the film was over: loud, rising crescendo, grand flourish and finish then silence, but then the movie continued! i found no real storyline, haphazard writing, but smartly-pressed uniforms and the pretty jean simmons (pre-nose job) with a rousing little ditty. i cannot say that this picture has any of the ingredients which make a film great. i found it maudlin, mawkish and minor.",0
"this is a typical steele novel production in that two people who have undergone some sort of tragedy manage to get together despite the odds. i wouldn't call this a spoiler because anyone who has read a steele novel knows how they all end. if you don't want to know much about the plot, don't keep reading.  gilbert's character, ophelia, is a woman of french decent who has lost her husband and son in an accident. gilbert needs to stop doing films where she is required to have an accent because she, otherwise a good actress, cannot realistically pull off any kind of accent. brad johnson, also an excellent actor, is matt, who is recovering from a rather nasty divorce. he is gentle, convincing and compelling in this role.  the two meet on the beach through her daughter, pip, and initially, ophelia accuses matt of being a child molester just because he talked art with the kid. all of them become friends after this episode and then the couple falls in love.  the chemistry between the two leads is not great, even though the talent of these two people is not, in my opinion, a question. they did the best they could with a predictable plot and a script that borders on stereotypical. two people meet, tragedy, bigger tragedy, a secret is revealed, another tragedy, and then they get together. i wish there was more to it than that, but there it is in a nutshell.  i wanted mindless entertainment, and i got it with this. in regard to the genre of romantic films, this one fails to be memorable. ""a secret affair"" with janine turner is far superior (not a steele book), as are some of steele's earlier books turned into film.",0
"mahatma has been depicted as a man who neglected his own son in this movie. don't get me wrong i am not condemning the movie; it is such a wonderful movie and walked out of the cinema with a lump in my throat. we need to understand mahatma's spiritual standing, he is a true spiritual leader. only a fully enlightened man could possibly detach himself from his loved ones. a man with such caliber leads his family and followers by example. according to the movie, he spoke to his son and try to make him understand where he is coming from, but poor harilall with so little intellect could not understand his father. when things went wrong with harilall, mahatma could remain calm and accepted that his son is a big tragedy.   had it been any other parents, they would have compromised their values to assist the son to get on his feet. mahatma didn't do that, he is true leader who leads by example.",1

"this movie probably had some potential for something; my bewilderment is how these utterly prosaic unfunny themes keep making it to theaters, it's as if ideas are being recycled just because generations are. truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. this was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially molly's, totally unconvincing). what was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, i was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. the so-called ""hard 10"" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); i honestly found her friend patty (referred to as the hamburglar) to be much better looking than her. but then again, gentlemen prefer brunettes ;) well, anyway, the whole premise is that society is superficial and if love is true it transcends all social facades; the way they showed this, with a dude shaving another's scrotum and the million-times-mutilated-and-beaten-to-death-horse premature ejaculation routine (with obvious allusions to american pie and happiness - the latter in the disgusting scene denouement involving the family dog). i feel as if the movie was like adjoining ridiculous jokes into an unformed wretched ball of raw sewage. goes to show marketing can push anything out there, shine whatever fetid mass and call it gold, people will come (worked for me). done with tirade.",0
"considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's, personal best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between hemingway (chris cahill) and donnelly (tory skinner) as a more than experimental phase of cahill's life.  it seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. this random scene had very little relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. i suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 oregon track and field competition).  this review may seem harsh, but it is the truth. the exploitation of young muriel hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that i would have given to this film.  pepper thompson",0
"when you pick a movie i hope one factor you will consider, are the actors in the movie using their fame to influence the moral fabric of our society in a positive or negative way? this is not a political statement this is a moral issue that effects are society. when a comedian/actor makes curl sexual and racist remarks about a teenager and her father we should ask ourselves (do i want to support that behavior)? in this case mr. foxx behavior tears at the social fabric that teaches our youth right from wrong, good behavior from bad that loving-kindness is better than hatefulness. mr. foxx should remember he is only entertainment and there is a lot of that out there for us to choose from. saying sorry does not get him off the hook. it will not undue the hurt or remove the bad behavior he spreads to our youth. one way to stop this behavior is to stop being a fan of it. no longer see anything they are part of. we cannot change them but we can stop the fame we give them.",0
"what i loved about the on-screen adaptation of the stone angel is that it stayed so true to the novel! great film! as an avid reader, i find the worst thing about film adaptations is that the book somehow gets lost in translation. you can tell the stone angel team was careful not to let this happen with this film.  ellen burstyn was an excellent casting choice for the role of hagar and she is definitely a movie superstar. however, i think the canadian actress (christine horne) chosen to play hagar in her younger years also did an incredible job that warrants great praise. i haven't seen any of horne's previous work but i will definitely seek it out after seeing her stone angel performance.  i heard the canadian theatrical release of the stone angel is going to happen in spring or summer 2008. i can't wait to see it on the big screen again!",1

"first this movie was not that bad.it was entertaining...at least to me for probably all the wrong reasons. i have never seen the original so can't compare the two.  this movie reminded me of that weird christopher reeve movie village of the damned. the two movies have different plots, but that creepy disgusted feeling and unwanted comedy exist in both.  the wicker man is suppose to be a mystery/thriller/men please don't anger the women movie. i don't know the whole pagan thing and sacrifice was a little off.  nicholas cage, his glorious bad self goes to a secluded island called summerisle when he receives a letter in calligraphy from his long lost fiancée who claims her daughter has been taken and hidden by fellow islanders.   cage is a police officer and being the weary policeman he is he goes to the semi uncharted island leaving no word of his whereabouts to anyone who is located in the real world. stupid.  things get weirder when the large amish-esquire women who populate the island snarl at him and lie about the whereabouts of the missing girl. his fiancée is no help who seems to be elusive and weary the whole time. cage stays on the island when he learns that the missing girl is his daughter and he is the lucky man tricked to come to this island as a sacrificial victim during the islands sick harvest festival.  in this movie males do not fare so well. a sick twisted display of feminism?   i found the movie laughable at times particularly when cage punches some women and runs around in a bear suit. i think there were too many potholes in this movie. i find the whole concept of angry women secluding themselves on an island without any care for males quite entertaining, but the way it was portrayed in this movie was just weird. while most women have had some jerk hurt and anger them this is clearly a form of sexism. i would have turned the movie off in disgust if the roles were reversed. this movie is something to watch maybe just once or twice. it is not a thriller it should be categorized as just strange.",0
"etienne girardot is just a character actor--the sort of person people almost never would know by name. however, he once again plays the coroner--one of the only actors in the philo vance films that played his role more than once. i've already seen him two other times and loved him every time because he was so funny and a breath of fresh air. this film also is great to watch because in addition to girardot, there are many other wonderful character actors along for the ride--including grant mitchell, gene lockhart, henry walthal, kent smith, h.b. warner and nat pendleton. this is quite an impressive cast, and they sure made the job easier for leading man and woman edmund lowe and virginia bruce.  these great character actors are one of the big reasons i love these old b-movies. while the mystery itself is rarely that terrific, because of the breezy writing and acting, the films really satisfy. as for this film, vance is played wonderfully by lowe but, like i said, the mystery itself is only an after-thought--with a silly plot involving hypnosis and suicides. unfortunately, you cannot hypnotize anyone to do anything of the sort--i have training in clinical hypnosis and if i could do anything like the evil guy could do in the film, i would have done it! used car salesmen and a few of my old bosses would have been obvious targets!!   overall, while not the best philo vance film, it was very good and it's a darn shame lowe only played this role once. in fact, aside from william powell (who played vance five times), the series was hindered by a long, long succession of actors such as basil rathbone, wilfred hyde-white and warren william (and many others) playing vance. this is a similar problem that also plagued the bulldog drummond series--just too many different actors playing the leading man.  well worth seeing and exciting--though also quite impossible.",1

"an american in paris is a wonderful musical about an american painter living in paris for inspiration. he meets a rich woman who admires his paintings on the street and she believes she can get his work to be even more popular to the public, e.g. in a museum. golden globe nominated gene kelly as the artist jerry mulligan is just perfect at both singing and especially dancing. he also meets the main girl lise bouvier (leslie caron) who is engaged to his best friend. he can't help his feelings for this girl, even after he finds out who she is engaged to. filled with nice romance and wonderful song and dance, this is a very good musical film. it may drag slightly with his dancing dream sequence, i.e. the american in paris ballet, but there is a good happy ending. it won the oscars for best art direction-set decoration, best cinematography, best costume design, best music, scoring of a musical picture, best writing, story and screenplay and best picture, and it was nominated for best director for vincente minnelli and best film editing, it was nominated the bafta for best film from any source, and it won the golden globe for best motion picture - musical/comedy, and it was nominated for best director for vincente millenni (liza's father). gene kelly was number 66 on the 100 movie stars, and he was number 15 on 100 years, 100 stars - men, ""i got rhythm"" was number 32 on 100 years, 100 songs, the film was number 9 on 100 years of musicals, it was number 39 on 100 years, 100 passions, it was number 68 on 100 years, 100 movies, and it was number 58 on the 100 greatest musicals. very good!",1

"an accurate review of nuremburg must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie ""valkyrie"" (tom cruise). ""valkyrie"" (2008) at long last tells the world there was a german resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats, military generals, soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the nazi political regime, install a new chancellor, obtain peace and close the concentration camps. however, these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the french resistance just next door. history writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the german people completely supported the nazis and consequently deserved the 24 hour bombing genocide and ""unconditional surrender"" that was imposed on the germans.   the german enigma codes were broken by english scientists in 1943 so much of what the germans were doing was known. during 1943 the germans developed new jet fighters and jet bombers by companies including arado, heinkel and messerschmitt. however, even if the nazis were eliminated and the german resistance succeeded the allies wouldn't allow any democracy in the world to have jet fighters, jet bombers, high speed submarines, ballistic missiles and radio guided missiles without the usa having them first! this is where the institutionalised agenda is relevant. consequently, the german resistance got no help at all from the allies although they always had crucial intelligence to eliminate adolf hitler. the 20 july 1944 coup is proof there were significant efforts by the germans to obtain peace. instead, the germans got ultimatums of ""unconditional surrender"" and 24 hour saturation bombing in an agenda to avoid peace. the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans and contain complete ownership through an ""unconditional surrender."" it was a premeditated allied agenda to allow the war to perpetuate and keep the nazis in power to justify the 24 hour bombing but it took one year after d-day before allied armies advanced into germany to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists at the barrel of a gun. however, tens of millions of people had died since the allies abandoned the german resistance for their own greed.   the allies imposed ""unconditional surrender"" on the germans as a pretext to complete ownership and control of german property and government and it was done without using the german resistance to over throw the nazis. the allies wanted to steal the world's greatest technology and scientists from the germans to achieve world technological supremacy. consequently, everything else took second place to the evil allied agenda which killed millions of german people in the 24 hour bombing; the concentration camps stayed open; the war was prolonged and led to the ""cold war"" with weapons based on german industrial achievements, technology, and scientists taken from the germans in world war two.  the 1946 nuremburg war crimes trials were a public relations deception and mass murder perpetrated by the allies as retrospective justice to the nazis. it was a smoke screen to hide the evil and greedy allied agenda for world technological supremacy rather than help the german resistance overthrow the nazi political regime.  tens of millions of people died because the allies abandoned the german resistance to an agenda but they inflicted retribution against the german chiefs of staff anyway whom paid with their lives at nuremburg war crimes or not although the allies had perpetrated genocide to achieve world technological supremacy.",0
"someone(or, something thing..)is leaving puncture marks on the jugular and draining victims of their blood till dead. police detective karl brettschneider(melvyn douglas, before slipping out of the b-movie horror genre for greater heights)is stumped at who..or what..is behind these notorious crimes. the village is overcome by hysteria and karl depends on his trusted medical genius, dr. otto von niemann(lionel atwill, in yet another effective mad scientist role)to provide some feedback as to what might be causing the deaths of innocents. he also fears for the safety of his beloved ruth(the lovely fay wray who stars for the third time with atwill after ""doctor x"" & ""the mystery of the wax museum"")who is niemann's assistant.  dwight frye steals the film as a rather loony village idiot who collects bats and carries a demented demeanor wherever he goes..it's easy to see why he becomes a suspect as local paranoia is at a fever pitch. maude eburne provides the film's humor as a very naive(..and easily influenced)patient of von niemann's who believes she has ailments she reads about in books near the laboratory where he works. she's impressionable and often von niemann just humors her and constant fictional illnesses she feels plagued with. lionel belmore returns as yet another frightened, superstitious bürgermeister.  creaky, static, but rather entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast. the film is obviously as low-budget as they come, but this doesn't hurt the film too much since it's put together rather well by director frank r strayer and his crew. i'm certain the film's print has seen better days, though. this is the kind of b-horror item you'd find packaged in with 50 other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers. the film's villain..and his motives for feeding a synthetically made biological creature..certainly provides a different take on the frankenstein formula. many might be disappointed with the end results as the film strays away from being an actual supernatural tale about a real vampire killer causing the murders.",1
"was it foreshadowing when tori complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot, and then her new boyfriend (the murderer) turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence? i think so. scenes to make you squeal with delight: montages galore, a strip-tease in a kimono (what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on, instead of take them off?), and a climactic battle on skis! definitely tune in for the beginning and end, but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening. is it better than co-ed call girl? nah. does tori ever make it to paradise, or out of the snow, even? nope.",0
"i found this movie to be very funny, i loved how it made of the politics of modern day sports. this movie is not as funny as south park but it is pretty funny. and since i am a sports fan i loved how they made fun some of the more ridiculous things in sports. this movie is great for non sports lovers too, probably better for them actually since they have to go through life wondering why people follow sports so closing when there are so many insane rules and intricacies to sports and the fact that it means absolutely nothing. i also found the actual game they came up with to be interesting, it is sort of like horse with bases and psyche outs (for the person shooting). overall i highly recommend you see this movie, and believe that you will end up loving this movie. however if this style of comedy is not your favorite you probably won't like it. (but that is with any comedy movie)",1
"pop quiz: you're a part of the modern armed forces in peacetime on routine manoeuvres and you find yourself thrown back in time with a chance to change history. what do you do? well, if you're a hollywood studio, you change the japanese g.i.s in g.i. samurai (aka timeslip) to the crew of an american aircraft carrier, have them debate stopping the attack on pearl harbour for 90 minutes and then go home and hope that no-one reminds you that japan did it first and with more balls in 1979 with this sonny chiba movie. but unlike its hollywood counterpart the final countdown, this sees its premise through: thrown back 400 years into the japanese feudal wars, its peacetime soldiers decide that their best hope of getting back lies in provoking history by trying to change it by joining with a warlord to conquer the country  cue lots of tank and helicopter vs. samurai action, including a very impressive unrelenting 25 minute battle sequence featuring a cast of thousands inflicting serious damage on each other. and yes, there are decapitations.  of course, things don't go as planned, and even superior firepower doesn't stand up as well as hoped to thousands of soldiers. even before that, the soldiers are falling out with each other into those who want to go home, those who want to go to war and those who want to rape and pillage for the hell of it. impressively directed and surprisingly well thought through, the soft rock and country and western songs are sometimes a distraction, especially when they feature english lyrics sung by japanese singers who audibly can't pronounce the words let alone speak the language, but it's a forgivable flaw in a surprisingly good sci-fi actioner.  optimum's uk dvd is a good transfer of the uncut 138-minute version.",1
"live feed is set in some unnamed chinese/japanese asian district somewhere as five american friends, sarah (ashley schappert), emily (taayla markell), linda (caroline chojnacki), mike (lee tichon) & darren (rob scattergood) are enjoying a night on the town & taking in the sights. after a scuffle in a bar with a japanese triad boss (stephen chang) they decide to check out a porno theatre, as you would. inside they are separated & quickly find out that the place belongs to the triad boss who uses it to torture & kill people for reasons which aren't made clear. can local boy miles (kevan ohtsji) save them?  this canadian production was co-written, produced & directed by ryan nicholson who also gets a prosthetic effects designer credit as well, one has to say that live feed is another pretty poor low budget shot on a camcorder type horror film that seems to exist only to cash in on the notoriety & success of hostel (2005) & the mini craze for 'torture porn' as it's become known. according the imdb's 'trivia' section for live feed writer & director nicholson wrote it after hearing about certain activities taking place in live sex theatres, for my money i reckon he wrote it after watching hostel! the script is pretty poor, there is no basic reason given as to why this porno theatre has a big fat ugly freak dressed in bondage gear lurking around torturing & killing people, none. was it for the triads? was it for his pleasure? was it to make snuff films to sell? some sort of explanation would have been nice. also why did he turn on the triad boss at the end? if your looking for a film with a coherent story then forget about live feed. it seemed to me to be some sort of uneasy misjudged mix of sex, s&m, horror, torture, gore & action films which doesn't come off. i mean just setting a horror film in a porn theatre isn't automatically going to make your film any good, there still needs to be a decent script & story, right? the character's were fairly poor clichés & some of their actions & motivations were more than a little bit questionable. it moves along at a reasonable pace, it's fairly sleazy mixing gore, sex & nudity but it does look cheap which lessens the effect.  director nicholson doesn't do anything special here, the editing is choppy & annoying, he seems to think lighting almost every scene with neon lights is a good idea & the film has a cheap look about it. available in both 'r' & 'unrated' versions i saw the shorter cut 'r' version which really isn't that gory but i am prepared to give the benefit of the doubt to the 'unrated' version & say that it might be much, much gorier but i can't say for sure. there's a fair amount of nudity too if that's your thing. i wouldn't say there's much of an atmosphere or many scares here because there isn't & aren't respectively although it does have a sleazy tone in general which is something it has going for it i suppose.  technically live feed isn't terribly impressive, the blood looks a little too watery for my liking & entire scenes bathed in annoying neon lights sometimes makes it hard to tell whats happening, it to often looks like it was shot on a hand-held camcorder & the choppy editing at least on the 'r' rated version is at times an annoying mess. shot on location in an actual porn theatre somewhere in vancouver in canada. the acting is poor, sometimes i couldn't tell if the actresses in this were supposed to be crying or laughing...  live feed is not a film i would recommend anyone to rush out & buy or rent, i didn't think much of it with it's very weak predictable storyline lacking exposition & which goes nowhere, poor acting & less than impressive gore (at least in the 'r' rated cut anyway). watch either hostel films again or instead as they are superior.",0
"i like it because of my recent personal experience. especially the ideas that everyone is free and that everything is finite. the characters in the firm did not really enjoy their ""real"" lives, but they did enjoy themselves, i.e. what they were. the movie did a good job making this simple day a good memory. a good memory includes not only romantic feelings about a beautiful stranger and a beautiful european city, but definitely about the deeper discussion about their values of life. many movies are like this in terms of discussion of the definitions of life or love or relationships or current problems in life or some sort of those. before sunrise dealt with it in a nice way, which makes the viewer pause and think and adjust her breath and go on watching the film. before sunrise did not try to instill a specific thought into your head. it just encouraged you to think about some issues in daily life and gave you some alternative possibilities. this made the conversations between the characters interesting, not just typical whining complaints or flowing dumb ideas. you would be still thinking about those issues for yourself and curious about the next line of the story. the end was not quite important after all. you could got something out of it and feel something good or positive about yourself after the movie. movies are supposed to be enjoyable. this is an enjoyable movie and worth of your time to watch it. i am on a journey too. the movie somehow represented some part of me and answered some of my questions.",1

"i just finished watching the 139 min version (widescreen) with some friends and we were blown away. i won't bother repeating what others have said. what the filmmakers do with the concept is unexpected and fun. the huge battle is exhausting. afterwards we were stunned to find there was still nearly 30 minutes left to go but that didn't keep us from being completely involved and entertained.  there is one thing that nearly ruined it and that was the horrific music/songs. blues, country/folk and rock ballads do not belong here and every time they are used we all broke out in laughter. it's hideous. you have been warned but the story and storytelling keeps you grounded.  there are several outstanding moments that make you appreciate the talent behind the camera. there are many uses of silence as well as slow-motion photography that work beautifully. i really wish i could erase the music but alas.  seek this out. it's fun, it's different and it takes you to places you wouldn't expect and that's very refreshing.",1
"i rented this film because of my interest in american history, and especially the somewhat weird story of the mormons. this movie attempts to make some sense out of how joseph smith could turn his ""vision"" into a major world religion. it first focuses on the troubles the mormons had in their settlement at navuoo, illinois. it portrays the trial of joseph smith. within the course of that trial, brigham young stands up to tell of his conversion to mormonism, and of his belief in the spiritual message of smith. then smith is assassinated, and young must deal with his own doubts about whether he has been chosen to lead the mormons to a new land. despite his grave doubts, he perseveres, and finally has a vision (that utah is the place for his colony) that gives him confidence in the rightness of his leadership. later, as crops are destroyed by crickets, he again doubts that he has truly been chosen--however, a miracle occurs, which cements his place in history.  i found the performances to be moving, and the story to be convincing and interesting. i would love to know whether mormons believe that this is an accurate portrayal. polygamy is a part of the story, but the reasons why this is central to lds are not raised. the issue is not emphasized.  i'm sure people stay away from this movie because of its religious subject-matter, but it has a great cast and will hold your interest throughout.",1
"this movie is up there with the all-time classics. the music, camera shots, and acting are excellent. showing the movie in black and white gave it a much better appearance and complemented the music perfectly, like psycho. its surprising how so few people have commented on this movie. my guess is that its a hard movie to find. i gave the film a 9. see the movie and you'll know what i'm talking about.",1
"this kind of storytelling is unacceptable the only reason this film is anywhere above the 5 stars out of 10 line is because it's got george lucas behind it, and it has the words ""star"" and ""wars"" in its title. that is an insult to aspiring filmmakers, and many others out there who have made clearly superior films with superior story, writing and acting, but did not get the credit. this is a travesty.  first things first. the story. anakin's evolution? there is none. apart from a little make-up around the eyes, and a little yelling, there is none. he becomes young, stupid, cocky anakin skywalker to darth vader in a single blow. the only thing consistent about darth vader in the original series was his intelligence, how good he was at almost everything he did, planning, fighting, you name it. the only consistent thing about anakin that is perceived in the prequel trilogy is his consistent stupidity. he even loses his body because of a bout of stupid cockiness.  what part of the emperor palpatine telling him legends of the sith does not point to the emperor being a sith? unacceptable!  the fight scenes used too many digital doubles. everyone's flying all over the place like teddy bears in a make-believe doll house. count dooku, emperor palpatine, anakin, obi-wan, almost every fighter had a rubbery digital double jumping around.  in one specific fight scene, obi-wan and anakin in the climactic battle, they both actually stop in the middle of parries and ripostes, to twirl their sabers a few times while inches apart. i realize the fights are choreographed, but that just got me shaking my head in disbelief and disgust.  the writing was awful. all the dialogue was of tremendously low quality. the good actors like ewan mcgregor and natalie portman did the best they could with their lines, but that just wasn't enough. i can't say enough bad things about this film. too much special effects, plot holes bigger than the centre of the universe, and absolutely no insights into any of the characters. this is the biggest mistake of this film: nothing new is offered. we know the rough picture of everything, all lucas did was colour it in.  we knew anakin lost his limbs. we knew luke and leia are brother and sister, we knew luke is anakin's son, we knew obi-wan and yoda go to exile, we knew everything. nothing new is offered in this film. if that's all the fans wanted, then that's fine, lucas couldn't have gone wrong.  but when anakin finally becomes darth vader, and he asks after padme, and hears she is dead, he reaches out his arms awkwardly and screams ""nooooooooooooooooooooo."" that scene screamed b-movie all the way, and i was half expecting darth vader to go ""danger will robinson, danger"" at any time. that is what this is. a b-movie, disguised by a huge budget and a ultra-loyalist fan base that will settle with anything now that the first two movies have pulled their standards down to the pits of the earth.",0
"  arriving by boxcar in new york city, the shrewd young woman with the baby face begins to methodically canoodle her way to the top floors of power in a great bank.  barbara stanwyck is fascinating as the amoral heroine of this influential pre-code drama. without a shred of decency or regret, she coolly manipulates the removal or destruction of the men unlucky enough to find themselves in her way. a wonderful actress, stanwyck has full opportunity here to display her ample talents.  appearing quite late in the story, george brent is a welcome addition as the one fellow possibly able to handle stanwyck; his sophisticated style of acting makes a nice counterpoint to her icy demeanor. douglas dumbrille, donald cook & henry kolker portray a succession of her unfortunate victims.  john wayne appears for just a few scant seconds as an unsuccessful suitor for stanwyck's affections. this would be the only time these two performers appeared together on screen.  movie mavens should recognize nat pendleton as a speakeasy customer, and charles sellon & edward van sloan as bank executives - all unbilled.  the music heard on the soundtrack throughout the film, perfectly punctuating the plot, is baby face' (1926) by benny davis & harry akst and st. louis blues' (1914) by w.c. handy.  baby face is a prime example of pre-code naughtiness. in its frank & unapologetic dealing with sex, it is precisely the kind of film which the implementation of the production code in 1934 was meant to eliminate.",1

"it's always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you, always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family. so, imagine that your older brother is santa and then imagine how tough that must be. that's the premise here.  vince vaughn plays the titular fred, an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people don't go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother, santa (played by paul giamatti), too much praise for simply being the limelight-hogging, fame-hungry, slightly creepy guy that fred would want to portray him as. then, wouldn't you know it, fred needs a financial favour and so has to make up for it by helping his brother on the run up to christmas. and hilarity and life lessons ensue.  well, that's what should happen. the reality is that we get a christmas movie featuring a few good moments of vaughn's patented fast-talking, a ridiculously out-of-nowhere music video moment, kevin spacey playing an auditor out to close down santa's operation (and he's one of the weakest baddies i have seen in some time), not enough of the gorgeous elizabeth banks in a lush christmas outfit, too much of john michael higgins in his elf outfit (to be fair, he's a highlight though) and a movie that's too swimming in bitterness to feel like good seasonal fare yet too schmaltzy in it's latter half to feel like a fun poke at all the bad things about the commercialism of the time.  rachel weisz is along for the ride too, as is kathy bates, but it's really nothing more than a movie for vaughn and if you like his style you will find something to enjoy here. unfortunately, there's very little else to recommend this seasonal stinker. outside of vaughn's rantings the script barely throws up anything decent with the exception of one particularly good scene involving a hilarious support group dealing with a very specific problem.  david dobkin's direction is as mediocre and staid as the 20p christmas card that you send the auntie you haven't seen in 10 years and he seems to think that simply putting the ingredients together without a good mix or decent care taken will guarantee a delicious christmas pudding. nope, we get a burnt, bland lump with too much sugar on top. forget this and stick the hilarious elf on again if you want a great, modern christmas comedy.  see this if you like: the santa clause 2, santa baby, the santa clause 3: the escape clause.",0
"i viewed this movie in dvd format. my copy may have been affected but i was disappointed with the lack of menu screen for the dvd. i will say that my initial reason for viewing this movie was claire forlani. while fun to watch, i feel she didn't live up to my expectations that i have so far found from her other films. i actually was equally pleased to see arkin turn in a humorous performance. the other two actors i wasn't very familiar with so i can't compare their performance, however they were fairly enjoyable also. the acting is the only endearing quality of this movie in my opinion. the story line, while some could say slightly compelling, lacked direction. i feel that the main problem stems from the script and not the direction of this film. if you enjoy any of these actors to a fair extent then i recommend this film, but otherwise leave it alone.",0
"steven spielberg produced, wrote, came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of amazing stories, so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right? unfortunately wrong. some episodes are just fantastic, but all too often it was a mixed bag. in fact, that might have been it's downfall is it was way too mixed. some episodes were light comedies, some were dramas, some were horror, and one was even animated, which made this a similar, but not as good 80s version of the twilight zone (which also was around).  normally i'd like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show, but they just didn't fully work here. some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they would be better being shown late on night on the lifetime network, like the episode ""ghost train"", which was directed by spielberg himself. in that episode, it gave the message of hope, and gave us a fantasy story, but overall it was just a build up to the ending which didn't blow me away anyways. the horror episodes tended to work better than the drama, but there were far more dramatic ones, and they grow tiring to watch. acting wise, this anthology got some big stars, similar to the original twilight zone. kevin costner, kiefer sutherland, milton berle, dom deluise, harvey keitel, beau bridges, charlie sheen, forrest whitaker, tim robbins, john lithgow, rhea perlman, danny devito, patrick swayze, christopher lloyd, june lockhart, kathy baker, weird al yankovich and many other well knowns have been in episodes of the show. it's fun to see well known actors in almost every episode of the series. great directors have also had part in episodes including spielberg himself, clint eastwood, burt reynolds, bob clark, joe dante, mick garris, paul bartel, joe dante, robert zemeckis, danny devito and even martin scorsese. i'd actually recommend this more to fans of the directors and/or the 80s than anyone else.  amazing stories was sometimes amazing, usually good, occasionally mediocre, and every once in a while a real stinker came out. but, this show has nostalgic value to me, and it's sort of fun to sit on boring afternoons and watch some episodes. john williams' theme music for the show is sure to be caught in anyone's head who watches this, too.  my rating: good show. 30 mins. per episode. tvpg",1
"i have a 5 minute rule (sometimes i'll leave leway for 10). if a movie is not good in the first 5 or 10 minutes it's probably not going to ever get better. i have yet to experience any movie that has proved to contest this theory. dan in real life is definitely no exception. i was watching this turkey and thought; wow, this is not funny, not touching, not sad, and i don't like any of the characters at all.  the story of an advice columnist/widower raising three young daughters, who falls in love with his brothers girlfriend. i suppose the tagline would be ""advice columnist who could use advice""? i don't know. dans character in no way struck me as someone qualified to give advice. i guess that's the irony? i don't know. he goes to see his parents, brothers, sisters and their kids at some sort of anual family retreat, which seems very sweet, and potential fodder for good comedy, story lines...none which ever emerge. the central story is basically how he loves this woman, but can't have her. anyone with a pulse will realise that eventually he will get her, but you have to suffer through painfully unfunny, trite, lifetime movie network dialogue ""murderer of love"" to get to the inevitable happy ending.  this is truly one of the worst movies i've ever seen.",0
this movie is sort of a carrie meets heavy metal. it's about a highschool guy who gets picked on alot and he totally gets revenge with the help of a heavy metal ghost. it is such a classic. the soundtrack is a++++. you've got living legends of metal in it. and marc price was great in this film. this is a must have for metal fans.,1

"this is an interesting left turn for reel 13 indies. two harbors is a b&w 75 minute film from minnesota that features non-actors and is about two people finding a connection through a search for alien life. i applaud the boldness of the reel 13 programmers of thinking out-of-the-box when selecting this film. i just wish they had picked a stronger film to be bold with. as a matter of fact, i wonder if the choice had more to do with the uniqueness of the film than with the actual quality of the film itself (not that two harbors is completely without merit, but i'll get to that a little later).   as is common with independent films, two harbors is limited in terms of location. there are only two real locations  a large junk dealership market and a very teeny trailer, which is the home of the middle-aged main character, vic, played by alex cole. writer/director james vculek uses the market setting to provide exposition about vic, who is one of the dealers there. he has various people walk up to vic and start very long conversations that provides us with just two pieces of information  vic sells space toys (he prefers to call them ""outer space action figures"") and he is a caustic asshole. this is emblematic of one of the two key problems with two harbors - all the chatting. i've said it before and i'll say it again  we are dealing with a visual medium and filmmakers need to work harder to tell their stories visually. there are exceptions, of course, but generally, endless patter is not so engaging on film  particularly if the dialogue is being used as exposition. pretty much all the conversations in the film are long and unnecessarily verbose. a notable example would be a few scenes which feature vic trying to play himself off as a boy scout leader in order to get a discount at a store. he argues with the clerk back and forth and these scenes don't even advance the plot one iota. this is the kind of thing that makes even a 75 minute film feel long.  the other problem with two harbors is the acting. i may be a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to performance in film, but i really don't feel like there's a good excuse for not having good actors in your films. there are plenty of good actors out there, many of which willing to work on low-budget projects  even in minnesota. many filmmakers eschew the importance of acting ability as being secondary to their visuals, but that is naïve. in narrative film-making, next to the story, nothing is more important than the acting/performances. if you don't believe the people enacting your story, your audience is lost.  originally, i thought vculek was using non-actors, but as the film went on, i decided that they were probably community theater-type actors. it wasn't that they were uncomfortable on camera. it's that they were overly theatrical (i.e. big). granted, the best of the actors were the two leads  cole and catherine e. johnson as cassie, a lonely young girl that gets caught up in vic's extra-terrestrial hunt. they seemed to have the most training, but they were still a little rough around the edges. the eccentricities they displayed seemed to be surface only - not coming from a real, organic place within. ms. johnson, in particular, is an interesting case. she definitely has a presence  a midwestern charm about her, but that charisma belies the multitude of issues her character is supposed to have. she struggles to portray the idiosyncrasies that stem from a supposed life of solitude and (slave?) labor, relying on stock gestures like eye rolls, lip biting and stammering to suggest her discomfort with the outside world.  i mentioned in the first paragraph that two harbors is not completely without merit and here's what i mean. without giving too much away, there is a fade to white an hour into the film. after that, the story takes a stunning turn, which allows the last fifteen minutes to be evocative and downright powerful  it's like a sucker punch to the gut, but in a good way. it's almost a huge relief to feel something after so long with these characters. the last five minutes of the film don't have any dialogue at all and the result is the best part of the film  subtle, detailed (cole does his best work of the film) and most importantly, cinematic. then, with the closing credits comes the most staggering revelation of all  that it's based on a true story, which got me to thinking. with all the dialogue, the minimal locations and the lack of cinematic qualities, it occurred to me that with two kick ass actors and a tightening re-write, two harbors might make a really kick-ass stage play  maybe even a one-act. if there are any bold theater producers out there reading this, i definitely recommend seeing if you can get a hold of the film and contact the filmmaker, reel 13 or whomever. there might be something to this story after all  (for more information on this or any other reel 13 film, check out their website at www.reel13.org)",0

"the greatest games of kasparov or fischer can be a mess for a total rookie. this is a great movie. there is no special agency involved in the plot. this is the clue! this is a private plot, built as a private enterprise. this is a self-destructive and a self organized plot. as a conclusion, the scenario described the perfect professional plot: private, self organized, self-destructive, with no trace at the end. anyone can be behind the plot: a smart ""director"" with some money. all can be done just by delegation. the ""director"" must be just trigger. if the normal viewer cannot see the essence of the plot in the explicit sequences of the movie, a real plot has fewer chances to be discovered. all the actors' performances are well done , with some special mention for gene hackman and mickey rooney.",1
"why am i so convinced there's actually another film version of this novel out there somewhere? i saw the film again this year as i am teaching the novel and find the changes in the film annoying - there is no appearance of the little boy in the novel and the ending has been changed. they kill him off in the film but the whole point is that he is haunted by the events at eel marsh house for many years but does remarry and eventually put the events behind him. mr. bentley is a far more sympathetic character in the novel, the scene in the film where kipps sets fire to the office is plain daft, and the constant appearance of the toy soldier to signify the presence of the child is genuinely creepy but pointless - kipps is haunted by the woman seeking revenge, not the child. i am sure i've seen a film which is better and closer to the novel and actually scarier. have i just imagined this?",1
"we viewed the vcr and found it to be fascinating. not knowing anything about this true story, i thought: ""oh, no, p.brosnan as an american indian ('red' indian in the film), what a bad choice"" until i discovered the truth about grey owl. the film does a good job of demonstrating the dignity of these native peoples and undermining the racist myths about them. and annie galipeau, wow, what a beauty, and very convincing as an indian woman (i believe she is french-canadian; she sure reverts to the all-too familiar speech of such). in spite, of brosnan's detached, grunting style, in the end he comes through convincingly as a passionate, dedicated man. the plot is a little weak in demostrating his conversion from trapper to animal coservationist. good film, highly recommended.",1
"i see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story, and i thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it. the fact that they basically came up with excuses -- rewrites, budget constraints, production formats etc -- simply underlines how bad this movie is. and my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesn't make the cut.  it's watchable, but barely so. there are plot holes in every corner, the dialogue borders on the ridiculous, and the ending is telegraphed a mile away. the modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly dialogue like who makes a meal in the midst of what is supposed to be a tense and deadly encounter with an unknown enemy. would ya wrassle us up some hamburger helper sally, between us getting killed by these automated carpet sweepers? apparently this elite team equipped with the latest gizmos and red plastic tubed wonder armor has no access to mres. once they get into the last rooms they treat the place more like a four star motel than a deadly encounter zone.  the rationale for the encounter with the fearsome rook is that it can't be killed single handedly. yet only one scene ago, the hero making that case abandoned king to do exactly that. huh? vivian woo was attractive and hands down the best acted character in the movie. but that's not saying much.",0
"i got this movie out of blockbuster in one of those racks were you can get like 5 movies for 20 bucks. i'd have to say i got my money's worth on this one. i had expected horrible dialogue, crappy monsters, and shaky cameras. well, as meatloaf said, two outta three ain't bad.  the acting is bad, though not as bad as some movies i've seen. or maybe i've watched so many low budget movies recently i've lost perspective. there are some bits were the acting is downright terrible, but for the most part it's of at least high school play level.  the cg for the sasquatch in this movie is probably the second-worst part. the first thing i thought when i saw it (and i noticed another reviewer agreed with me) was that a man in an ape suit would have been better. clunky stop-motion animation would have looked better.  so you may be asking why i call the cg the second-worst part. that's because the very worst part of the movie is the sound effects. they are loud, annoying, and constant. i've been camping, i know what insects sound like in the woods at night, and while they can be loud, they're not deafening like the cacophony in this movie. usually when the ""background"" sounds drown out the movie's dialogue, it's a bad thing, but from what i caught of the dialogue of this film, i wasn't missing much.  the action was infrequent and boring. the tension was non-existent, as was any sense of empathy with the characters. speaking of the characters, they were all cookie-cutter and bland. the only mildly engaging byplay was between...actually, i can't think of anything. there was a line or two that made me crack a wan smile, but that was about it.  the cinematography was decent, a step or two above what you'd normally see in a movie like this. however, it still had that ""home movie"" quality to it that you get with movies made on pocket change and a prayer.   if you're like me and get a kick out of shoestring budget genre flicks, and you see this one in the dollar bin, think about grabbing it. otherwise, stay away at all costs.",0
"this film is really vile. it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s/80s and puts it into a school context. i'm not saying that urban crime wasn't a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren't/aren't problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit. violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it's not a case of social issues but a white, upper-middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol. and of course he knows how to play the system. does that sound familiar. yes. this turd is pure violent exploitation, a really nasty piece of work. it's disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment. this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator, death wish 2-5 and so on and so on. the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this.",0

"like watching a neighbor's summer camp home movies, ""indian summer"" is a sleep inducing bore. eight alumni campers are barely introduced, when unbelievably boring flashbacks begin for characters we know nothing about. fine actors, alan arkin, and bill paxton are totally wasted in this film. one camper's observation that ""everything seems so much smaller than i remember it"" is repeated at least ten times, enough to make you squirm. the anticipated pranks are neither funny or original, unless you think that short sheeting is a real ""howler"". this movie was a great disappointment considering the ample talent involved.

"i first heard of this movie after purchasing the 1976 flick ""snuff"". i was told that devil's experiment was much better so naturally i went ahead and ordered the guinea pig box set. i was really interested to hear that charlie sheen had come out trying to ban either this movie or the second one, so my interest was peaked.  devil's experiment is a short film with no story, no character development. just 3 men torturing a woman for about 45 minutes. they torture her in various ways like beating her, spinning her in circles over and over again then forcing her to drink alcohol, forcing her to listen to hi-pitched noise for 24 hours, smash her hand with a mallet, burning and putting maggots on the burns, throwing guts at her, and ultimately shoving a sharp needle through her eye.  i must say that a lot of this movie was fake, like the beating scenes. but then, some of it was actually well done as far as grossing you out. the scenes in which the woman is being spun around in circles was making me dizzy watching it. or the scene in which she is forced to listen to sharp noise for 24 hours is painful to think about. the worst is the eye scene. i didn't shutter when watching it but simply thought ""damn, that looks pretty good for such a low budget movie"". i did enjoy the flick but i don't know if i can really recommend this unless you have seen most of what the horror genre has to offer. 7/10",1
"to be as honest as i possibly can, the devil's plaything (or veil of blood or vampire ecstasy or the curse of the black sisters or) is a complete bore. the movie has a good premise behind it  the resurrection of a long dead vampire through the body of a descendant through the aid and assistance of a group of women dressed in black  but the execution is horrible. there are great, long moments of screen time when literally nothing happens. characters just stand around with nothing to do. there's no mystery, no suspense, and no plot points to care about. the acting is simply abysmal. most of the acting involves a group of below average looking women dancing naked while staring at the camera. they do this repeatedly. and what little plot there is seems to be designed to get more of these less than attractive women naked so they can join in the dancing. while it's not as bad or pointless as the dancing or the plot in something like orgy of the dead, it comes close.",0
"the plot of "" astronuat returns to earth as a mutating monster "" died out in the 1950s mainly down to the scientific fact that travelling outside the earth's orbit doesn't humans cause to turn in to mutated monsters , and that the first film to use this plot the quatermass experiment was the only decent sci-fi movie to use the idea . so the idea of having the redundant plot return seems doomed from the start . alas watching the incredible melting man it seems the plot is the least of its problems   first of all this is an incredibly badly made movie . the budget is in single figures and i'm talking about lira not dollars . there is no cinematography to speak of and there's countless editing blunders . for example a photographer takes his ( barely legal ) model for a photo shoot . cut to a shot where the sun is directly behind model , then cut to shot of photographer where the sun is directly behind him, then cut back to the model where the sun is ...  the lack of budget drags the film down in other aspects too . according to the trivia page the budget was so low the producers couldn't get any stock footage of saturn so when astronaut steve west mentions how beautiful saturn looks we get footage of the sun . actually the sun gives the most impressive performance in the film since the human actors wouldn't be employed by a porn studio . if i was appearing in this i wouldn't be scared by the eponymous monster - i'd be terrified of splinters from the rest of the cast . perhaps we should be slightly forgiving though since the obvious lack of budget manifests itself in things like the actors having to wear their own clothes . a general for instance doesn't wear his nice fancy dress uniform complete with medals - he wears a denim jacket and baseball cap   there has to be suspension of disbelief for a film like this to work but it fails on every level . the tone is set early on in the film where mr melty murders a nurse and escapes from the hospital . instead of the police getting a call saying there's been a murder dr nelson just decides to track down his patient on his own own same as he'd look for a missing cat . it's also strange a thoroughly decomposing homicidal monster can walk down the road without anyone noticing , but this is typical of a film where horny 70 year olds stop their car down dark roads for a quickie and people nonchalantly mention their wife is pregnant whilst forgetting to tell the police that there's a monster on the loose .  the incredible melting man is z grade rubbish . i can certainly understand why people enjoy this movie because it does reach the heights of "" it's so bad it's good "" but apart from rick baker's sometimes impressive make up effects it's nothing more than a very guilty pleasure",0

"on paper this looked like a great concept: average guy on the rebound dates up tight bookish museum curator, who is really a hot superhero who saves the world on a regular basis. however, director ivan reitman and writer don payne (of the ""simpson's"") almost fatally miscalculate in having their hero g-girl (played by striking uma thurman) come off as a total nut job as both superhero and secret identity persona jenny johnson. the movie even cops to this in a conversation between jenny and matt saunders (luke wilson) following his rescue by g-girl from the statue of liberty. jenny curiously asks matt what was g-girl like. matt replies, ""she's kind of nutty"" i think the intent was to have jenny (thurman) be this lonely young woman, who has no one in her life, isolated by her great physical powers. thurman does the best she can, but her jenny is a terrifying mood swing in dire need of prozac. luke wilson is way too breezy in the role reversal of boyfriend and superhero girl friend.  ""my super ex-girlfriend"" is also a victim of bad timing, coming on the tail end of ""superman returns"" which plays superhero straight up, so to speak. with all its quirks and inconsistent writing i still thought ""my super ex-girlfriend"" was funny and enjoyed the movie. given that this is an ivan reitman movie, this could have been a lot better. reitman starts with a great premise, and really squanders it. first off, we all love the hero. here neither jenny nor g-girl is really all that likable. this is surprising for uma thurman, who is normally a charismatic and powerful presence. in the beginning her jenny/ g-girl is just plain weird. shocking. because if there is a woman who can play a superhero, she is thurmanshe looks great. only toward the end does her jenny become more sympathetic, instead of caricature. although ""my super ex"" is not a straight superhero story, rather a romantic comedy of sorts, it does not provide what every superhero mythology requiresa great super villain. here we have professor bedlam aka barry (eddie izzard) who really is evil lite. he is no lex luthor. no plans for global domination. bedlam rather barry does hold a grudge against g-girl, and expectedly it has to do with their shared past. what is bizarre you don't know who you would rather spend time withbedlam or g-girl? luke wilson's matt is just ""some dude"" who happens to hook up with the psycho superhero. one of the annoying things he does is that he confides in his repugnant loser friend vaughn (rainn wilson doing a bad whacked out impersonation). wilson sometimes plays it a little too dense, and this dilutes his likable charm. this does however work, in the comic sex scene with jenny. matt while dating jenny/ g-girl realizes that he is in love with his co-worker hannah (perky anna faris). so how does matt break up with g-girl? well, it's not pretty and for the most part hilarious.  dramatic superhero movies work. romantic comedies with chemistry work. what may be inherently difficult are superhero satires disguised as romantic comedies. everyone loves the hero. however, hero nut job? maybe not. with all uma thurman's talent she is unable to accomplish this convincingly. and she does not get sufficient support from reitman and payne. thurman and wilson have enough charm and presence to survive their narrative failings. ""my super ex-girlfriend"" is fun and funny. though given all involved, the movie could have been super.",1
"as seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (i watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth.  firstly the characters are all pretty dull. i got a hint of a kind of laputa situation between agito, toola and the main antagonist shunack. however maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (laputa being my favourite animé, original engilsh dub). the characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old minka jealous and rejected (she loves agito, who seems oblivious of this). however she promptly seems to forgive toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more ""happy"".   there is also a serious lack of explanation. like who are the druids really? are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? there is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. the plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. it is almost like a weird version of the day of the triffids.  and who does call toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained?  i really wanted to like this film but i found the plot no where near as deep as a film like ghost in the shell or having any real character like those of miyazaki. i do not resent watching it but i do sort of wish i hadn't bought it. my advice? give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! perhaps if your new to animé films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. it certainly is visually pleasing.",0
"lots of reviews on this page mention that this movie is a little dark for kids. that depends on the kid. this isn't a movie for a 2-6 year old; it's more geared toward the 8 years and older crowd. i saw this movie when i was 10, i absolutely loved it. at the time most animated movies were a little too childish for my tastes. this movie deals with more serious issues, and therefore has a little more emotional impact. in this movie characters can die, and be sent to hell! this gives a little more emotional weight to the scenes where characters are risking their lives. the good guys aren't always perfectly sweet and nice (like other cartoons). they have ""real"" motivations, like revenge, and greed, but also compassion and friendship; shows that things aren't always black and white.  excellent movie",1
"imagine the big chill with a cast of twenty-somethings whose characters are all unlikable, and an iguana-like man-lizard chasing them around and you have an idea of the foolishness herein. on the positive side, the movie does not skimp on showing the monster. there's no peek-a-boo shots, or nighttime scenes where you have to imagine what he looks like; he's right out there folks. unfortunately, the design and construction aren't that inspired. a little bit of mystery might have helped. mind you, i've seen far worse, but if you're going to have him out on full display for a lot of the flick, your monster better look damn good.   spoiler ahead!!!  oh, and there's a twist ending involving the supposedly dead brother that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. this came as no surprise given the shoddy writing of the script. as for the acting; well let's just say it wasn't painfully bad, but i don't expect we'll be seeing many of these kids in future cinematic outings.  gore quotient: 2 out of 5; nudity quotient: 1 out of 5; intelligence quotient: negligible",0

as most off you might off seen star wars: return off the jedi you may knows its a good movie but as you might have seen on video they m|might have a party at the end and they just probably end the movie with the party with no a spirits or anything but on the original one (live tv) when they are partying but before i say more when ben obi-wan dies in the imperial ship or death star they saw him disappear and yoda dies from either old age or internal illness but because luke killed darth vader (real name: anakin skywalker) when they all are partying at the end when luke or someone stops the spirits off ben and yoda stands starring at him and smiling while another spirit appears is its darth vader but not as a sith as the old usual selve off him and started smiling with ben and yoda i reckon that made the movie ending a little bit interesting but the producers or anyone should off made a spirit off padme and mace windu and other jedis that got killed with younglings under there arms in the back ground,1

"my title above says it all. let me make it clearer. if you have seen the bbc's ""planet earth"" , which i am sure most of you have , then you are not gonna like this movie too much. and i own all the discs of ""planet earth"" i had seen the rating for this movie very high , and read good reviews about it. i was excited to check it out.  alas, i went to the theater and the movie started , i saw it was a disney movie with production companies listing bbc and discovery. and when they started the first scenes about the polar bear, i recognized them from my dvds at home of ""planet earth"".  the movie continued and went on and on and on , me and my friends kept on recognizing the scenes were all from ""planet earth"".  we were very very disappointed , as i think 90% of the footage is from ""planet earth"" . i am saying 90% , because some of the scenes i didn't recognize. i have a feeling that i simply didn't remember them.  so finally what this movie really is , is a compilation of different footages from the different discs of ""planet earth"" , with a narration aimed at kids. yes, the narration is quite kiddish. let me give you an example. when they show the polar cubs walking away from the mother cub , the narrator says ""the polar cubs are not like human kids. they don't always listen to their mothers"" ( i don't remember the exact words , but this is how it is ) so in a nutshell. this is condensed ""planet earth"" for kids !",0
"warning: review contains mild spoilers  a couple of years back i managed to see the first five films in this franchise, and was planning to do an overview of the whole elm st. series. however, just two years on and i find i can't remember enough about them in order to do it  i guess they couldn't have made much of an impression. from what i do recall, some of the sequels  dream warriors in particular  weren't as bad as is often made out, though even the original was no classic. generally, the predictability of the premise (if people fall asleep they get murdered in their dreams) doesn't lend itself to narrative tension. but while i cannot recall much of the first five films, i do know they never plumbed the depths of freddy's dead.  an indication of how sick of freddy the public was at this point can be judged by the fact that the film was promoted solely on the character's demise. the fact that the movie's conclusion is not even hidden, but in fact the entire purpose for the film's being goes to illustrate how vacant, soulless and cynical this venture was.  taking the morally questionable idea of having a child molester as the charismatic villain, robert englund's in-no-way-scary interpretation booms with laughter. i always thought freddy's mockery of the teenage victims was less aimed at the characters than at the teenage audience that could ever watch this tripe. it's like englund's crying out ""we know this is garbage  but you're paying to see it, so who's the one laughing?"" and i'm sure victims of child abuse would be disheartened to see such an insensitive depiction of their plight. was freddy's appearance in the films always so rudimentary? all he gets to do here is a few ""haaaaaaaaaaaaaarr  har  har  hars"" and that's it. if this was the only elm st. film you'd ever seen you wouldn't get to know the character at all. even as the character pre-death in a flashback englund plays him as a boo-hiss pantomime villain with a slop of transatlantic (ie. overstated, misplaced and not at all funny) irony.  acting is almost universally poor. just look at how many times breckin meyer overacts with his hand gestures and body language. only kananga himself, yaphet kotto, keeps his dignity. and when roseanne, tom arnold and alice cooper show up, you can almost visibly see the film sinking further into the mire. the script, too, is absolutely lousy, almost wholly without merit. carlos (ricky dean logan) opens a road map, upon which the noel coward-like freddy has wittily written ""you're f**ked"". when prompted for the map, carlos responds ""well the map says we're f**ked"". who wrote the screenplay, oscar wilde?  or how about the scene where carlos is tortured by freddy, his hearing enhanced to painful levels? so freddy torments him by threatening to drop a pin  a potentially fatal sound, given that all sounds are magnified. oddly, the fact that carlos shouts at the top of his voice for him not to drop it seems to have no effect. ""nice hearing from you, carlos"", quips freddy, hoping some better lines will come along. it's also worth noting that dream sleep doesn't occur instaneously, so being knocked unconscious wouldn't allow instant access into freddy's world. though as part of the narrative contains a human computer game and a 3-d finale plot logic isn't that high on the list of requirements.  the teenagers heading the cast this time are really the most obnoxious, dislikeable group in the whole series. tracy (lezlie deane) is the only one who gets to greet freddy with ""shut the f**k up, man"" and a kick in the scallops. and was incongruous pop music always part of the ingredients? freddy's dead. no laughs. no scares. no interest. no fun.

"after stopping by the movie store to find something to watch, we stumbled on this. it looked appealing from the summary, at least, so we gave it a try. and here's the kicker: the first 20 minutes are interesting! it's actually enjoyable! oh, wait, spoke too soon.  somewhere in there, the movie took a disgusting turn into fundamental, right-wing christian brain-washing. not entirely sure what happens, but i think the screenplay writer found god somewhere in there, finished writing this script, and had no time to edit it because he had a kkk meeting to get to with his friends from the westboro church and his hood wasn't clean.  can they put warnings on this? i refuse to support this religious idiocy. much like video games have rating systems, movies need some sort of symbol: maybe a small cross in the bottom corner to show us that a movie is going to take a turn for the worse.  unless you share sentiments with whatever moron came up with this story, and will have your bible open in your lap while you watch this and plan on how you'll convert your neighbors, don't waste your time. it's some of the worst junk that's come out in a very long time, and the radical religious nuts don't need anymore funding.",0
"this movie is one of the worst ones of the year. the main characters have no chemistry and the acting is horrible. paul rudd is the only one that has any talent, and the only one that is not annoying. i have never watched desparte housewives, so i don't know how eva longoria is on that show, but in this movie she was horrible. it's like she knows nothing about acting. all her character does is whine throughout the film, and she can't pull off being a b**** and still be entertaining. and the other girl, lake bell, displays little emotion and it's like you are looking at the cue cards as she reads them.  as for the story, it is so cookie cutter. it goes from point a to b with little surprise. so much more could have been used with kate as a ghost. the plot should have revolved more around her and the things she does as a spirit.  final verdict: it's not worth watching.",0
"hitokiri (which translates roughly as ""assassination""), a/k/a ""tenchu"" which translates roughly as ""divine punishment"") showcases hideo gosha at the top of his form. do not miss this one, or gosha's other classic, goyokin! hitokiri is not only one of gosha's best films, it's one of the best ""samurai/chambara"" films ever made, and perhaps one of the best japanese films ever exported.  be warned, all of the intricate plot details in hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century japanese history. even so, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. as per the norm for gosha, hitokiri provides yet another variation on his traditional theme of ""loyalty to one's lord"" vs. ""doing the right thing"". however, gosha develops his favorite theme with such sophistication, that it's really _the_ movie to see (along with goyokin, of course).  i suppose it breaks down like this: if you want a simpler, more action-oriented tale, you might want to see goyokin. however, if you want a more thoughtful, multilayered (albeit grim) drama, see this one.  (ok, ok, essentially, the historical backdrop is a massive power grap between many different samurai clans who are either (1) working to reform, yet retain, the tokugawa shogunate, and (2) those who are trying to install the emperor meiji as the supreme ruler of japan. of course, those clans working ""for"" emperor meiji were often less interested in ""reforming"" japan than in ensuring their own clan more power in the ""new world order"". ironically, the entire feudal system was officially abolished as one of the first reforms of the meiji government. it's ironic twists like this -- gosha's big on irony -- that make the entire plot all the more bittersweet.)  what distinguishes ""hitokiri"" from gosha's other movies is gosha's mature sense of cinematography. every shot is thoughtfully composed, and (much like kubrick's barry lyndon) each frame of the movie could hold its own as a still composition. of course, this is typical gosha. hitokiri really stands out with stunning backdrops, including(as with goyokin) many riveting seascapes. just watch the opening sequence, and you're hooked! make no mistake, this is no english period piece: hitokiri is extremely violent (don't say you weren't warned).  what else, other than cool camera work, makes hitokiri stand out? the performances seem (to me) a bit more subtle in this one. katsu shintaro (of zatoichi/hanzo the razor fame) turns in a star performance as the conflicted protagonist/antihero, okada izo. katsu manages to instill humanity to a character that seems almost more wild animal than villain. throughout the movie, you're never quite sure if you're engaged or revolted by okada's character. at the same time, katsu's portrayal of okada's ravenous hunger for respect, and his later pathetic attempts at redemption, seem so human that you can't help but feel empathy/sympathy. of course, after seeing nakadai tatsuya play the tortured hero in ""goyokin"", it's great to see him play such a ruthless villain in ""hitokiri"". he's just perfect, there's nothing more to say!  as a final note, perhaps more interesting to buffs than to casual fans, don't miss the last screen appearance of mishima yukio (yes, the closeted gay right-wing ultranationalist novelist who committed suicide by seppuku before the crowd of jeering japanese military personnel he ""kidnapped"" in 1970, and had a movie on his life and work made by paul schrader), who actually does a pretty solid job of portraying the honorable (for an assassin) shinbei tanaka.",1
"movies about dinosaurs can be entertaining. so can whoopi goldberg movies. but whoopi and dinosaurs?  after the first 20 minutes of ""theodore rex"", i had come to one conclusion: this movie is evil. evil, vile, wicked and reprehensible in its spite for the audience. nothing this bad is made by accident; this is the visual equivalent of a torture chamber.  first of all, whoopi does not make good action movies (watch ""fatal beauty"" if you think i'm lying), but the film makers don't care - she's a tough cop here, yet again.   seen a million cop buddy flicks this week? well, here's number one million and one, pal.  don't like cute, humanistic animated dinosaurs since that spielberg tv show about them? too bad, here's another one and he's a cop, too!  you one of those people that hates car chases, shoot-outs, sloppy dialogue, boring futuristic fx and seeing talented people (goldberg, mueller-stahl, roundtree) stuck in a movie that looks like a tax write-off? a big tax write-off?  and you read this review all the way to the end. you deserve a sequel. seriously.  no stars, not a one. and if they really make a sequel to ""theodore rex"", hollywood deserves to be attacked a whole herd of wise-cracking foam rubber dinosaurs.  now, i'd pay to see that.",0
"first of all, let's get a few things straight here: a) i am an anime fan- always has been as a matter of fact (i used to watch speed racer all the time in preschool). b) i do like several b-movies because they're hilarious. c) i like the godzilla movies- a lot.  moving on, when the movie first comes on, it seems like it's going to be your usual b-movie, down to the crappy fx, but all a sudden- boom! the anime comes on! this is when the movie goes wwwaaaaayyyyy downhill.  the animation is very bad & cheap, even worse than what i remember from speed racer, for crissakes! in fact, it's so cheap, one of the few scenes from the movie i ""vividly"" remember is when a bunch of kids run out of a school... & it's the same kids over & over again! the fx are terrible, too; the dinosaurs look worse than godzilla. in addition, the transition to live action to animation is unorganized, the dialogue & voices(especially the english dub that i viewed) was horrid & i was begging my dad to take the tape out of the dvd/ vhs player; the only thing that kept me surviving was cracking out jokes & comments like the robots & joel/mike on mst3k (you pick the season). honestly, this is the only way to barely enjoy this movie & survive it at the same time.  heck, i'm planning to show this to another fellow otaku pal of mine on halloween for a b-movie night. because it's stupid, pretty painful to watch & unintentionally hilarious at the same time, i'm giving this movie a 3/10, an improvement from the 0.5/10 i was originally going to give it.

"a film that can make you shed tears of sadness and tears of joy would be considered quite a step in the career of a common filmmaker. the fact is, steven spielberg, probably our greatest story-teller, has been doing this in various movie formats for years. the color purple, at the time, was considered risky, especially after action classics like jaws and raiders of the lost ark. in hindsight, this film should have come as no surprise, for spielberg had made us cry tears of joy and sadness in e.t. critics called color purple his entrance into intellectual fare. it is quite an entrance. no special effects, no swashbuckling, just brilliant story-telling based on a literary classic by alice walker. one surprise is how spielberg could present such a moving film about african-americans in the deep south. slavery is gone, but in the south depicted here, it seems as though blacks are using other blacks as slaves.   spielberg is always put down for sentimentalizing his pictures or adding an element of childishness to please the audience. this is really the first of overlooked films from his career that you cannot make these observations. it is the first in a line of films people either didn't see or wouldn't see because there are no aliens. empire of the sun, always, schindler's list, etc.. his awesome talent is obvious with this specific picture because a) he uses mostly untrained, first-time actors, b) he tackles a subject most felt was unadaptable to the screen, and c) it is pure drama with no strings pulled where characters grow and change over the passage of roughly 30 years. it is almost epic-like in look and scope and the fact that it did not garner a single academy award from 11 nominations is a travesty and an insult.  whoopi goldberg is fabulous as the tortured celie, an unattractive woman given away by her incestuous father to an abusive danny glover, who she only knows as ""mister"". the film follows a path of occasional beatings and mental torture she goes through while with ""mister"". the pg-13 rated film is pretty open to the sexual issues raised by the walker novel. this is not ""the burning bed"" in georgia by any means. there is no blatant revenge taken as might be expected. it happens gracefully. goldberg perfectly plays a human being, someone in need of love and someone who deserves it. the films' most poignant and heartbreaking moment comes when goldberg and her sister, nettie (played by akosua busia) are separated, maybe forever. (possibly foreshadowing holocaust separation of child and parent?) you may have to check for a pulse if you are not moved by this sequence.  the color purple stands for the beauty of the fields and flowers surrounding these poor people. there really is something to live for, but love triumphs over all. spielberg bashers take note: the guy can make an unforgettable classic without any cute aliens.  rating: 10 of 10",1

"as a pagan, i must say this movie has little if any magickal significance. it's a ""fun"" witchcraft movie and not meant to teach us anything except that love is the strongest magick of all, and never to use it in a controlling or vengeful way. that's a lesson everyone needs to learn, not just pagans.  that having been said, this movie is wonderfully written and sweetly executed by kim novak and the venerable jimmy stewart.  hermione gingold delivers a stellar performance as bianca, elsa lanchester (with too many movie credits to mention except as ms. jane marbles of ""murder by death"") was wonderful as ms. novak's absent-minded-yet-capable upstairs neighbor queenie. also starring jack lemmon (wonderful performance) and jim kovacs (brilliantly witty).  ""witches can't cry. why, they can't shed a single tear because their heart is full of magick. they don't have time for silly things such as love."" queenie.  gillian holroyd (novak) and her brother nicky (jack lemmon) are manhattan witches. cloaked deeply within the secret underworld of those of the craft, they live among other new yorkers as one of them, without so much as causing a raised eyebrow.   but then, along comes shepherd ""shep"" henderson (stewart), a steadfast, no-nonsense, dedicated businessman who is engaged to be married to gillian's old college rival.   by a quirky mishap of chance, he finds himself moving into gillian's building and is instantly ""bewitched"" by her charm and grace. by the use of magick, with a little help from pyewacket (gillian's familiar, trained by robert e. blair) and queenie, gillian begins to work on this handsome new dream man to get back at her old enemy.  but magick should never be used to control, nor to hurt, and gillian learns that the hard way in the most bittersweet way. not only does she have to face what she's done, but she has to face shep in her guilt.   from the critical perspective; however, the movie takes a serious turn: the effects are very dated to the point of being pure camp. some of the scenery was seemingly shot in the basement of someone's small home, but at least the characters were quirky and fun.  on a personal note, pyewacket steals the show. great cat! great training by robert e. blair.   as a note of trivia, this is the roots for the beloved bewitched television sitcom. this introduces the original samantha and darrin. all the characters of note are present and accounted for. you have but to look, to see it for yourself.  this is one of my favorites, and i watch it often.  this movie gets a 9.1/10 from...  the fiend :.",1
"well let me say that i have always been a steven seagal fan and his movies are usually great but this just don't measure up to the rest. this in my opinion is very stupid i did not like it all. the biggest reason i don't like it is because it is very flawed and to me does not make much sense. the acting is very bad even steven seagal does not do good acting, the rest of the actors i can see because they just do direct to video movies. it does not follow a straight storyline everything happens at once so that why it doesn't make much sense. ther is barely any action in it at all and in order to make an action movie good you usually need action in it. the special effects are very bad and you can tell are fake. so all in all this has to seagals worst movie of all so if you want to see a steven seagal movie don't rent this one just pretend it does not exist. so just avoid this movie.  overall score: ** out of **********   * out of *****",0
"this stirring western spins the tale of the famous rifle of the early west that was coveted by one and all. james stewart is the cowboy who wins the prized winchester in a shootout, only to lose it in a robbery. the story details stewart's pursuit of the rifle and a certain man through the film. the rifle changes hands time after time, as though the owner is fated to lose it through violence. the picture has plenty of action and suspense as stewart closes in on his quarry. a great cast supports stewart here, namely stephen mcnally, dan duryea, millard mitchell, john mcintire and jay c. flippen. shelley winters seems miscast here and the purpose of her role is rather obscure. tony curtis and rock hudson, teen heartthrobs in later years, have brief but good roles.",1
"i always have a bit of distrust before watching the british period films because i usually find on them insipid and boring screenplays (such as the ones of, for example, vanity fair or the other boleyn girl), but with a magnificent production design, european landscapes and those thick british accents which make the movies to suggest artistic value which they do not really have.fortunately, the excellent film the young victoria does not fall on that situation, and it deserves an enthusiastic recommendation because of its fascinating story, the excellent performances from emily blunt, paul bettany and jim broadbent, and the costumes and locations which unexpectedly make the movie pretty rich to the view.and i say ""unexpectedly"" because i usually do not pay too much attention to those details.  ""victorian era"" was (in my humble opinion) one of the key points in contemporary civilization, and not only on the social aspect, but also in the scientific, artistic and cultural ones.but i honestly did not know about the origins from that era very much, and maybe because of that i enjoyed this simplification of the political and economic events which prepared the landing of modern era so much.i also liked the way in which queen victoria is portrayed, which is as a young and intelligent monarch whose decisions were not always good, but they were at least inspired by good intentions.i also found the depiction of the romance between victoria and prince albert very interesting because it is equally interested in the combination of intellects as well as in the emotions it evokes.the only fail i found on this movie is that screenwriter julian fellowes used some clichés of the romantic cinema on the love story, something which feels a bit out of place on his screenplay.  i liked the young victoria very much, and i really took a very nice surprise with it.i hope more period films follow the example of this movie: the costumes and the landscapes should work as the support of an interesting story, and not as the replacement of it.",1

"disappearance is about a couple who take their family on vacation in new mexico and find themselves in deep trouble after taking a detour off the main highway to visit a town that was seemingly abandoned in 1948 for unknown reasons. the town of weaver seems harmless at first and has tourist appeal until the family is stranded there overnight and they begin to have good reason to suspect that others have experienced their same predicament with fatal outcomes. the henleys watch a blair-witch-project-esquire video diary left by the town's last victim, which ironically demonstrates the best performance of anyone in this movie. although hamlin and dey's performances are much better than the supporting casts', their emotional affect seems ""flat"" to me throughout the movie.   disappearance has appeal for most of the movie as there is much suspense and good direction. however, the plot takes unexpected and implausible turns that seemingly make no sense. worse yet it that there really is no understanding of what exactly is going on in the movie, which makes the bizarre ending less tolerable. it appeared to me that the movie makers were so focused on making a stream of suspenseful scenes, that they threw away all the elements of good story making: plot development, gradual explanation of themes and symbols that lead to a cohesive solution/outcome.   the most difficult aspect of the movie for me was that the first three-quarter of it was spent building up tension and curiosity about certain aspects of the plot that were then suddenly disposed of as if we didn't deserve an explanation:   what was the significance of the indian symbols on the walls? what happened to the original people of weaver? what was the connection with the people at the dinner? what did the sheriff know? what did the missing boy discover if anything?  this was, i believe, a bad move, since it engendered some resentment. i had invested quite a bit of brainpower into hypothesizing some plausible explanations for some of these plot turns and strange events, only to have the movie makers simply end it without giving an answer to any of these things. these are some nice cliffhangers for the ending of a miniseries that is about to pickup again next week, but a totally frustrating and inappropriate ending for a stand-alone movie.",0
"if you want to make a movie like this, have the threat be real. don't surround your patsy with a bunch of bonzos. there is no credibility here. the plot is dull and unbelievable. the acting is even worse. i thought that i was watching arthur lake (dagwood) who is one of the worst actors in history, when i saw the main character. oh well, at some point he has to face the music and get fighting mad. i don't care. do you? there are all these long scenes set in this austere office (the furniture made out of cardboard or masonite). people talk and smoke and don't do anything. most of the action happens in a five minute sequence. after that, it's over. don't bother.",0
"i couldn't agree more with nomad 7's and i a hvr's comments. a perfect laid back sunday morning movie. the humor is subtle (exact opposite of ""slapstick"" as one misguided commenter noted).  but what always ceases to amaze me is how often i find myself wanting to come back to this movie over and over. i originally copied this movie onto vhs about 12 years ago when it was premiered on one of those pay cable free weekend previews(hbo maybe?). had never heard of it previously. don't know why it wasn't marketed that well. ?? when dvd's were released en mass, it was one of the first movies i replaced. a great combination of cast and writing. plus, the back drop of montana wilderness doesn't hurt things either (beautiful).  it's probably not the type of comedy for everyone, but what is? if adam sandler type stuff is up your alley, this probably won't be your cup of tea. this movie needs your full attention. the humor is mostly in the dialog.  i believe my next viewing will probably be about my 12th. but i still know that when it gets to the scenes like the one where the hoods of the police cars start blowing off, i'm going to loose it (ed o'neill's face is priceless!). recommended 110%.",1
"what we've got here is a situation. a man is found to be in distress and people want to help him -- in contrasting ways. at the end they are forced to let it go. you can't fix people. and though in various aspects reign over me is conventionally hollywood, that message isn't.  this story is not about charlie fineman (adam sandler), a man who lost his wife and three daughters in a 9/11 plane who's gone into a nearly psychotic state of ptss since. it's about what meeting charlie does to alan johnson (don cheadle), a dentist in new york who was his roommate in dental school and, knowing about his tragedy, spots him on the street and reconnects. charlie is riding around on a little toy motorized scooter -- a pretty fanciful contraption for negotiating manhattan traffic -- with big headphones on over a mass of unruly hair. the hair is sandler's chief prop to show he's deranged. and the use of music as an escape must hit home to every ipod-wielding subway rider.  charlie is a disaster, but paradoxically alan, stuck with a controlling wife (jada pinkett smith), soon begins to envy him. charlie is living like an nutty adolescent boy with a huge trust fund (insurance money from the tragedy), and starts dragging alan off to ""hang out,"" ""eat chinese,"" buy records, or watch a mel brooks marathon at a rep house. charlie lives in a nice big apartment protected by a mean landlady, redoing the kitchen over and over, collecting old vinyl of springsteen, the who, etc., and playing a video game called shadow of the collosus on a giant screen in a big empty living room.  charlie's in-laws are deeply concerned about him, but also somehow resentful, as we learn later. alan has a new patient who is propositioning him. charlie's desperation makes us see alan's. trying to help charlie partly permits alan to escape from his own stifling realities but partly just makes him more acutely aware of them.  cheadle and sandler make an odd couple, but that doesn't matter, because it's convincing that they might both need each other. charlie is desperate for the companionship of a friend who never knew his family, because to escape his loss, he is pretending he never had one. and so what if as a roommate charlie slept naked and sleep walked and had terrible musical taste (no motown)? alan wants an escape from his tidy, emasculating life. he's under the thumb not just of his wife but of his dental partners, who lord it over him though it's he who set up the practice. they're white, by the way, and he's black.  there's also the lascivious patient from hell, who seriously disrupts things at the dental offices, but starts looking different when charlie comes by and notices she's a babe. his libido seems to be lurking ready to revive at any minute. he's also drawn to the breasts of liv tyler, a psychotherapist in the same building as the dentists who starts trying to treat charlie when he admits he might need help.  sandler's mad scenes are a little too theatrical, as are a lot of the plot devices (in fact this movie feels like a play at more than one point), but he has several monologues where he expresses his sorrow in ways that are deeply touching.  charlie's not just delusional and sad, but dangerous and violent, and all these efforts to help him start to backfire. the movie is admirable in the way it conveys a sense that people can't be made right. this is an interesting movie -- sometimes a touching one -- and it's the first time 9/11 has been dealt with in terms of survivor suffering. but there is an element of comedy that seems tasteless at times, many of the people are too broadly drawn, and the overly grand hollywood interiors have dreadful décor; only the manhattan streets look real. there's a courtroom scene that is preposterous, and donald sutherland is a judge who's too good to be true. alan's family problem is resolved too easily with a phone call. and yet this is worth watching for the acting -- the control and subtlety of cheadle, and sandler in a serious role almost as good as the one he had in p.t. anderson's 2002 punch-drunk love, though that's clearly a better movie, in fact a much better one.",1

"wow! why would anybody make a sequel to an already rancid film? half past dead was a bad movie but at least at had an idea of what it wanted to be. hpd2 has no clue of what it wants to be. it just exists on screen for reasons i cant explain. spoiler: the whole movie is this: twitch(played by kurupt of tha dogg pound) gets transferred to another jail where there might be a box filled with gold bricks buried. in the jail, a riot breaks out between rival inmates, one of them gets shot by a guy named cortez and cortez plans his escape. during a conjugal visit, twitch's fiancée and burke's(played by bill goldberg)daughter get kidnapped by cortez and are held in an execution room. burke reluctantly befriends twitch and they end up getting into trouble with the idiotic inmates while finding out that cortez has their loved ones.  opinion: this is the most unnecessary sequel since universal soldier: the return. the script is terrible, the acting is horrendous, the dialog is a joke and everybody in this movie is a caricature. look, i know it was low budget film but that is not an excuse for these guys to not put effort into what they do. nobody in this ""movie"" believes in the characters they play. nobody in this ""movie can be taken seriously as an actor. kurupt should be ashamed of himself. his character ""twitch"" is pretty much a spineless minstrel puppet who spends most of his time posing while getting jacked up by burke or the other inmates. bill goldberg spends most of his time sulking throughout the movie as if he had to take a phd(pretty huge dump). the fight scenes are poorly choreographed and pathetic and for an action movie hpd2 is pretty boring even when action is happening! don't let anybody tell you that this movie is somewhat decent. it stinks and is a prime reason why people despise follywood.",0

"""midnight cowboy"" was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic. you know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song, 'everybody's talking' starts up on the soundtrack, (actually not written for the film), and the way the camera introduces us to joe buck, (naked and in the shower). we had seen jon voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him? this was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if voight had never done anything else, his performance here would still be legendary. as it is voight has seldom disappointed on screen; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish ""anaconda"" is a source of pleasure).  the film became famous and infamous almost overnight. it was a crowd-pleaser, (even with its downbeat ending), funny and sexy and recognizably 'real'; (it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true). it was also the first 'x' rated film to win the oscar as the year's best picture. adapted, (brilliantly), by waldo salt from a james leo herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial american movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner. everyone is recognizably human, warts and all, and everyone is treated sympathetically. voight's joe buck is an innocent abroad, a candide who comes to new york to seek his fortune as a hustler, (a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy; he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker). but when he himself is hustled by a scraggy, wormy little con-man called 'ratso' rizzo, (dustin hoffman, fresh from ""the graduate"" and he's a revelation), he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream.  essentially it's a male love story, (though totally platonic), between these two not so unlikely bedfellows. both totally alone, both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other, (voight with his physical prowess, hoffman with his street-wise savvy). they are misfits adrift from the mainstream, tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others. though 'straight' voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself. (the whole film posits a strangely 'christian' attitude).  it's also magnificently acted. while voight and hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of brenda vaccaro and sylvia miles as well as john mcgiver, bob balaban and bernard hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on, beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while john schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye-view of the american under-belly without rancor and without criticism. on second thoughts, maybe it is a great movie after all.",1

"while i have a great respect for disney's animated films, as of late they haven't really been what i would call ""must-see"". atlantis looked intriguing from the first movie poster and trailer, and thankfully lived up to my expectations.  atlantis is a more ""mature"" disney film in the sense that it lacks songs (a very unusual trait for a disney film indeed), and is focused more on action and discovery than any other recent disney offering. the world of atlantis, hidden beneath the earth's core, is fantastic, presented as desolate caverns with ruins, and then slowly developing into actual ecosystems, which, while usually containing some reminder of harshness, become more and more intriguing until the tropical paradise itself is reached. the presentation of simply atlantis' landscape and setting, without some expendable cheery song, gave the kingdom a much more beautiful and intriguing appearance. the inclusion of an atlantean language, as well as attempts to connect it into the mythology of real-life ancient civilizations adds to this, and works fairly well.  also, with the exception of some scenes involving mole's practical jokes, there didn't seem to be much of a ""childish"" element that i usually associate with disney films. instead, the main elements were the struggle to get to atlantis, and the constant discovery that occurred at atlantis, as milo the outsider was able to learn all he ever needed to know about the place by helping the atlanteans discover parts of their own history that they didn't know about. part of this involves the atlantean ""weaponry"", which is used in a very action-packed climax which is, for lack of a better word, quite exciting.  granted, not all of the story makes full sense, and the film doesn't feature any amazing new computer-generated visual effects, but, aside from the toy story movies, this is the most entertaining disney film i've seen in years.",1

"it's not often i feel compelled to give negative criticism of a film; after all i often feel the maxim, ""if you don't have anything good to say don't say it at all,"" would be apt advice for the many naysayers we listen to everyday who nitpick at things we like. if it's all the same to you the reader though i feel compelled to point out that with the lone exception of christopher walken in a returning role as gabriel this movie is pathetically horrid. i say this to you to warn you in advance that even if you are a fan of walken's deadpan delivery and style or liked the original ""prophecy"" that you will be sorely dissapointed. if you buy it, return it. if you rent it, make sure it's only ninety-nine cents.  what's wrong with this movie? a full list would take too long to read and would bore you to tears, but a short summary would be the following: the once rather crystalline clear picture of the relationship between angels and mortals of the first film is ripped to shreds. gabriel is turned from the rather morbid right hand of god he once was (and in this role he is wickedly funny in the first) to little more than a thug for heaven. since walken is so good at playing heavies (we all remember frank white from ""king of new york"") he is still enjoyable but the supporting cast is an unmitigated and unconvincing mess of mortals and angels alike who couldn't buy a clue for 50 cents. if you can figure out the plot you're a smarter man than i. one gets the feeling we wander aimlessly from scene to scene just to move the film along to walken's next big line. by the end of the movie you're actually wishing he'd blow his horn and make the walls of jericho fall on the people who made this un-natural disaster.  bottom line - it's an insult to our intelligence that they made a sequel to this film in the first place. the original told the right story, answered the questions that should have been, and left alone the ones you were meant to ponder afterwards. there are no compelling reasons to follow these characters that was in the first - the priest who lost his faith, the little girl who kept the ""big secret"", the teacher who protected her children - even lucifer himself was more interesting by himself in the first film than all the other characters in the sequel put together. i feel sorry for anybody who sees this film and not the first because they'll probably never want to watch the original and that's a real tragedy.",0

"i found this movie to be a great idea, that didn't deliver. it seems they found a way to build suspense, but couldn't stage their payoffs very well. in one case the police, are on the clock to find the hideout of the kidnappers. they painstakingly go from dentist to dentist to match a dental record. at the same time, the kidnapped man (mason) escapes through the elevator shaft. after all the build up, the police arrive at the same time he gets free, which is very anti-climatic to say the least. there are also large narration scenes that take us ""inside the thinking"" of the terrorized husband and wife, which detracts from the suspense rather than adds to it. we are fully aware of their tension, and the voice-over is an insult and robs the viewer of any chance of a personal experience with the fear, as hitchcock proved time and again, is far more effective. the greatest disappointment, is to sit through the whole movie, and the get the quick, rather bland ending. i mean it just...""ends"" in a snore.",0

every now and then a film maker brings to life a unique group of people and lets you inside to see the things that make us human. lawrence kasden done this again. i always felt thebg cill was the anthem of it's age and he has managed to do it again in grand canyon. every so often we find ourselves at a point where we have the opportunity to choose life and so often we blow it. this is a film about people who find the courage to choose and experience life because of that choice. the juxtaposing of little and big events that lets us see how basically trivial most things we worry about are is truly genius. i have watched this film a number of times and am constanly surprised at how deep the emotions run through this film. danny glover and kevin kline do their roles with great tenderness and stever martins portrayal of a movie exec is priceless. thank you again mr. kasden,1
"election is a chinese mob movie, or triads in this case. every two years an election is held to decide on a new leader, and at first it seems a toss up between big d (tony leung ka fai, or as i know him, ""the other tony leung"") and lok (simon yam, who was judge in full contact!). though once lok wins, big d refuses to accept the choice and goes to whatever lengths he can to secure recognition as the new leader. unlike any other asian film i watch featuring gangsters, this one is not an action movie. it has its bloody moments, when necessary, as in goodfellas, but it's basically just a really effective drama. there are a lot of characters, which is really hard to keep track of, but i think that plays into the craziness of it all a bit. a 100-year-old baton, which is the symbol of power i mentioned before, changes hands several times before things settle down. and though it may appear that the film ends at the 65 or 70-minute mark, there are still a couple big surprises waiting. simon yam was my favorite character here and sort of anchors the picture.  election was quite the award winner at last year's hong kong film awards, winning for best actor (tony leung), best picture, best director (johnny to, who did heroic trio!!), and best screenplay. it also had nominations for cinematography, editing, film score (which i loved), and three more acting performances (including yam).",1
"deanna durbin, nan grey and barbara read are ""three smart girls"" in this universal film from 1936, which introduces deanna durbin to film audiences. it also stars ray milland, mischa auer, charles winninger, john king, binnie barnes and alice brady. it's a sweet story about three young women, now living in switzerland with their divorced mother, who hear their father (winninger) is marrying again. not having seen him in 10 years and knowing their mother still loves him, they board a ship to america, with the help of the housekeeper/nanny, determined to stop the wedding. realizing that the intended, called ""precious"" (barnes) is nothing but a gold-digger aided and abetted by her mother (brady), they arrange for her to be introduced to a wealthy count. this is arranged by their father's accountant (king). the man he chooses is a full-time drunk (auer), but the girls mistake him for an actual wealthy count (milland). what a mess.  this is a delightful film, not cloying or overly sugary at all, with some nice performances, particularly by auer, milland, barnes and brady. the young women are pretty and all do good work. the emphasis, of course, is on young durbin, who is a natural actress and a beautifully-trained singer. in fact, her voice as a youngster is much more even than it would be as an adult - she has no trouble with the high notes, as she did later on because she put too much weight in the middle voice. she sings a delightful ""il bacio"" in a police station.  one of the nicest things about the film is to see the father, played by charles winninger, not want his children around - until he sees them and gets to know them. barnes as the gold-digger isn't all that young, but the girls' mother looks way up there, so the inference probably was the older man seeking his youth with a younger, more glamorous woman. in fact, he finds the youth he was seeking in his daughters.  universal gives durbin the big star buildup here - she has the final shot in the movie. ray milland at this point was still paying his dues, and it will probably be a surprise even to film fans how young and attractive he is.  very entertaining and of course, this led to a sequel and big stardom for deanna.",1
"i am currently doing film studies at a.s level and ""this is not a love song"" is a film we watched and in my opinion it is a film with a very simple storyline but a complex back-story. if you scratch the surface you will find a thriller-chase film of two men running through the countryside from farmers, after committing a murder:-""sounds quite exiting"".  however you need to dig deeper to uncover the true feeling of the true genre. as it is suggested, it is a love story between two homosexual lovers, filled with trust, deceit and betrayal. we are not told about this ""love"" directly through the film but the events that happen through out, for example the way heaton acts towards spike almost screams this untouched love affair in our faces.  overall this film is a good example of why british films should not be dismissed as ""rubbish"" just because they are done on a low budget.  a good film with an intricate story line, however it is definitely an acquired taste and is possibly not suitable for the average fan of hollywood blockbusters.",1

"rarely have i witnessed such a gratuitous waste of talent. there is almost nothing constructive to be said about this hopeless swamp of a film. what few interesting strands the film seems to promise initially turn out to be little more than red herrings. actors of stature - robert duvall, robert downey, jr. - are deployed in roles which go nowhere; a director of occasional genius produces a film which looks like it is filmed through a coffee-stained camera lens; a writer (john grisham) who has never produced anything of merit, discovers new depths of under-motivated incoherence. the film has a cheap, lecherous feel about it - but barely at the level of commentary - its really part of the aesthetic. normally, i come on to the imdb to write balanced, generally appreciative comments. this egregious disaster of a film just makes me want to produce an endless, bilious rant. i won't, but only because i no longer want to occupy my ""mind"" with this trash.",0
"how, in the name of all that's holy, did this film ever get distribution? it looks as if it has been shot on someone's mobile phone and takes the screaming girl victim scenario to whole new depths. they literally scream for the full 90 minutes of the movie. and that's all they do. there is no plot, no tension, no characters, and not a lot of acting. just screaming and more screaming.  i gave up after fifteen minutes and fast-wound through it to see if anything happened. it doesn't - except for screaming, of course. odlly enough, the act of going through it on fast forward highlights another problem - there is no camera-work to speak of. every shot looks like every other shot - middle distance, one angle, dull, dull, dull.  it's not so bad it's good. it's just plain bad.",0
"the movie is about anton newcombe. the music and careers of the two bands are simply backdrop. it's only fair that newcombe have the last word about the film, which at this writing you can find in the ""news"" section at the brianjonestownmassacre website. i'd link it here but imdb won't permit it.  documentarians are limited by what the camera captures, as well as by the need to assemble a cohesive narrative from the somewhat-random occasions when chance has put the camera lens on a sight-line with relevant happenstance. in dig!, fortune smiled on the dandy warhols, capturing their rise to the status of pop-idol candidates, as they formed slickly-produced pop confections for mass consumption, most notably ""bohemian like you,"" a song that made them global darlings thanks to a euro cell phone ad.   no such luck for brian jonestown massacre. the film captures little of what made the original bjm lineup great, with the sole exception of a single montage, lasting a minute or so, showing newcombe creating/recording a number of brief instrumental parts, unremarkable in themselves, and concluding the sequence with a playback of the lush, shimmering sounds that had to have been in newcombe's mind and soul before they could enter the world.  three commentaries accompany the film; one by the filmmakers, and two by the members of the bands (the bjm track is solely former members, and without newcombe). both the warhols and bjm alumni point up this montage sequence as the ""best"" bit in the film, and i'd agree that, given the film's focus on anton newcombe, it is the only part of the film that sheds proper light on his gift, and seems too brief to lend proper balance to this attempted portrait of the ""tortured artist.""  interesting thing about commentaries is that, unlike film, they are recorded in real time -- one long take -- which can be more honestly revelatory than a documentary that takes shape primarily through editing.  the dandies do not come off well in their comments. if the rock and roll world extends the experience of high school life for its denizens -- as i believe it does -- the dandies are the popularity-obsessed preppy types, the ones who listen to rock because it's what their peers do, while the bjm crew come off as the half-rejected, half-self-exiled outsiders (to insiders like the dandies, ""losers"") that are the real rock spirit. bjm's joel gion, who talks a lot, nails the film's message for me when he says (paraphrasing): ""you can't forget that anton has been able to do the only thing he ever said he wanted to do. make a lot of great music.""  the dandies, meanwhile, laugh too easily at every outrageous display in the course of newcombe's meltdown (all the bjm footage here ends at 1997, before newcombe quit heroin). courtney taylor-taylor's discounting of newcombe's commitment to his vision is summed up as follows: ""he's 37 and still living in his car. you can download all his work at his website. he was so tired of being ripped off by everyone else, he's giving it all away. he could be making a mint."" you can practically hear him shaking his head in disbelief.  the film's shortcomings can't be blamed on the filmmakers; rather it's the difficulties of the documentary form, and the loss of cooperation by the film's subject, that makes this portrait of newcombe so fragmentary. but it's likely the best we will get, outside of his music.  i only rented disc one, which has the feature. most of the extras are on disc two. not renting that, as i've put in my order to buy the set.",1
"penny princess finds american working girl yolande donlon the inheritor of a small kingdom that lies in that triangle where france, italy, and switzerland meet called lampidorra. it seems as though the lampidorrans owe bills all over europe and the main occupation of the country is smuggling due to its geography. an american multi-millionaire buys the place, but dies before he can take title. his nearest heir is donlan.  but of course the estate has to go through probate in america and what are the lampidorrans to do? especially since donlan who has now become a princess has forbade smuggling.  enter dirk bogarde who is on a trip to switzerland to learn about the cheese industry. it seems as though the lampidorrans have a kind of cheese that they playfully refer to as schmeeze. with a few bumps in the road, schmeeze solves all the problems both financial, geopolitical, and romantic between donlan and bogarde.  how does schmeeze work, well that's the gimmick to the whole film. but here's a hint. in lover come back jack kruschen might just have gotten a hold of the secret of schmeeze when he was busy inventing vip for rock hudson and his advertising agency.  anyway penny princess is a delightful blend of british farce and romantic comedy. yolande donlon once again plays a role that marilyn monroe would have been cast in if the film had been made this side of the pond. dirk bogarde was well cast in the part which was at the beginning of his career as a romantic heart throb, way before anyone but him suspected he had the acting chops he had.  this film was sadly shown at three o'clock in the morning on tcm. but at least i found a reason to be grateful for insomnia.",1
"this film definitely gets a thumbs up from me. it's witty jokes and even it's occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on eastern european people had me in stitches throughout most of the film. it's plot is clever and 100% original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film. the one person i was most impressed with in this film was hilary duff. it's plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the 'chick-flick' genre she's used to. her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and well-executed. it is the best performance i have ever seen from hilary, and i have seen most of her films. her character, yonica babyyeah is described as 'the britney spears of eastern europe' and this is seen in some of her mannerisms and the song, 'i want to blow you... ... ... up'. you also feel sorry for her, as her performance really grasps you, yonica is a very complex and confused character. joan cusack had me laughing throughout the whole film with her sometimes slapstick humour, but also her facial expressions and so on. john cusack's witty dialogue will probably make you chuckle throughout. i strongly recommend this film.",1

"legend of zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years. it transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art. with unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions, legend of zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty. this movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life. the acting is perfect for this type of movie; if you were an immortal with supernatural powers i would think you'd keep more to yourself.  unlike the comments of many, the plot is actually quite easy to follow while maintaining a quick pace that adds a sense of urgency. anyone that cannot keep track of the different characters simply must not be paying attention since or are used to such levels of sophistication as the titanic. the plot is engaging and layered with themes so epic that they will leave you gasping for air. legend of zu is on a level of greatness so high that perhaps many people are put off by its grandeur. allow yourself to be completely engulfed within its fantastical vision and you will grow to love this movie.",1

"i managed to catch a late night double feature last night of ""before sunrise"" (1995) and ""before sunset"" (2004), and saw both films in a row, without really having the chance to catch my breath in between or ponder on the meaning of each film separately. after sleeping it over, i have to say that i largely prefer the former over the latter, and i shall explain why.  before sunrise introduces us with then young actors, ethan hawke (reality bites, dead poets society), only 25 at the time of the film's release; and julie delpy (the three colors trilogy), then 26 (although looking much younger). he is a promiscuous american writer, touring europe after breaking up with his girlfriend; she is a young french student, on her way home to paris. they meet on the budapest-vienna train and spontaneously decide to get off the train together. the two deeply spiritual and intellectual individuals than spend a whole night together walking the beautifully captured streets of vienna, exchanging ideals and thoughts and gradually falling on love.  the film has 1990's written all over it: back then, technology was leaping rapidly, the new millennium with all it's hopes and dreams was waiting just around the corner, and young adults like the ones depicted in the film were filled with love of life and passion for the future. the characters of jesse (hawke) and celine (delpy), with all their flaws and inconsistencies (celine's accent, if by mistake or on purpose, was half american-half french, and it swinged from one spectrum to the other, breaking the character's credibility), were a mirror of the time. watching the naive couple swallow life with such meaning and excitement, acting all clichéd and romantic yet managing to have the audience fall for them as well, is what really made this movie work for me. the fact that the director doesn't let you know if their relationship continues after the film or not makes it all even more worth while.  all in all, sunrise is a dreamy stroll through the urban landscapes of vienna, a well told classical romantic rendezvous, and a film i will definitely return to for further insight sometime in the future.",1
"i saw this 25 years ago on pbs. it was very difficult to watch. so real. to watch this small family struggle in the winter was heart rending. no time for courting: fate has thrown us together and we put our shoulders to the grindstone and make it work. this was based on the woman's actual diary, which i read many years later. she said in her diary that her parents died when she was little and all their bothers and sisters had to work the farm to feed themselves. she learned to mow, which was not lady-like. she was afraid that no prince charming would want a woman with sun-browned, calloused hands, but this husband was so happy that his new wife knew how to mow, and she was happy to do it. both were widowed and together they worked to build a new home. it was so, so sad when the baby died. of course, if they had it today, i am sure it would have been fine. that only makes the tragedy extra sad. i was crying so hard. but then they went out and successfully pulled out a new calf. spring is on its way, and life goes on. in her diary, she did have two more boys and they lived.",1

"this movie is about a female rape victim/comic book writer from new york that decides to get away from all that awful big city glamor and move to a dirty, run down small town where she finds refuge in a single-wide trailer on a dirt lot in the middle of 12th and nowhere. the townspeople are mentally ill, yet so is she for inviting crazy men into her trailer. annoying is the fact that she has the ability to do exactly the right thing to place herself in dangerous circumstance after dangerous circumstance. db sweeney's performance was high school at best. he's one of those kinda-cute young actors with a sweet grin. unfortunately career has not been kind and mother nature has been right in tow. to the previous commentator stating that the acting was ""so real"", well i agree. actually it wasn't acting. the two main characters really are pathetic, weak and incapable of making mature, healthy decisions. in brief, this movie sucks like no other, rent it to laugh at it. the real crime scene? the atrocious wood paneling in the trailer - enough to make me commit murder. and lastly, she's a artist/writer, so couldn't she afford a double-wide trailer and something other than a sun-yellow chevy chevette for love of god!",0
"the minion is about... well, a minion. a servant of satan and whose goal is to get the key that will unlock the door where his master is trapped. he is some sort of demon who possess human beings and when the body dies will possess another. anyone who happens to be possessed will go on some berserker rage. dolph lundgren plays lukas, a member of a secret order of templars, who is tasked to keep the key away from the minion. the movie begins a thousand years ago, in the middle east where a couple of knight templars flee from the minion. then flash forward to 1999, where the key winds up somewhere underground in new york. an archeologist is assigned to study/dig the place where the key was found. needless to say, the minion is after the key, and the movie becomes a long winded chase scene between the minion and lukas and archeologist.  the movie, is just that, a low budget b-movie flick. the movie lacks energy, and just trods along. you'll follow the chase but you won't ever feel involved in the story which willfully takes ideas from previous movies (especially the terminator films). the fight scenes with the minion is troublesome, in that you never get the sense of how good or how bad a warrior this demon is. it ""skillfully"" becomes a one-man army when fighting a squad of templars but sucks when it comes to one-on one. and it's supposed to be around for a long time. all this goes to show that any sense of logic is just thrown down the drain for convenience. the whole idea of a secret order of templars, a door to hell, and the key isn't well explained. we are merely to accept that they just exist. the movie seems to have been made with the feeling there's not much potential to the story but only enough to make a few bucks. dolph lundgren sure looks like he wish he were somewhere else.  the verdict: 2 of 5 stars.",0
"to make up a movie-going audience - i'm certainly stunned by the number of positive comments this wretched film has garnered here. i can't credit it, can't help but be suspicious, for that matter, of back alley payoffs to critics who are touting annette bening for an oscar; the hole in the kitchen ceiling might be more appropriately attributed to her scenery chewing. she's a wonderful actress but this is an unfortunately unbalanced performance, lacking that essential quality film actors must master of catching the cadence of the screenplay and maintaining it for the duration of the disjointed madness that is a film shoot.  i don't really want to blame miss bening or most of the other performers (well, gwyneth paltrow has no excuse for her muzzy work), however, because this is a horrendous adaptation, a classic case of mistranslation (i am prepared to assume. i haven't read the book and don't think i will after this). the script launches us into the middle/muddle of unaccountable behaviour and extreme emotional angst spewing from mystifying characters who have developed relationships neither with us nor each other. it quickly becomes a grotesquely excessive tsunami-like assault that sullies characters and audience alike and left me like a survivor shaking my head at the detritus left at the end of each repetitive episode. shock and awe would describe my reaction to frantic, bi-polar mood swings between ranting and oh-so-quiet sensitivity, the latter telegraphed by one of the most irritating, manipulative, droning soundtracks i've heard - that is, when all this isn't being set to ludicrously incongruous toons - period stuff, ya know, but chosen with an astounding disregard for the tone of the scenes.  how this fine cast got mixed up in this i don't know - i can't believe they saw the screenplay before signing. they certainly apply their skills with commitment - i felt so sorry for the wonderful jill clayburgh saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and wig trying vainly to wrench something of significance from sketchy and clichéd dialogue. in contrast, somehow, alec baldwin rises above the material to deliver a consistent, nuanced, real performance. can somebody give this man a lead role of substance, please? and how about rachel evan wood - or joseph fiennes? you'd think the industry could make better use of him, and without appearing as hirsute as elliot gould in m.a.s.h.   my vote? a standup turd, all right, but no link with heaven.",0

"first things first: i'm not a conservative. and even though i would never refer to myself as a liberal or a democrat, i was opposed to the war in iraq from day one. i think it's safe to say john cusack and i would probably see eye-to-eye on politics, in fact, i'm sure we'd become drinking buddies if we ever got to talking about how great adam curtis' bbc docs are. my point is this: don't discredit this review by thinking i'm not a part of the choir cusack is preaching to in war, inc. there's no question wi's politics are tailored to appeal to my demographic, but the problem is, the tailoring is substandard and the the film cusack co- wrote, produced and stars in, fits worse than a cheap suit.  as they say ""the road to hell is paved with good intentions."" cusack, his co-writers, director joshua seftel and even the actors involved, no doubt had every intention of making an anti- war film every bit as biting and funny as robert altman's m*a*s*h, unfortunately for the viewer, they ended up with one as unfunny and unintelligent as michael moore's canadian bacon.  the current state of us politics, foreign policy and the war ""effort"" is already absurd and, as a result, tragic, pathetic and, regrettably comical -- just watch the daily show and see for yourself. the bottom line is: you can't write material as funny as what the bush administration provides us on a daily basis, so why try to compete?  the main problem with wi is that it feels it was put together in a hurry. to get it done, cusack basically cannibalized grosse pointe blank (one of his best films), changed the setting and crammed in a shopping list of ideas lifted from the collected works of naomi klein. most of these ideas are rammed down your throat in the first twenty minutes of the film and what makes them so obnoxious is none of the jokes or gags or deliberately obvious references to halliburton, the neo-cons and the us occupation of iraq, are imaginative, clever or funny. the writers are so blinded by their own dogma they felt that by simply referencing these issues the film would be funny and subversive. the trouble is...it isn't. by now these ideas are yesterday's news and unless you've been living under or rock or are so blinded by ignorance, denial and sheer stupidity (read: a right-wing christian), these jokes insultingly simple.  perhaps wi would work if it was more nuanced, subversive, offensive and fattened up with detailed research/insights into the occupation. as it is, the jokes and sight gags are all surface and are so bad, with so little finesse, subtlety or satirical wickedness, they did little more than make me groan. homer simpson once said ""it's funny 'cause it's true"" and the daily show proves this every night; war, inc. however proves that just because it's true doesn't make it funny. the bottom line: hyperbole isn't required when it comes to lampooning us/neo-conservative politics...it's already a big enough joke.  http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/",0

"ok... this movie so far has been slated by critics and board-posters alike (although playing devil's advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didn't make it for themselves as film-makers, and board posters are often people who didn't make it for themselves as critics) so i wanted to sit in guy's corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people who've decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at it.  the film's biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is. this has been described many times as as making the film ""inaccessible"" to the viewer. the film's chronology is relatively non-linear and the characters are used as not only a means of storytelling but as a device for showing us the subtle (or not so subtle) hints of bias we give things as we commit them to memory, ie. ray liotta's character brandishing a gun saying the words ""fear me"" is portrayed as both tragically pathetic (from statham's pov) or interrogating and bold (from liotta's pov). this is but one example of ritchie's far more mature approach he has taken to film-making with revolver, we have a storyline which is pretty archetypal (the strong but silent gritty anti-hero gets released from jail with a score to settle but gets drawn inadvertently into a world of corruption... i mean it's paint by numbers film noir here guys, all the way down to the vague poetic choice of diction and the gritty voice-overs) but then guy has taken this framework to make a number of extremely philosophical and complex points.  take the scene where jason statham's character runs afoul of a car. this throwaway sequence could have been emitted from the film and made no difference to the story whatsoever... but ritchie is making point about how such little chance happenings such as receiving a phone call can make the difference between life and death.  so the final act of the movie is pretty mind boggling, i'd be taking the p*ss if i said i didn't spend the last 20 minutes or so of the film turning to my date going ""uh... wtf?""... but that is the shoddiest reason to disregard a piece of art. it is far too easy to dislike something because you find it hard to understand. and even easier to say ""well nobody else seemed to understand it so it must be a real turd of a film!"". in my humble opinion, revolver is a stylish, complex and mature piece of modern art which should be greeted with the same manner we would give the work of the saatchi brothers. if we choose this opportunity to collectively say ""ah sh*t, i wanted a film about a load of bleeding' cockney gangsters in-nit loll... guy ritchie is a tit!"" then the day will come when film-makers are allowed only to make that which is expected of them by shallow, crappy people. just because guy made a name for himself with funny, cheeky cockney romps, doesn't mean he can't be deep without being ""pretentious"". funny people can be thoughtful too.",1
"i loved ""the curse of frankenstein"" so much that i rushed out to get ""frankenstein must be destroyed"" to see cushing at it again...even if it was without chistopher lee this time. to my great disappointment, this movie not only does without lee, but it does without frankenstein's monster altogether! was it a case of ""if we can't get lee, we won't have a monster at all""? why would they do that? the monster is half the fun of the whole thing!! this film is dedicated solely to the study of baron frankenstein and his quest to finish experiments he had begun in brain transplants before ending up in an asylum. i found the script extremely weak, with the need to suspend disbelief forced upon the audience a little too much. i'm willing to suspend a fair amount, but this movie got fairly ridiculous, which took me out of the film rather than immersing me in it.  peter cushing, though, is absolutely brilliant playing pure evil in this film. for being one of the most beloved actors and notoriously sweet men, he sure could play menacing and malevolent extremely well. the supporting cast is competent, but has little to do, even the young doctor and his fiancée blackmailed into helping frankenstein. a bumbling police chief is introduced, along with his put-upon sidekick, to generate some comic relief, then they are completely dropped from the movie! why? we are led to believe that the police chief will be the main nemesis of the baron, then we are led to believe it will be the young doctor, and then it ends up being the victim of frankenstein's brain transplant experiment. there was no tension, we weren't invested in the ""creature"", and the ending was left so ambiguous as to leave one unsatisfied because it is so clear they are setting up another sequel.  also, there are virtually no ""horror"" elements. yes, there is a beheading in the beginning (off-camera), and we are treated to the sounds of cushing cutting the tops of two men's skulls off (again, off camera), and there is the most unsettling and thoroughly unnecessary rape scene (90% of which is, again, off-camera). i understand that there is a love of ""letting the audience imagine it all, for their imaginations are far worse than what we can show"", but come on, if you're not going to give us a monster, then at least let us see the few ""horrific"" elements you do choose to include. showing us a skeleton in the lab lit with a green light is just not scary.  on top of a weak script, i thought the directing was mostly flat. there were a couple of nice shots, but otherwise no excitement, atmosphere, or suspense was generated. the same director did ""curse"" back in 1958 and i thought it was brilliantly directed...guess he was as uninspired by this film as i was.  the movie gets a 4 out of 10 from me strictly for peter cushing's powerful, nuanced performance...beyond that, i found little in this movie worth recommending. instead, my suggestion is to watch ""the curse of frankenstein"" and see a truly great hammer horror film.",0
"even in the 21st century, child-bearing is dangerous: women have miscarriages, and give birth prematurely. seventy-five years ago, it was not uncommon for women to die during childbirth. that is the theme of ""life begins"": a look at the ""difficult cases"" ward of a maternity hospital. loretta young plays the lead, a woman brought here from prison (what crime she committed is not germane to the plot) to give birth; she's conflicted about the fact she's going to have to give her baby up after birth. she's in a ward with several other women, who share their joys and pain with each other.  although loretta young is the lead, the outstanding performance, as usual, is put in by glenda farrell. farrell was one of warner's ""b"" women in the 1930s, showing up quite a bit in supporting roles, and sometimes getting the lead in b movies (farrell played torchy blane in several installments of the ""torchy"" b-movie series.) here, farrell plays an expectant mother who doesn't want her children, since they'll only get in the way. she does everything she can to get in the way of the nurses, including smuggling liquor into the ward (this of course during the prohibition days), and drinking like a fish -- apparently they'd never heard of fetal alcohol syndrome back in the 30s.  interestingly, unlike most movie of the early 1930s, it's not the women being bumbling idiots getting in the way of the heroic men -- that situation is reversed, with the expectant fathers being quivering mounds of jelly. (watch for veteran character actor frank mchugh as one of the expectant fathers.) ""life begins"", being an early talkie, treats the subject with a fair dollop of melodrama, to be sure, but it's quite a charming little movie. turner classic show it, albeit infrequently; i've only seen it show up on a few days honoring loretta young. but it's highly recommended viewing when it does show up.",1
"this has to be one of the worst films i have ever seen without a doubt. the only thing interesting in this film is the cameo appearances from some great genre directors and king himself. the film has a great premise, but falls apart about 15 minutes into the story. i did like madchen amick in this film and think she could have a very good career in film.",0
"i honestly had no idea that the notorious b.i.g. (bert i. gordon the director; not the murdered rapper) was still active in the 80's! i always presumed the deliciously inept ""empire of the ants"" stood as his last masterful accomplishment in the horror genre, but that was before my dirty little hands stumbled upon an ancient and dusty vhs copy of ""the coming"", a totally obscure and unheard of witchery-movie that actually turned out a more or less pleasant surprise! what starts out as a seemingly atmospheric tale of late dark ages soon takes a silly turn when a villager of year 1692 inexplicably becomes transferred to present day salum, massachusetts and promptly attacks a girl in the history museum. for you see, this particular girl is the reincarnation of ann putman who was a bona fide evil girl in 1692 and falsely accused over twenty people of practicing witchcraft which led to their executions at the state. the man who attacked loreen lost his wife and daughter this and wants his overdue revenge. but poor and three centuries older loreen is just an innocent schoolgirl,  or is she? ""burned at the stake"" unfolds like a mixture between ""the exorcist"" and ""witchfinder general"" with a tad bit of ""the time machine"" thrown in for good measure. way to go, bert! the plot becomes sillier and more senseless with every new twist but at least it never transcends into complete boredom, like too often the case in other contemporary witchcraft movies like ""the dunwich horror"" and ""the devonsville terror"". the film jumps back and forth between the events in present day and flashbacks of 1692; which keeps it rather amusing and fast-paced. the ann putman girl is quite a fascinating character, reminiscent of the abigail williams character in the more commonly known stage play ""the crucible"" (also depicted by winona ryder in the 1996 motion picture). there are a couple of cool death sequences, like the teacher in the graveyard or the journalist in the library, that are committed by the ghost of malignant reverend who made a pact with ann putman and perhaps even the devil himself. the film gets pretty spastic and completely absurd near the end, but overall there's some good cheesy fun to be had. plus, the least you can say about bert i. gordon is that he definitely build up some directorial competences over the years.",0
"one of the more 'literate' lone stars, with time spent on character development and interaction, dialog and acting business. the opening scene sets the stage (literally) for the personalities of the gambler, kansas charlie (eddy chandler), and his buddy, john scott (john wayne) the rodeo (say roh-day-oh) star, both of whom are slightly randy. the film follows their adventures, as they try to best each other in the pursuit of the mexican juanita, and later in their pursuit of perky mary kornman, who has the inevitable evil brother (though he'd been led astray by the real villain, and wants to repent). and oh, of course, they're being wrongly accused of two crimes and have to serve jail time before escaping and being exonerated at the end.  the high point is scott continually and deliberately ogling mary's butt in her grocery store, and knocking away the ladder she's standing on so he can catch her and grab her as she falls. it all seems a little contemporary for a 30s western, but it sounds better than it actually is.   sadly, the exciting action elements we find in many other lone stars are sorely missing here. no yakima canutt. cheap and bad uses of stock footage of riders falling off horses. no george hayes. tedious stooge-like bi-play between scott and charlie, with charlie swinging at scott, scott stomping on his foot and then punching him (repeated two more times!). the skilled paul fix is underused. eddy chandler himself, here in his big star turn, is not really believable as a randy side kick. the villain looks too old and fat. so does chandler, who spent his later career in 300 more movies as an uncredited meatloaf. mary kornman, of the twenties ""our gang"" (see 'mary, queen of tots' 1925) is cute in her scenes with john wayne, but that's about it for this one. seeds of a better western lie buried here.  p.s. the ultra-short colorized version, which looks good, moves along so fast, it's over if you blink more than once. thankfully though, the embarrassing scenes with eddy chandler have been cut.",0
"this entertainingly tacky'n'trashy distaff ""death wish"" copy stars the exceptionally gorgeous and well-endowed brunette hottie supreme karin mani as billie clark, a top-notch martial arts fighter and one woman wrecking crew who opens up a gigantic ten gallon drum of ferocious chopsocky whup-a** on assorted no-count scuzzy muggers, rapists, drug dealers and street gang members after some nasty low-life criminals attack her beloved grand parents. the stunningly voluptuous ms. mani sinks her teeth into her feisty butt-stomping tough chick part with winningly spunky aplomb, beating jerky guys up with infectious glee and baring her smoking hot bod in a few utterly gratuitous, but much-appreciated nude scenes. unfortunately, mani possesses an extremely irritating chewing-on-marbles harsh and grating voice that's sheer murder on the ears (my favorite moment concerning mani's dubious delivery of her dialogue occurs when she quips ""don't mess with girls in the park; that's not nice!"" after clobbering a few detestable hooligans. the delectable karin's sole subsequent film role was in ""avenging angel,"" in which she does a truly eye-popping full-frontal nude scene, but doesn't have any lines.) the film's single most sensationally sleazy sequence transpires when mani gets briefly incarcerated on a contempt of court charge and shows her considerably substantial stuff in a group prison shower scene. of course, mani's lascivious lesbian cell mate tries to seduce her only to have her unwanted advances rebuffed with a severe beatdown! strangely enough, the lesbian forgives mani and becomes her best buddy while she's behind bars. given an extra galvanizing shot in the vigorously rough'n'ready arm by edward victor's punchy direction, a funky-rockin' score, endearingly crummy acting by a game (if lame) cast, a constant snappy pace, numerous pull-out-all-the-stops exciting fight scenes, and howard anderson iii's gritty photography, this immensely enjoyable down'n'dirty exploitation swill is essential viewing for hardcore fans of blithely low-grade low-budget grindhouse cinema junk.",1

"i would like to say that curiosity got the best of me. if only i saw a trailer, i'd be able to tell you the whole plot of the movie; i could have saved myself the most pointless one hour and forty minutes in my entire life, and about twenty dollars. this movie was a disaster waiting to happen, and it is an embarrassment to hollywood.  the movie displays a vivid ignorance of reality. for example, this kid's remote control race car goes all over the neighborhood, and even enters this house. it's even covered with clothes. is it not rational to believe that a remote can no longer transmit a signal under those circumstances? hollywood obviously did not believe so. common logic and any concept of electronics dictates the opposite; i doubt the race car could even have reached the street, let alone a house across the street. another unrealistic trait is the lack of intelligence the criminals possess. why is it in all these movies, these criminals are rocket scientists until they encounter an eight-year old? the kid is meant to be the most intelligent person in the movie instead of professional terrorists? please, there's more reality in the matrix. also, the leader puts down his real pistol and ""accidentally"" picks up a plastic pistol; apparently, he could not tell the difference. even with a glove on, one should be able to do that. just because they look the same does not mean anything; there is other senses then sight. the traps are unrealistic as well; if any one of them actually worked, the criminals would be dead. but, hollywood intends for us to ""laugh"" at the ""funny"" results of the traps. i did not laugh; i sighed and rolled my eyes.  but, i recommend this movie to anyone who thinks they have seen a really bad movie; the movie they saw will seem like citizen kane compared to this one. otherwise, skip this one for the sake of your pride. home alone 3 also raises a question. we all know alex d. linz stars in the movie, but did he write it as well?",0

"first off there is nothing wrong with studying daniel, revelation, matthew 24, isaiah and other prophetic scriptures. there is also nothing wrong with making a film such as this to attempt to present the gospel message. so my qualms with this movie are not in either its sincerity or aspirations. as a christian, though an amillenialist, i believe there will be a great tribulation and i believe christ will return as he said as much. so even though i have disagreement with this film about the rapture that is not why i rate this movie so low.  no, what makes me rate this movie so low is not its sincerity or its message, but rather its lack of production values, awful script, mediocre acting, and pitiful fx. this movie ranks down there with some of the cheesiest scifi fodder of the 1950s. no, this movie ranks down there with plan 9 from outerspace. this movie failed to age well and was probably dated by the time they made a sequel.  the apocalypse genre film producers could have learned how not to make an end times film from this, but they failed. the left behind series, the apocalypse series, and the omega code series all failed to learn from this because they addressed the fx problems and the dated look problem, but their scripts are still poor, and their acting is wooden.  there are great christian films, with extremely low budgets, but this film is not one of them. i'm surprised the mst3k crew never lampooned this one.",0

"before i explain the ""alias"" comment let me say that ""the desert trail"" is bad even by the standards of westerns staring the three stooges. in fact it features carmen laroux as semi- bad girl juanita, when you hear her mexican accent you will immediately recognize her as senorita rita from the classic stooge short ""saved by the belle"".   in ""the desert trail"" john wayne gets to play the moe howard character and eddy chandler gets to play curly howard. like their stooge counterparts a running gag throughout the 53- minute movie is moe hitting curly. wayne's character, a skirt chasing bully, is not very endearing, but is supposed to be the good guy.   playing a traveling rodeo cowboy wayne holds up the rodeo box office at gunpoint and takes the prize money he would have won if the attendance proceeds had been good-the other riders have to settle for 25 cents on the dollar (actually even less after wayne robs the box office). no explanation is given for wayne's ripping off the riders and still being considered the hero who gets the girl.   things get complicated at this point because the villain (al ferguson) and his sidekick larry fine (played by paul fix-who would go on to play sheriff micah on television's ""the rifleman"") see wayne rob the box office and then steal the remainder of the money and kill the rodeo manager. moe and curly get blamed.   so moe and curly move to another town to get away from the law and they change their names to smith and jones. who do they meet first but their old friend larry, whose sister becomes the 2nd half love interest (senorita rita is left behind it the old town and makes no further appearances in the movie).   larry's sister is nicely played by a radiantly beautiful mary kornman (now grown up but in her younger days she was one of the original cast members of hal roach's ""our gang"" shorts). kornman is the main reason to watch the mega-lame western and her scenes with moe and curly are much better than any others in the production, as if they used an entirely different crew to film them.   even for 1935 the action sequences in this thing are extremely weak and the technical film- making is staggeringly bad. the two main chase scenes end with stock footage wide shots of a rider falling from a horse. both times the editor cuts to a shot of one of the characters rolling on the ground, but there is no horse in the frame, the film stock is completely different, and the character has on different clothes than the stunt rider. there is liberal use of stock footage in other places, none of it even remotely convincing.   one thing to watch for is a scene midway into the movie where moe and curly get on their horses and ride away (to screen right) from a cabin as the posse is galloping toward the cabin from the left. the cameraman follows the two stooges with a slow pan right and then does a whip pan to the left to reveal the approaching posse. outside of home movies i have never seen anything like this, not because it is looks stupid (which it does) but because a competent director would never stage a scene in this manner. they would film the two riders leaving and then reposition the camera and film the posse approaching as a separate action. or if they were feeling creative they would stage the sequence so the camera shows the riders in the foreground and the posse approaching in the background.   then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.",0
"as a movie critic for several dutch websites, i have to see lot's of movies, and not all very good ones. some movies are so bad, you won't be surprised that they are released straight on video. with taboo, iám surprised that it is released on video at all. this is really low budget bad quality bad written rubbish.   a group of youngsters plays a game of taboo. they write down their most sickening wish or act, and later on people are murdered for their taboo's. the question is, should we believe what we see?  the movie has a potential interesting plot-twist, and i won't give it away here. but what could have been interesting stays stupid, bad acted and without any reason.  some of the actors have played in bigger titles before, so why on earth did they sign up for this? if you see this anywhere, try to dodge it. there is no logic, no human sense of quality in this movie.",0
"when this movie was released, it spawned one of the all-time great capsule movie reviews: sphinx stinks. it does, but in a mesmerizing sort of way. the casting is silly, starting at the top: frank langella and sir john gielgud as egyptians? not enough makeup in cairo for that, at least not while this film was being made. but it's rather amusing to see them try. the performances run the gamut from mummy-like (sorry, the obvious observation) to over-the-top, with very few stops in between. the lesley-anne down character seems as though she couldn't find egypt on a map, much less expound upon its archaeological treasures. that's due at least in part to some really bad writing, one of the curses that will be visited upon every viewer of this movie. it's my opinion that movies involving a curse or that draw their basis from a subject that is somewhat esoteric, such as egyptology, are ripe for silly, overwritten dialogue. it doesn't disappoint, and the convergence proves a double-whammy. the plot has one driving source of dramatic tension: can this get dumber and less believable? the answer is, usually, yes. the location shots are beautiful, and the set design is generally very good, the only consistent reminders that this wasn't some low-budget production. that and the fact that there are so many well-known faces doing service in such an unintentional laugher. cheap, no; cheesy, yes.",0
"all good movies ""inspire"" some direct to video copycat flick. i was afraid that ""gladiator"" wasn't really that good a film, because i hadn't seen any movie that had anything remotely resembling anything roman on the new releases shelf for months. then i spotted full moon's latest offering, demonicus. i'm a fan of full moon's puppetmaster series, and blood dolls, but had never seen one of their non-killer puppet films. anyway...  demonicus chronicles what happens to a group of campers in the mountains of the alps. one of the campers, james, finds a cave with old gladiator artifacts, and feels impelled to remove a helmet from a corpse and try it on. he becomes possessed, and, as the demonic gladiator tyrannus, is impelled to kill his friends to revive the corpse, who is the real tyrannus.  granted, like many full moon films, this has little or no budget. at times, the editing and direction was so amateurish i'd swear i was watching the blair witch project. the attempts at chopping off of limbs and heads reminds me of a monty python skit. the weapons, although apparently real, look really plastic-y. it literally looks like this was filmed by a group of friends with a digital camcorder on a weekend. granted, there's nothing wrong with such film-making, just don't rent this expecting a technical masterpiece. it looks like there were attempts at research for the script too, because, even though tyrannus really doesn't act much like a gladiator until the end, at least he speaks latin.  all trashing aside, i actually enjoyed this film. not as much as a killer puppet film, perhaps, but full moon still delivers! the only thing that disappointed me was there was no full moon videozone at the end!",1

"the story of the boy thief of bagdad (as it was once spelled) has attracted filmmakers from raoul walsh in 1924, who starred douglas fairbanks in the first, silent, rendering of ""thief of bagdad,"" to less imposing, more recent attempts. the best, however, remains 1940's version which for its time was a startling, magical panoply of top quality special effects. those effects still work their charm.  no less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred sabu as the boy thief, abu, john justin as the dreamily in love deposed monarch, ahmad and june duprez as the lovely princess sought by ahmad and pursued by the evil vizier, jaffar, played by a sinister conrad veidt. the giant genie is ably acted by rex ingram.  ahmad is treacherously deposed by jaffar and when later arrested by that traitorous serpent, he and the boy, abu, suffer what are clearly incapacitating fates. ahmad is rendered blind and abu becomes a lovable mutt. their adventures through the gaily decorated hollywood backlots are fun but the special effects make this film work.  two men were responsible for everything from a magic flying carpet to the gargantuan genie who pops out of a bottle with a tornado-like black swirl: lawrence w. butler and tom howard. (howard, incidentally, did the special effects for the 1961 version of this film. both men had long and distinguished careers in technical wizardry.)  duprez is outstandingly lovely while little called on for serious acting. justin's ahmad projects a driven but dreamy romanticism untouched by erotic impulses. sabu is really the central actor in many scenes and he's very good. for a movie meant for kids as well as adults there's a fair amount of violence but of the bloodless kind. still, i don't think anyone under eight ought to see ""thief of bagdad.""  this film makes periodic appearances on tv but today my teenage son and i saw it in a theater with quite a few youngsters present. it was great to see computer-besotted kids in an affluent community respond with cheers and applause to special effects that must seem primitive to them.  ""thief of bagdad"" is a pre-war hollywood classic from a time when strong production values often resulted in enduringly attractive and important releases. this is one of the best of its kind.  9/10.",1
"i just viewed detention last night and i liked what i saw. it was a cool fun movie.dolph looked superbly cool on the bike.he also looked good in this movie as compared to his other recent movies.he is now in a pretty good shape.the story was ok and the other actors were also passable.i wouldn't call this movie his best but its still a good movie.  but it also had its share of problems. the first one was the way bullets were flying everywhere and even when they were being fired at point blank range they missed the target.they should've had shown the ppl escaping the bullets in a better way. another problem which i had was the way the students were swearing. i dont know in which school the students can swear in front of their teacher and even in the classroom. the third problem was that the bad guys were very few in numbers. there should've been more bad guys. last problem was definately the fact that the set looked cheesy , but that was due to the small budget. overall the movie was a good movie.i enjoyed it.i would recommend others to watch it. p.s. now u r a dead beat cop.

"when the us entered world war i, the government forced hollywood to churn out propaganda films. the little american is probably the best of the lot because it stars mary pickford.  pickford plays a young woman torn between two men: jack holt (german) and raymond hatton (french), but her decision is delayed because of the war as both men enlist.  when the ship pickford is sailing on is sunk by the germans (think lusitania) because it is carrying munitions, pickford has a great scene as she stands on the lifeboat and yells at the german commander. later on, of course, she runs into both holt and hatton when she is being held as a war prisoner at a château.  director cecil b. demille provides one truly great scene in this film as pickford and holt are wandering through a bombed-out village. they pass a destroyed church of which only one wall remains standing. against the wall is a very large crucifix. as they stand and watch, the wall collapses but the jesus figure remains, suspended in mid air. it's a very surreal moment in a film that is otherwise very straightforward and un-artsy.  pickford is, as always, a pleasure to watch. she was always a very natural actress who avoided the arm-waving histrionics many other actors of the day used. she's also very very pretty. holt is very good here in a leading-man role. hatton is ok. among the list of name actors in ""extra"" parts are wallace beery, ramon novarro, colleen moore, ben alexander, hobart bosworth, norman kerry, walter long, james neill, and edythe chapman.  not a great film, but interesting to see us propaganda at work.",1
"in its way, mister foe (originally, and more appropriately, titled hallam foe  i can't see addressing its title character as ""mister""), is a tribute to good acting. both jamie bell, as hallam, a physically attractive voyeur/creep, and sophia myles, as kate, his kinky partner in sex and fantasy romance, are convincing. the problem comes when you try to connect their roles to anything that happens in real life. a young man who spies on the intimate details of people's lives the way hallam does would be deservedly beaten to a pulp. and a woman in kate's situation would be repulsed and frightened - she would probably call the police.  these things are not, however, what happens in the movie. poor hallam's mother has died and his father married a woman with whom he's been having an affair. hallam, of course, hates his stepmother and lets he know it. she has sex with him. kate's some kind of an employment person who places hallam in a dish washing job and plays sexual games. she looks like his birth mother. it all ends happily with hallam ""resolving"" his ""issues"".  forty some years ago, the play and brilliantly acted movie, who's afraid of virginia woolf, had a similarly optimistic ending, with characters becoming wiser and better after tearing each other apart. the trouble is, it doesn't always work that way, especially when nobody really cares. in virginia woolf, the ending's plausible because of the intensity of the emotional revelation. in mister foe, the emotional revelation never really happens.",0

"thank g_d it bombed, or we might get treated to such delights as ""skate fu"" where we can see the likes of brian boitano performing a triple lutz & slashing bad guys to ribbons with his razor-sharp skates, but i digress. one thing that could have helped this turkey would have been a little t & a from ms. agbayani. it's not like the world would have seen anything new (at least that part of the world who saw her playboy spread.) i truly believe that porn would have suited her 'talents' much better, although aubrey hepburn couldn't have stayed afloat in this sewer. one explanation for kurt thomas' presence could be a traumatic brain injury, possibly from coming up short too often on dismounts. it's a good thing the ioc wasn't as diligent on 'doping' as they are now, or kurt would surely have been stripped of his medals. to be avoided at all costs.",0
"this film evil breed: the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort. it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast ""slasher"" style death and plain disgusting acts of death. the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability, and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable. the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different. the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn't offer much, and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death. example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus, and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes. it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up. this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture.",1

"despite having known people who are either great fans of noam chomsky, or think he's a tired relic from the 1960s, i really had no opinion of the man, save that i knew he gained fame as a linguist, although i could not elucidate any of his theories, and that he was a liberal socialist with marxist leanings. so, stumbling across the dvd of the 2003 documentary noam chomsky: rebel without a pause, in a used video store, a film which followed him on a 2002 book tour for his book 9-11, i decided to get it, just so i could have a little bit of knowledge about the man the next time a person, pro or con, spoke of him. while glad i got the film, my initial reaction to this dull and ill edited hagiography was, so what's all the fuss about?  for a man with so many degrees, lauded as 'the most important intellectual alive', by the new york times, according to the dvd's case, there sure was not a lot there, intellectually speaking. i know i would chew him up and spit him out in a debate, and i wouldn't even want to watch what a william f. buckley could do to him. granted, the whole film was seemingly about chomsky seeing conspiracies everywhere, and having glazed eyed coeds nod in bewildering approval of the most inane and outrageous things he'd say, rather than being on linguistics, so maybe that's the reason he came off so badly. but, again, if he is a linguist, and tops in his field, why in the world would anyone care what he has to say on anything outside his field of expertise?. even worse are his acolytes, who seem to further insulate the man from reality, by fostering delusions that chomsky is a target for zionist assassins. what little i knew of chomsky before watching this film, this much i knew: he was generally considered a has been, and pretty much irrelevant intellectually, since the fall of the soviet empire. the film is so poorly structured, and without a narrative thread, that it's difficult to separate all of the jumble. his wife, carol, as example, apparently gave one interview, which was chopped up and dropped wherever in the film. she seems a nice enough woman, but wholly out of her element answering anything but the most basic questions about their life. the lone interesting thing she says is that 9/11 was a great thing for the chomskys, for he has reaped a great deal of money in speaking fees since then.  not surprisingly, this sort of film gives almost no biographical background. it's assumed that all viewers must know all the plaudits this 'great man' bears. chomsky is rarely interviewed one on one. stylistically, there are no camera movements, no interesting edits, nor any signature touches, and most of the film is disjunct rambles by chomsky, videotaped huzzahs of chomsky declaiming on this or that, and slack-jawed and awed students looking at him as if he were immaterial, that is when dimwitted coeds are not asking barely audible and ridiculously simplistic questions to him. this is really poor film-making by director and editor will pascoe, who in the dvd's filmmaker statement, shows he's yet another uncritical acolyte of chomsky's. other than that, one of the surest signs that this is not an objective documentary, but mere agitprop, and a vanity piece of agitprop, at that, is that not a single time is chomsky shown struggling with an answer. he seems to be a font of knowledge that has no bounds.  given that much of this dreck was filmed during chomsky's lectures at mcmaster university, in ontario, canada, prior to the american invasion of iraq in 2003, much of what chomsky says seems as remote as things from the vietnam war era. yes, he makes some good points, here and there, on american media complicity before the war, but he follows them up with sheer lunacy, for he seems to not realize that most conspiracies are ad hoc, and not fully plotted out cabals. as example, he claims that the advertising industry is a cabal that mercilessly controls the populace, but says not a word about the zombied populace that lets itself be so controlled. similarly, he claims trilateralists run the world and that people's fear of crime is yet another cabal's result. of course, that claim so fully explains away rape crisis centers, and all that wasted time and money district attorneys' offices consume. he also makes the absurd claim that cuba has been the victim of terrorism for decades, when castro and company were great sponsors of it, in latin america, asia, and africa, until the soviet union fell. i can only guess that the ufo conspiracists are just waiting for chomsky to proclaim that gray aliens have set up species-mixing impregnation centers up in idaho.  in his simpleminded world without grays, chomsky is frighteningly as dense as the members of bushco, whom he reviles, are; even more so since they lay no claim to being intellectuals. in short, chomsky is a man living in the past, in over his head on most issues, and out of his depth intellectually. near this film's end he warns, 'be cautious when you hear about intellectuals being fighters for justice,' yet one can only laugh, as the man seemingly has never met a revolutionary person nor idea that he didn't like, no matter how barbarous their crimes, and anti-intellectual their posit. please, pause before you waste your time and money on this silly, and already irrelevant, dvd.",0
"having low expectations going in, the opening new footage (clocked at over five minutes) of 'husbands' came as a pleasant surprise. i won't say the new footage was grade a material, but it provided a very solid foundation for what ""could have been"" a good all-original film.  unfortunately, this was put together in 1955, during a time of one day shooting schedules. after the new footage, jules white decided to just thumbtack stock footage from 'brideless groom' into this short, making for a not-so-smooth story transition, which jules and felix adler try to remedy with a quickie bit of new footage at the end, giving us the old, worn-out ending of the boys (moe & larry in this case) getting shot in the butt.  3/10",0

"the problem with the 1985 version of this movie is simple; indiana jones was so closely modeled after alan quartermain (or at least is an alan quartermain type of character), that the '85 director made the mistake of plundering the ij movies for dialog and story far too deeply. what you got as a finished product was a jumbled mess of the name alan quartermain, in an uneven hodge podge of a cheaply imitated ij saga (with a touch of austin powers-esquire cheese here and there).   it was labeled by many critics to have been a ""great parody,"" or ""unintentional comedy."" unintentional is the word. this movie was never intended to be humorous; witty, yes, but not humorous. unfortunately, it's witless rather than witty.  with this new m4tv mini-series, you get much more story, character development of your lead, solid portrayals, and a fine, even, entertaining blend. this story is a bit long; much longer than its predecessors, but deservedly so as this version carries a real storyline and not just action and eye candy. while it features both action and eye candy, it also corrects the mistake made in the 1985 version by forgetting ij all together and going back to the source materials for aq, making for a fine, well - thought - out plot, and some nice complementing sub-plots.   now this attempt is not the all out action-extravaganza that is indiana jones. nor is it a poor attempt to be so. this vehicle is plot and character driven and is a beautiful rendition of the aq/ksm saga. filmed on location in south africa, the audience is granted beautiful (if desolate) vistas, sa aboriginal cultures, and some nice wildlife footage to blend smoothly with the performances and storyline here.  steve boyum totally surprised me with this one, as i have never been one to subscribe to his vision. in fact, i have disliked most of his work as a director, until this attempt. i hope this is more a new vein of talent and less the fluke that it seems to be.   this version rates a 9.8/10 on the ""tv"" scale from...  the fiend :.",1

"a young woman (jean simmons) is convinced by her scheming and dangerous aunt (sonia dresdel) and uncle (barry jones) that she's losing her mind and in very delicate condition that requires their supervision which turns out to be more like manipulation, as they try to keep her as far away from outside human contact as possible. the only other person she sees is the estate caretaker, a lascivious character played by maxwell reed, whose caught the wayward eye of the middle-aged aunt. all of this, the aunt and the caretaker, the butterfly expert uncle who has a serious underside to him, and the susceptible niece in the middle, would have made for a darker and more sinister film. as it is, a frame-up for a murder sends trevor howard (a fired government secret service agent who took a job at the estate cataloging butterflies) and simmons across the countryside escaping police, catching headlines of ""police net closing in"" over her front page photo, hopping on buses, and winding up in liverpool, where they meet some wonderfully cast characters, and finally face down the greedy and murderous aunt and uncle.",1
"thirty years after its initial release, the third version of ""a star is born"" finally comes to dvd in a package that should please the most devoted fans of barbra streisand. that would include me since i just saw her in concert singing among other numbers, the feminist anthem ""woman in the moon"" from this 1976 film. easy to dismiss, the movie's career-polarizing story is such a sturdy pile of hollywood-style clichés that variations of it exist in other films including streisand's own ""funny girl"". this time reset to the then-contemporary music scene, the timeworn plot follows self-destructive rock star john norman howard on his deep-dive career descent just as he meets club singer esther hoffman who is awaiting her big break.  troubles dog their courtship from the outset, as john norman (both names please) responds to grasping fans and bloodless djs with random acts of violence (from which he inexplicably escapes prosecution). to john norman, esther represents his last shot at happiness, and in turn, she is drawn to the innately decent, creative musician underneath the façade. in the movie's most pivotal scene, he gives esther her big break at a benefit concert, and her career takes off. inevitably, he can't handle the failure of his career in light of her meteoric success, and if you are familiar with any version of this story, you know the rest. directed by frank pierson (although streisand's budding directorial talents are obviously on display), the film still manages to draw me in, even though i know it is shamelessly contrived and manipulative. it still has a certain emotional resonance despite its numerous flaws.  although streisand in her prime seems like the ideal choice to play a rising singing star, her screen persona is simply too strong and predefined to play esther credibly. the same can be said for her performing style since the script seems to make allowances for her softer adult contemporary-oriented material to be accepted within the otherwise hardened world of arena rock. from the moment she pops her head up as the middle of the oreos, she can't help but come across as an established star. i can forgive the lapse simply because she is an unparalleled vocal talent, but what becomes less forgiving is how she makes esther more strident than poignant when john norman's woes become overwhelming. this creates an oddly discomfiting dynamic in the last part of the film when it becomes less about what caused the climactic event than esther's response to it. this is capped off by an uninterrupted eight-minute close-up of her memorial performance - great except when she regrettably mimics john norman's style toward the end.  kristofferson, on the other hand, gives a superb performance throughout, managing a level of honesty that grounds the film and makes palpable his concurrent feelings of love, pride and resentment toward esther. he makes his vodka-soaked onstage growling work within this context. otherwise, what always strikes me as strange about this version is how all the supporting characters are relegated to the background as if they didn't exist unless they were interacting with the two principals. the only ones who register are paul mazursky as john norman's level-headed manager brian and gary busey as his cynical band manager bobbie. veteran cameraman robert surtees provides a nice burnish to the cinematography though a level of graininess persists in the print. a big seller in its day, the soundtrack is a hodgepodge of different styles from the 1970's - some songs still quite good (""everything"", ""woman in the moon"", ""watch closely now""), some that have moved to kitsch (""queen bee"", kenny loggins' ""i believe in love"") and of course, the inescapable ""evergreen"".  the print transfer on the 2006 dvd is clean and the sound gratefully crisp thanks to digital remastering. streisand's participation is the chief lure of the extras beginning with her feature-length commentary. she gives insightful information about the genesis of the film, the casting and the reportedly troubled production. she is also refreshingly candid about the megalomania of jon peters, her hairdresser boyfriend who became the movie's producer, and her dissatisfaction with pierson as a director. i just wish she could have provided more scene-specific comments that directly relate to what is on screen. she also tends to repeat the same anecdotes when the mood strikes her, e.g., it gets tiring to hear for the third time how the person playing the chauffeur was a friend of peters. i think having a second commentator could have drawn out other nuggets from her.  there is a wardrobe test reel that shows some amusing 1970's clothes, especially kristofferson's mixed-fabric poncho and orange polyester shirt. there are also twelve deleted scenes included with streisand's optional commentary. one is a comic bread-baking scene which reminded me how much i like streisand in farcical comedies. another is an extended scene in which she plays ""evergreen"" on the guitar in front of an awestruck kristofferson who then falls asleep. the most interesting is an alternate take on the musical finale incorporating fast cuts, which i agree with streisand should have been used. fittingly, the theatrical trailers for all three versions of ""a star is born"" are also included.",1
it's this sort of movie that you try and imitate. by attempting to realise something... then flying through the air almost immediately. i'd like to do that and i know you would too!  great stuff!,1
"i almost saw this at an actual movie theatre (an art-house theatre, no less!) but couldn't make it there in the one whole week it played, but yesterday i finally saw it on cable and...well...i wasn't disappointed, that's for sure! madonna has done it again: yet another bomb! when will this woman learn? when will the studios learn? (or perhaps they already have, since this film was largely dumped, with little fanfare and deadly word-of-mouth.) one would hope that being directed by her talented husband, who's created some interesting and/or terribly entertaining work, would bring out the same quality madonna showed in ""desperately seeking susan""; alas, it just isn't meant to be, for here she is, at her very worst: singularly convinced of her own greatness, the smugness permeating every frame she's in, made all the more unbearable by her wavering faux-british accent, an accent that only underscores the fact that her speaking voice is immature in quality and not especially pleasant. this may sound unnecessarily cruel but listen to the woman, and look at her films of, say, the past decade: like a latter-day bette davis, there is an unmistakable brittleness to not only her carriage but to her very face and body, which here, despite the warm photography displayed throughout the film (perhaps its only saving grace), are done no favors. to her credit, the entire affair is so misbegotten that one wonders if the world's greatest actress on her best day could do anything with this mess. no one involved escapes unharmed: bruce greenwood actually seems pained to be on-screen, though poor jeanne tripplehorn seems to carry herself as if she's actually in something good, which had me thinking all the while, ""denial ain't just a river in egypt!"" adriano giannini, son of giancarlo giannini, star of the italian original, ""swept away..."", is, like his father before him, immensely attractive, and isn't altogether bad (despite winning a razzie nomination for ""worst actor""), but, like almost everything else about this production, it all comes back to madonna, on whose shoulders rest the blame. why her? why not her husband, director guy ritchie? just who do you think was behind this remake? what actress wouldn't want nearly every shot of a movie to be centered on her, with only a relative nobody sharing the screen? oh sure, ritchie deserves some blame: surely he - or someone - anyone! - should have, and could have, taken his lead aside and insisted on something bordering on actual feeling in her line readings (for her performance is so wooden it's a surprise the rest of the cast didn't get splinters), or at least display a semblance of warmth...but she seems resistant to be anything but a cinematic black hole. above and beyond anything else, this is strictly a vanity project for its star so she is ultimately accountable for it. a film like this, an ""odd couple""-ish, war of the classes, should be light and fun, with leads who can bounce off one another with witty, even romantic, dialogue, for what else can a film whose plot involves two disparate people stranded, really be? honestly, i don't think anyone involved knew exactly the tone they were trying for; it succeeds neither as comedy (i defy you to laugh even once) or romance (madonna's ice-princess routine precludes any chemistry). it's not even bad enough for us bad-movie lovers to enjoy. a real shame...",0
"yes, people are racist. people are even racist in college. that's a good point, and the issue of racism has been dealt with many times before in countless films. what sets higher learning apart from the pack is that it deals with the issue of racism in the most ham-fisted and predictable way possible, oh yeah it's in college too.  this film deals with this problem of racism the way frankenstein deals with most problems, it bashes you over the head repeatedly in a brutal and sluggish manner. most of the characters are cartoonish, one-dimensional, caricatures (lesbian feminist, angry black man), that react to situations as dramatically and predictably as possible. instead of defying stereotypes this film is overpopulated with them. the angry black men feel cheated, feminists hate men, etc. (one feminist even holds a sign that reads ""dead men don't rape."" see what i mean?) i don't want to give anything away, but in this movie if someone seems like a shifty loner or a date rapist they'll probably behave exactly how you expect them to. the changes the characters go through seems obvious to everyone but the people in the movie. the big twist in the plot hinges on whether or not the violent neo-nazis will act like violent neo-nazis. i'll guess you'll just have to watch to find out what happens.  another problem i have with this movie is that it's supposed to be ""gritty"" and ""hard-hitting,"" but they make nazis the bad guys. i agree nazis are evil, but that's my point. everybody thinks nazis are bad; we're not breaking any new ground here. nazis have been portrayed as villains since the 1930's. the film doesn't challenge any viewpoints or make bold statements. it just deals with issues we all know about in a clumsy, after-school-special like, manner. being anti-rape, anti-racist, and anti-nazi isn't exactly taking a hard stance on a controversial issue.  higher learning is predictable, cartoonish, and in a word stupid. avoid at all costs.",0
"i wonder how much this movie actually has got to do with the 1984 movie ""bachelor party"", starring tom hanks. is this movie even an official sequel? this movie is lacking in every department and you're obviously better off not watching it.  for a comedy this movie simply isn't good or funny enough. it relies mostly on the character's their stereotypical assessments, rather then the movie actually features some good, original and funny moments.  of course there also is very little story present and the movie nude breast than script pages. you just keep waiting for things to finally start off. there is a main plot line in it somewhere but that one is so terribly unoriginal and gets executed so poorly in the movie that it feels more as if it's something non-existent. i guess there even is a message and moral story in it somewhere but this again is so terribly unoriginal and poorly done in the movie that it simply does not work out.  it's basically a typical teenage comedy, with lots of sex jokes and nudity, only without the teenage main characters, which makes the story all the more sad and tasteless. the movie makes some really wrong jokes, that are misplaced for any type of movie.  i regret ever watching this.  3/10",0
"...thankfully he hasn't, yet! this is crude, simplistic student politics made into drama. it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits. conceit 1: that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left. conceit 2: that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister's only critics are sinister civil servants, mi5, big business and the americans (naturally). conceit 3: that this radical socialist pm can solve all union, economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation. conceit 4: that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing. conceit 5: that the soviet union isn't a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80's. and finally, conceit 6: that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d'etat against britain.  it's ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti-thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises. when it was made, television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience. ray mcinally's performance was great, which is one of the few plus points. history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show.",0
"in 1954 marlon brando was the hot actor after his performances in streetcar named desire and on the waterfront. frank sinatra had yet to re-invent himself on the silver screen. but sinatra's portrayal as the erstwhile nathan detroit, helped re-establish sinatra with his fans.  it is a great screen version of a great play and the choices of leads and support players are terrific. imagine a movie where brando sings? this was his one and only singing role as he portrayed sky masterson. in addition the female leads, jean simmons and vivian blaine(replaying her stage role as nathan's long suffering girlfriend adelade), put in superlative efforts. special mention goes to the great stubby kaye(as nicely nicely), and with all due respect to eric clapton, no one's version of rockin' the boat even comes close to stubby's. sheldon leonard, who would go on to fame as tv producer of such shows as the danny thomas show and the dick van dyke show does ""harry the horse"" wonders, b.s.pulley is excellent as the harsh mannered and rough talking ""big julie"", and even regis toomey offers his excellence as ""brother arvide"".  it is one of the fun musicals to see, good comedy, and you get sinatra and brando. soooooo ""luck be a lady tonight"" and brother...""it's your dice""",1
"tripping over. i must say at first i was a little disappointed in the first few episodes, but having faith in the show, and abe forsythe's unquestionable talent, i continued to watch. i can safely say i'm now glad that i did. the story did develop quite well, and all the characters have a strong base, and most don't have any information missing.  the only thing i can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character lizzie.  some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line. here's to hoping for another season!",1
"i don't know how to describe this movie. it's definitely one of the weirdest movies i've seen in a long time. it is very unsettling at times but also boring in other places. the scenes of dental torture are very elaborate and may attract anyone who's into gore & splatter. i found myself holding my teeth during some of the aforementioned scenes. the clever thing about the movie is that it plays with our fears and the dentist is therefore quite unsettling.  the humor of the film is somehow hidden and may not be recognized by everyone. but if you're a fan of weird and strange entertainment and teeth getting drilled to dust this is just the film you were looking for.  if you read the comment and feel somehow attracted by this kind of entertainment, give it a try!  my rating: 4/10 (maybe a little too weird for my taste)",0
"hollywood hotel was the last movie musical that busby berkeley directed for warner bros. his directing style had changed or evolved to the point that this film does not contain his signature overhead shots or huge production numbers with thousands of extras. by the last few years of the thirties, swing-style big bands were recording the year's biggest popular hits. the swing era, also called the big band era, has been dated variously from 1935 to 1944 or 1939 to 1949. although it is impossible to exactly pinpoint the moment that the swing era began, benny goodman's engagement at the palomar ballroom in los angeles in the late summer of 1935 was certainly one of the early indications that swing was entering the consciousness of mainstream america's youth. when goodman featured his swing repertoire rather than the society-style dance music that his band had been playing, the youth in the audience went wild. that was the beginning, but, since radio, live concerts and word of mouth were the primary methods available to spread the phenomena, it took some time before swing made enough inroads to produce big hits that showed up on the pop charts. in hollywood hotel, the appearance of benny goodman and his orchestra and raymond paige and his orchestra in the film indicates that the film industry was ready to capitalize on the shift in musical taste (the film was in production only a year and a half or so after goodman's palomar ballroom engagement). there are a few interesting musical moments here and there in hollywood hotel, but except for benny goodman and his orchestra's ""sing, sing, sing,"" there isn't a lot to commend. otherwise, the most interesting musical sequences are the opening ""hooray for hollywood"" parade and ""let that be a lesson to you"" production number at the drive-in restaurant. the film is most interesting to see and hear benny goodman and his orchestra play and dick powell and frances langford sing.",0
"this is one of those movies that made me feel strongly for the need of making movies at all. generally speaking, i am a fan of movies based on worthy true stories. and this one is great! besides meryl's performance which has gained a lot of recognition and praise, the movie's greatest asset is the story it is based on. the riveting tale of a couple who suffer social and legal torture, after having undergone enormous emotional pain at the unexpected and brutal death of their infant child is really an eye-opening fable that exposes the inhumane side of fellow humans, and uncovers the barbarism of a very refined and lawful society. it is interesting to see how people who consider themselves as kind and intelligent people (the emotional jury ladies in the movie for example) are in reality nothing more than selfish dupes who would, for their dogmatic beliefs and prejudices, shut their brains to any deliberation and contemplation even in the light of all facts pointing very clearly against their opinions. the other face of the so-called ""civilized"" society that the movie exposes is the apathy to the pain of fellow human beings (needless to say, this is very general, even though this specific tale unfolds in australia), that goes as far as becoming a true cruelty. must see if you are willing to take something serious and perhaps thought-provoking.",1
"here's one more beauty in the string of beautiful films directed by eytan fox. the movie presents the story of star-crossed lovers (one israeli, one palestinian)in modern tel aviv. the film's effectiveness comes not only from its depiction of cross-ethnic conflict, but of conflicts personal and political within ethnic groups as well. for example, there's a telling moment when one of the secondary characters, openly gay, is visited in the hospital by his boyfriend who brings him flowers and tries to kiss him in front of his visiting family, and suddenly we see a wave of awkward discomfort wash through the room. clearly the young man is not as open as he seems, and the family not as accepting as he might want them to be, while the boyfriend is confused and rejected. a good deal of complexity is packed into a fleeting moment. as we know from yossi & jagger, fox is a master at efficiently packing emotional and psychological complexity into brief sequences. the film is also effective for the even-handed way it presents the mutual brutalities that israelies and palestinians inflict on each other. if you're not heartless, you'll cry through the last third of the movie. though the plot is melodramatic, it's so intelligently written and acted that it reminds us of how satisfying good melodrama can be.",1
"this is one military drama i like a lot! tom berenger playing military assassin thomas beckett. this marine is no-nonsense, in your face, and no questions asked kind of person who gets the job done. there you have billy zane(""the phantom"" and others) who plays richard miller, a former swat form d.c., works for the government and takes orders only from them. who needs a bureaucrat? i don't! when these two are paired, sparks should be flying. and how. however, beckett teaches the young bureaucrat on how it works. when the other sniper hits, it's wits vs. wits, cat vs. mouse, gunman vs. gunman. and when the seasoned sniper is caught, it's up to miller to put politics aside and save him. who needs politics when you a pro like beckett, he took orders from no one but himself, plays by the rules and not the book, and mutual respect is brought out despite the politics. the movie was a direct hit. watch it. rating 4 out of 5 stars.",1
"possible spoilers, perhaps. i must say that ""cinderella ii: dreams come true"" is one of the worst movies ever made. first of all, the movie was made during the height of disney's sequel rampage. it was created around the same time as ""the little mermaid ii,"" ""the jungle book ii,"" and ""peter pan ii,"" all of which were disservices to their original film classics. (disney also made ""the hunchback of notre dame ii"" and ""atlantis ii,"" but i'm going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place."") let me go ahead and say that i am an avid supporter of good disney films, and i absolutely adore the original disney ""cinderella."" the sequel to ""cinderella,"" however, was a waste of time. the character of cinderella in the sequel was so very unlike the original girl that i grew up watching. in the original, cinderella was kind and loving. the new cinderella had very out-of-character moments with current-era phrasing like, ""i'm going to do this banquet my way!"" let me also tell you that new cinderella (as i have affectionately named her) says, ""ewww!"" that is the anti-cinderella. i try to find the best in people, but in the sequel, anastasia, one of the stepsisters, is good! what the heck? why? they made it all out to be like lady tremaine and drizella are just horrible family members for poor little anastasia. my question to the world: did the people at disney watch the original ""cinderella"" when making this sequel? well, it surely doesn't seem so. if i remember correctly, anastasia was just as abusive to cinderella as drizella and lady tremaine. i am all for redemption and forgiveness, but there was no point of redemption for anastasia in this movie. in the first one, anastasia was evil. in the second one, she is good. one just can't leave a story like this. i hope disney realizes that this movie, among other movies, is shaming walt disney's name. perhaps now that michael eisner is gone, things will start shaping up around the house of mouse.",0

"hood of the living dead had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began. first, any play on ""...of the living dead"" invokes his holiness mr. romero and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire. and second, my movie-watching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal leprechaun in the hood. skeptical, we settled in to watch.   we were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and good-hearted zombie film. oh, certainly the budget is low, and of course the directors' amateurs friends populate the cast, but hood of the living dead loves zombie cinema. cheap? yeah. but when it's this cheap, you can clearly see where love holds it together.   ricky works in a lab during the day and as a surrogate parent to his younger brother at night. he dreams of moving out of oakland. before this planned escape, however, his brother is shot to death in a drive-by. ricky's keen scientific mind presents an option superior to cpr or 911: injections of his lab's experimental regenerative formula. sadly, little bro wakes up in an ambulance as a bloodthirsty oakland zombie! chaos and mayhem! i think it's more economical to eat your enemies than take vengeance in a drive-by, but then again, i'm a poor judge of the complexities of urban life. (how poor a judge? in response to a gory scene involving four men, i opined ""ah-ha! white t-shirts on everyone so the blood shows up. economical! i used the same technique in my own low-budget horror film."" jordan replied, ""no, that's gang dress. white t-shirts were banned from new orleans bars for a time as a result."" oh.)  a lot of the movie is set in someone's living room, so there's a great deal of hanging out and waiting for the zombies. but the characters are sympathetic and the movie is sincere-- it surpasses its budget in spirit.   zombie explanation: when man plays god, zombies arise! or, perhaps: follow fda-approved testing rules before human experimentation!   contribution to the zombie canon: this is the first zombie movie i've seen with a drive-by shooting. as far as the actual zombies go, infection is spread with a bite as usual, but quite unusually head shots don't work-- it's heart shots that kill. zombies have pulses, the absence of which proves true death. and these zombies make pretty cool jaguar-growl noises.   gratuitous zombie movie in-joke: a mercenary named romero. groan.   favorite zombie: jaguar-noise little brother zombie, of course!",1
"yes, the first ""howling"" was a classic. a rather good werewolf movie that i admit started slowly, but gained momentum along the way to have a rather good finish then the anchorwoman changed into a cute werewolf only to be gunned down on camera. yes that made for an entertaining horror movie to be sure...well forget all of that as this movie has nothing to do with that film. oh sure, they kind of make it out that the anchor woman is the same and that her brother or something is wanting to find out what and why things went down as they did, but they go from the little cozy retreat from the first movie to transylvania or somewhere here where they must battle evil magician werewolves or something. i often wonder what in the world christopher lee was doing in this movie, however i read the trivia here where it says he had never been in a werewolf movie before, but still read the script before you take a role. maybe you could have gotten into ""an american werewolf in london"" hell that could have been possible. it was set in london after all. heck, werewolves do not seem to figure much into this movie except for a rather bizarre and prolonged sex scene. in fact, the most memorable death in this movie for me was when the one gal started talking loudly and this one dude's ear's started bleeding.",0

"i love this movie!!! purple rain came out the year i was born and it has had my heart since i can remember. prince is so tight in this movie. i went to a special showing of purple rain last night and it was like a concert i was glad to see some true fans cause this movie is so undervalued, it is really one of the greatest movies of all time. the music is untouchable. the movie is about ""the kid"", played by prince, his family is dysfunctional, his band is the hottest act in town, and he has his eyes on the apollonia, an aspiring singer. there is no question why purple is my favorite color i can thank ""the kid"" for that. so if you have not seen this then you are need to asap. this is a classic - 4ever!",1
"besides planes, trains and automobiles and uncle buck, this is john candy's funniest movie. when he gets hypnotized with the playing card (similar to the manchurian candidate) and becomes a horny guy who does not know what he is saying, he makes two very memorable quotes (both deal with the male anatomy). the love scene involving grocery items has to be seen, it cannot be described.

"if you really want to know how most of the actors and directors in the hollywood scene ""made it"" to where they are, the vast majority will tell you (assuming they will tell) that a strange coincidence took place. they happened to meet the right people at the right time and get into the right project which led to other connections and other projects. quinten tarrantino took an acting class whose instructor knew harvey keitel. kevin spacey lifted a back stage pass from a sleeping old woman at the lecture of a famous playwright who helped him land an important role. and robin williams credits his career to gary marshall's son who, after having seen ""star wars"", suggested to his father that an alien should visit the cunninghams of ""happy days"". these coincidences, many times viewed as pure luck, shapes many of the careers in hollywood today. or is it pure luck? is possible something else is going on? ""grand canyon"" written and directed by lawrence kasdan, proposes an altogether different explanation for the inexplicable, aka the strange miraculous coincidence. the movie concerns several different characters whose lives intersect because of positive and yet inexplicable happenstance.  kevin kline, a middle-aged father, experiences a break-down in one of the more dangerous areas of la. after he phones a tow truck, a young gang accosts him. they threaten violence if he doesn't leave his car. just before the confrontation can escalate, danny glover appears as the tow truck driver and dampens the intentions of the gang. although glover denies it later, he probably saved kline's life. a producer (steve martin) of cheap violent films gets shot in the leg and after wards has a spiritual experience. he then announces retirement from producing blood and gore entertainment. and kline's wife, clair (mary mcdonnell), while on a morning jog, finds a baby hidden in some foliage. she claims the baby cried for her and that her ""rescue"" of the infant was preordained.  the movie explores further the results of these strange connections that lead to further relationships, end to relationships, and new beginnings. and all the while, a strange homeless man appears throughout the movie as if somehow he is also connected to everything that is going on.  it is very rare in hollywood, or for film in general, to explore such a purely esoteric subject. there are a few moments that seem somewhat unbelievable, but maybe that's the point. what makes the film work is the superb acting by the cast. although the miracles and coincidences may seem far-fetched, the actors make you believe they are experiencing these new realities. maybe this is a subject we should explore more often.",1
"i went into this with my hopes up, by twenty minutes into the movie i couldn't have been more let down. despite thinking that this would be another horribly bad remake, i kept my hopes high that maybe...just maybe someone would get it right this time around. sadly, prom night is about on the same quality level as the recent april fools day remake, bad script, bad direction, cheesy overdone acting and generally bad horror.  from beginning to end it's boring, repetitive and worthy of about a dozen eye rolls. we've seen it all before and we've seen it done a million times better then this. if you go to see prom night in the theater (i'd say wait for the dvd or ppv), get ready for the audience to laugh, because laugh they will. the laughs aren't at points in the movie that are supposed to be funny, they are in response to key ""thrilling"" moments in the film that are so poorly done you feel as if your watching the newest installment of scary movie. seriously, was this supposed to be a remake or a spoof? the film makers missed the mark so badly here, that a large number of the audience in the theater i attended walked out about halfway through the movie. which in retrospect, i wish i had done. not me though, i had to torture myself and stick with it hoping it would get better. needless to say it didn't. the ""horror"" scenes are a joke, not even so much because of the acting but because of the direction, the script, the ""special effects"" and the camera work. the movie manages to look as if they spent a fortune to produce it, but still came out of it with a micro budget movie. i halfway expected to see dollar store tags on some of the props and kept thinking i would spot a porn star in the cast somewhere.   this movies scary alright, if this is the future of big budget horror then the horror genre is doomed.",0
"tcm is keeping me awake all the time... they keep coming up with films ive never heard of ... senso.... now ossessione... a very early film by visconti!!... wow... the italian version of the postman always rings twice...brilliant!! beautifully acted and directed ...never heard of either leads who were excellent, clara calamai,as giovanna, and especially, massimo girotti as gino... what a sensual man !! more muscular and attractive than anyone else on the screen in 1943!!! his look was ahead of its time...many male stars from the 1950s were probably inspired by him... he should have been a major world wide star!! the film is much better than the jack nicholson/jessica lange version and less glossier than the mgm version (which i really like) with john garfield and lana turner remember that white outfit ? who can forget.... this italian version is different ..more realistic and with a very different ending... see it watch it...im going to buy it !!",1
"in this day and age of incredible special movie effects, this one was a sore disappointment. the actors seemed stiff and uninspired, as was the dialogue. westerns are not common fare for hollywood so much these days, but movies like ""silverado"" prove that somebody out there still knows how to make a good one. considering that, it is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing, much less creating such a weak film as this one. if you love and are looking for a good western, keep looking!",0
"often laugh out loud funny play on sex, family, and the classes in beverly hills milks more laughs out of the zip code than it's seen since the days of granny and jed clampett. plot centers on two chauffers who've bet on which one of them can bed his employer (both single or soon to be single ladies, quite sexy -- bisset and woronov) first. if manuel wins, his friend will pay off his debt to a violent asian street gang -- if he loses, he must play bottom man to his friend!   lots of raunchy dialogue, fairly sick physical humour, etc. but a lot of the comedy is just beneath the surface. bartel is memorable as a very sensual oder member of the family who ends up taking his sexy, teenaged niece on a year long ""missionary trip"" to africa.  hilarious fun.",1

"i got this dvd well over 2 years ago and only decided to watch it yesterday. i don't know why it took me so long as i do like the inspector gadget show and even the new gadget and the gadgetinis. while it may have a bright color pallet and all the technical sophistication of a modern animated movie, there are some old things missing that bog this gadget right down the toilet.  first of all the classic inspector gadget theme song and music is completely absent. the composer tries to compromise by doing a score that sounds similar but it's still just no good enough. the gadget-mobile is now a talking car, not a car that can turn into a van. plus it looks a lot cuter and rounder instead of being plain cool. penny no longer has her computer book and she and brain hardly make an appearance at all.  the plot is non-existent. there's something about a transformation formula and doctor claw using for some never revealed evil but that's all i got. what the deal was with the short/giant italian guy i will never know. it had nothing to do with anything.  and if the title is anything to go by, his last case is wrapped up in no way whatsoever. and he stays on the force so why it's called 'last case' is a mystery also.  i wasn't impressed at all. this is an affront to a great animated show that is strangely absent on dvd, but don't let that prompt you into buying whatever inspector gadget dvds you can. i sold this mere seconds after finally watching it. no kid will like or appreciate this and no fan of the old show with tolerate it.",0
"i will never forget the wit and great comedy of the original vacation movie! the lines, pacing, and timing of events in that film are outstanding! however, this european vacation sequel is a major let down.  in this sequel, the griswalds win a european vacation on a game show. the problem is that many of the jokes in the film are little more than mild, ""ha-ha"" laughs. for example, a flight attendant on an airplane asks clark, ""do you want your coke in the can?"" clark answers back, ""no, i'll have it right here."" that's really about the only line that is funny in this film.  european vacation's humor is strained. as if the writers borrowed all the jokes from the first movie, tried to re-hash a script that had been done before, and relied on a ridiculous slap-stick chase scene sequence toward the end of the picture just to kill time.  worse, the natural comic standouts like randy quaid as cousin eddie and the original kids who played rusty and audrey from the first movie so well are nowhere to be found. their replacements are not funny, can't act, and just look like they are going through the motions most of the time. there are also a few crude sex jokes and comments that are not only not funny, they are in bad taste.  the griswald's should have stayed in wally world. the place that made them legends! don't join them on this european dreadful adventure. viewers should re-watch the original vacation movie in place of this! you'll be glad you did.",0
"below average movie with poor music considering a movie based on music??? ordinary script & direction with full of blunders. salman khan was at his usual acting. ajay's performance deteriorating with time as his looks,especially his styles as a rock star were pathetic. asin was just a showpiece only. overall i felt like wasting my money in cinema. salman khan remains as immature as 10 years ago compared to aamir khan. there were many songs in the movie all boring except ""man ko ati"". the most important song to impress the uk music sponsor was most unimpressive. ""khanabadosh"" can be very easily understood by an english music sponsor. the other movie i saw last week was ""wake up sid"" which was simple slow love story with good direction & acting despite average music",0

"i didn't really go into ""reign over me"" knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story. the plot was easy enough to understand, i suppose. this guy's whole family died in 9/11, and he shuts the world out of his life. alright. i didn't know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it, and it really doesn't on a very obvious level, so if you're scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours, i wouldn't worry about it. i think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention ""september the eleventh"".  overall, i was impressed. it was a very moving picture. the movie has a sense of humor, and it is very sharp, but it is definitely a drama where it counts. i typically don't like to think that comedic actors are incapable of actually acting, but sometimes, let's be honest, they are. adam sandler is definitely capable of it (and though i think so, you may disagree, jim carrey is also very well-rounded.. sometimes). sandler's portrayal of charlie fineman took a character that on the surface seems completely unreal and makes it become absolutely believable. i read many reviews that criticized the writing of alan johnson's (don cheadle in another excellent role, if not one that seems similar to a few of his more recent pictures)wife, who is played well by jada pinkett smith, calling her static and dull, but that is completely untrue.  she has depth, but some of it gets hidden behind the main story, which does drift in and out of focus occasionally. (which also brings to mind some very unusual transitions done early in the movie, with a weird ""make everything out of focus"" fadeout. after about the first 40 minutes, they aren't used anymore. maybe it's significant for the characters outlook, artistically, or maybe they just realized how irritating it was.) the film gradually begins to reveal to us the point (one of several, but definitely the most explicit) of the story, which is that sometimes people have to deal with grief in their own way. maybe it seems unorthodox to us, maybe it seems downright unhealthy, but maybe what some people want more than anything is just to forget. to just exist. the films soundtrack was excellent, and it used music to pursue and amplify moods, rather than establish them, which gives credit to the actors and the writers.  the movie takes it's name from the song ""love, reign o'er me"", off of the who's rock opera, quadrophenia. the song itself is fairly insignificant to the actual story, but it is used powerfully in the movie over the course of the climax, and at the very end. the movie is paced well, and does not feel like it's dragging anywhere in it's length, which is a little over 2 hours. if you can accept adam sandler's portrayal of this deeply heartbroken and broken down man, you will enjoy the movie. you will become entangled in the story, and you will genuinely feel for the characters in every minute of it. it is not the best movie of the year, and there's nothing groundbreaking or positively amazing in it, but it's a very enjoyable, watchable movie, all in all.",1
"it was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh, innovative, and original show. this makes every show i've ever watched look plain boring. the moment the first episode aired i was entranced and i became attached to all the characters so easy (which usually never happens because i always hate a few characters). it is a pity this show won't have a third season, because it has to be one of the best shows i have ever seen and that isn't exaggerating my feelings for the show at all. nothing can ever replace pushing daisies, because what could abc possibly find to replace this show? this is easily the best show on television.   i came for kristin chenoweth and i stayed because i fell in love with the entire show.",1
"""in cold blood"", adapted by director richard brooks from truman capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. the film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man perry smith (robert blake).  the cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. robert blake and scott wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. they play off of each other effortlessly while blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. the rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on.  richard brooks received oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. in my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. the oscar-nominated cinematography by conrad hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. also worthy of note is the jazzy score by quincy jones which secured the last of the film's four oscar nominations.  unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual hollywood approach. i recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.",1
"this film was on last week and although at that time of the day (around 6pm) the quality of the movies is almost never good (at least here on mexican tv), i couldn't switch the tv off. the story about madelene moore really touches you. she doesn't come across as a very sympathetic character at first, but seeing the whole film, you just want her so succeed. this film really leaves you thinking. and i think that basically due to the great acting of brooke johnson. i had never heard of her before nor knowingly seen her in another film, but this was great great acting. compliments to brooke. i hope to see her in another film soon.",1
"kabei: our mother (2008) is a poetic and sublime beauty from japan. a real weeper! i had heard great reviews for the film and rented it from netflix. am i glad i did! in many ways this film reminded me of the old style of japanese classic film-making from the 1940's and 1950's that i've come to love so much, such as seen in yasujiro ozu pictures -- the title credits even begin in the same way, with the japanese letters (characters) in red against neutral color burlap material. i immediately thought: this director loves ozu. the same style was used too: mostly indoor sets with only a few outdoor scenes. even a couple of ""pillow shots"", as roger ebert calls them. the strength of the film is built on the love of the characters for one another.  the story follows the lives of a japanese family before, and during, and after, world war two. the mother takes care of her growing girls the best she can after the father (a university professor) is arrested for anti-war sympathies. he's never freed and only has a few brief meetings with his wife in prison before he dies of starvation and disease. meanwhile a former student of the professor comes by often to help take care of the mother and two girls. he begins to fall in love with the mother and is a substitute father for the two girls. but war starts and he's drafted and they have to say an abrupt farewell. will they ever express their love for one another? will he ever return from the war?   there is so much heart and gentle spirit in the performance of the lead actress, sayuri yoshinaga. she's almost a madonna type, she's so beautiful! big soulful eyes and flawless skin. the actor who plays the student is phenomenal as well: his name is tadanobu asano. what a sensitive performance. there is no macho in him at all; he's gentle and kind. i'd certainly love to see both of these two in other movies. i think i'll check to see what's available for them. the two little child actresses are wonderful too.  the film is just released on ntsc dvd for american audiences, with very easy to read english subtitles. i gave it a 10 out of 10 on the imdb. i cried almost as much as with the japanese film classic twenty-four eyes (1954). don't miss this film!",1
"once again, i was browsing through the discount video bin and picked up this movie for $4.88. fifty-percent of the time the movies i find in the bin are pure crap (i mean horrible beyond belief) but half the time they turn out to be surprisingly good. this movie is much better than i expected. i found it very engaging, though it was obviously made by an amateur.   the direction is nothing special, but the story is intriguing with some good thrills. i expected it to be more of a comedy, but i wasn't too disappointed.   for a thriller, this movie is surprisingly good-natured. there's no bloody violence, no profanity, no nudity, no sex. usually, these movies require all four of those elements. the pg rating is well-deserved--not like ""sixteen candles"" where the ""f"" word is used twice and there's a brief gratuitous nude scene.   i just wish the romance between corey haim and his love interest could've been developed more. the film does tend to be plot-heavy, and the potentially good subplots are pushed off to the side. instead of developing a chemistry between the two of them, we end up watching a careless three-minute montage of them on their romantic endeavors. they end up kissing at the end, but there's so little chemistry that it seems forced.  ""the dream machine"" is no gem, but it's good, clean entertainment. it's quite forgettable--especially with a cast of unknowns, except for haim--but it's also much better than you'd expect.   my score: 7 (out of 10)",1
"aardman does it again. next to pixar, aardman animation proves again and again how to do animation properly.  i had a great time watching the first episode of creature comforts. i thought it translated well for american audiences. my only concern is that most of the audiences aren't going to get the subtle humor in this show.  having been a fan of the bbc version and the short film, i knew what i was in for when i sat down to watch this. the animators did a great job matching up pre-recorded voices to a perfect match animal. look at the first episode with the goat, who sounds stoned, and the dogs on the street that keep calling each other ""dawg"".  is this for everyone? not by a long shot. in fact, i'd be happy to see the show last for a full season. but like i said before, audiences aren't going to get it.",1

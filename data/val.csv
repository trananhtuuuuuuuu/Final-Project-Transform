"first of all there wasn't really anything in this movie that grabbed me really. it wasn't a bad movie, just another movie where i said ""well, that wasn't anything special"" after i'd seen it. there was probably drama and stuff, but it simply didn't grab me, but more seamed semi-dull. as i said in the headline it seamed very cheap in a way. the quality of the film itself (the images) seamed like a low quality and reminded me more of some cheap made for tv-movie than a well respected english film-maker. the camera angles and shots were very amateur like in my opinion. didn't really have any close up shots or similar effects to produce interesting scenes. i haven't seen many english films and the ones i've seen didn't really impress me more than this and they seamed kind of similar done with the camera work, colors and such. ""game"" tried to be more cool, hip & smart (see my review of ""lola rennt"" about this if you wish), but didn't succeed for me either. overall just a little indifferent movie that wasn't anything special (at best, i'm afraid) and basically unfortunately over two hours wasted.",0
"highly recommended!!  a well written, funny film which will appeal to everyone out there with a sense of humour!!!. give it a go, it's good to see an independent british movie more than holding it's own against the big established studios!! definitely worth adding to any film collection. there are scenes in this film that i'm sure a lot of people will be able to relate to. you will laugh out loud at the antics and enjoy the great soundtrack. i especially enjoyed the orb's version of jimmy cliff's vietnam and the tower of london's take on freebird.   go on give it a go............ you won't be disappointed.",1
"some spoilers if you are a big horror movie fan, then you will know that halloween paved the way for many slasher films. often imitated, never duplicated, this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made, if not the scariest.  i actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series (don't ask me why). i honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one, that's just how it worked out. but i would have to say this one blows all the others away. it is genuinely frightening, and seeing michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine. my favorite part of the movie was when michael stabs a guy, and leans his head to one side. it is one of the eeriest images in movie history.  later slashers, such as the friday the 13th films, were more fun and less intense than this movie. i do like the f13 series better than the halloween series, but this movie alone is better than all the f13 movies. michael myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic, you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people. i admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nights.  what's great about this movie is that it doesn't rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience. it is just pure terror. it's too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one, because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come.",1
"""gespenster"" question of to be cool in the german cinema  there are not many german films in the last ten years, who have made me so interest. yes, the problem of the most german films are in this film ""gespenster"" too. he is on some places to uncooked to be good to see. special the figure of toni (sabine timento) is too cool. but thats is in german films always so. everybody must to learns this coolneß - is the realism in this films. thats difficult to understand. but in this case it makes some sense, because she steals and she lies - she is the kind of girl is better you never love it, because you lose it. thats not clear for the other girl nina in this film. she love her - and she would lose her. but nina lost everything. she will play with soft emotion and a sad feeling. there is no way - but you must take it said herbert achterbusch for twenty years. thats so often the way it goes in german films. why? nina (julia hummer) is not inside of the laws of society - the is outside - and there she have no chance. this films tries not on every place to gave her a part inside. thats one of the problems - the stupid break with conventions - the criminal fascination. throw it all away - and go nowhere! but the actress plays this difficult part very interesting. on the other side - there the parents - who are the pendant to the two girls. the have a car - a hotel suite - the have money and live in world with music of the opera. but the film stand always in some distance to seem. there is no much explaining of them.  in the center of this film, there is one scene you will never forget. the two girls got to a casting. and there they should say how they find together. in this scene toni will lying on. she said a fantastic story-has nothing to do with her. and then nina will say the truth. she said it in an introversion way. there is no exhibition in it. she looks to the bottom and said what will happened for here. thats a great moment. in the next scene on the party with pictures in red this feeling is going on- than toni goes away...  okay, the film will end - in the german way of coolneß - rubbish - here the circle of sadness is closing. but there was a moment - where is happening something else - and this moment was important. he is more than german coolneß - and this moments are rare in the german cinema in this time!",1
"wow! so much fun! probably a bit much for normal american kids, and really it's a stretch to call this a kid's film, this movie reminded me a quite a bit of time bandits - very terry gilliam all the way through. while the overall narrative is pretty much straight forward, miike still throws in a lot of surreal and bunuel-esquire moments. the whole first act violently juxtaposes from scene to scene the normal family life of the main kid/hero, with the spirit world and the evil than is ensuing therein. and while the ending does have a bit of an ambiguous aspect that are common of miike's work, the layers of meaning and metaphor, particularly the anti-war / anti-revenge message of human folly, is pretty damn poignant. as manic and imaginatively fun as other great miike films, only instead of over the top torture and gore, he gives us an endless amount of monsters and yokai from japanese folk-lore creatively conceived via cg and puppetry wrapped into an imaginative multi-faceted adventure. f'n rad, and one of miike's best!",1
"in what appears an attempt to mix drama and comedy, manuel gomez pereira made this film, 'things that make life worthwhile. ""it is not an original discovery, by many voice you have (quite off the pitch, by the way), but it departs somewhat from the norm in the spanish cinema. the downside is that the elements forming the film are poorly combined, and while some points are not well developed, others are out of place. a day in the lives of two people close to the median age. it's basically what the movie gómez pereira. jorge (eduard fernandez) is a stationary (parado) one which, despite load on your back with a drama major, seems willing to see things change. only this explains his commitment to a minor could mean a turning point in its existence. in line with audrey tautou of 'long dating' (jean-pierre jeunet, 2004), jorge says things like this to herself: ""if i find a coin before the corner that is now going to change my luck. "" of course it finds it, begins to play 'today could be a great day' (hoy puede ser un gran dia)by joan manuel serrat and in a few crosses on its way hortensia (ana belen).she is another woman entry age, divorced and a little lonely. take valeriana for sleeping, organizes birthday parties as an exemplary mother, said her belief in god and leads to a speed of homicidal mother. hortensia is a woman of many contradictions in his behavior, life was going in his head driving data as ""70% of people fall in love only once in a lifetime"" and said although it is short of jorge and unemployed and does not preclude the possibility that it is a ""sadistic"" sleeping in his shoulder in the cinema at the earliest opportunity. later came a communion, a dance in the luxurious wedding banquet, the back of a car and other things that players seem to live unique experiences like that but end up doing quite heavy for the viewer. 'things that make life worthwhile' debate between us is the drama of two adult persons who have no other that leads them to see where their strange relationship and, conversely, make us take the case as a comedy, focusing on things like a chinese singing at a wedding (which seem to be amusing in itself) or the gait of a drunk person. the problem is that it does not leave us time to connect with the players, therefore we can not identify with the dramatic, and not give us a solid base comic too, leaving everything except pure joke. in the end, all mixed in a way that the viewer no longer know very well whether to laugh or mourn, and ends up not doing either. and it is true that something is not seen a thousand times, is not the kind of film that we find to bend every corner, but it is not sufficiently different or special as we want to do. ana belén (which apparently far less than the 53 years that has in this film) and eduard fernandez are two actors who are very enjoyable to see working, but this time it seems ready or comfortable enough in scenes that require him to break the calm that prevails in the film, so in moments like the ""accident"" with the children of the bar thing seems to be slipping from their hands. perhaps a very dramatic change that has to do, but that is no excuse to lower our guard. in any case, both interpreters are erected easily the highlight of the function. 'things that make life worthwhile' work only up to the modest level of entertainment. any claim that is beyond that point has not been fulfilled, as a romantic comedy or dramatic as that, we presume, they wanted to do, can not afford to have little moments finished successful (beyond bad) as that in which one of the characters talk and laugh, lost drunk, compared to a boy who remains in a coma in part because of him. neither do much for people like rosario pardo, making the typical friend launched whose biggest contribution to the film is the phrase ""must be screwed over,"" and songs from the soundtrack, though significant, not just fit. it is true that the film by manuel gomez pereira has its hits (some of the moments involving jose sacristan), but the whole is a anodyne story, a film with good intentions and a nice result when the better.",1
"that is quite an outdated movie which aims to showcase the youth's yearning for freedom in some dehumanizing british school. oh yes it's like in the army, you learn to obey and do what you're asked to. yes the young dream of something else but it breaks their dreams and sweeps away their optimism on the threshold of life. great.  basically that's how you could sum up the nice intentions in if... nice intentions that arouses no cinematographic challenges: the result is a declamatory movie. do you see how boring i mean?  at least that oldie helped kubrick cast mcdowell in a clockwork orange, a movie with a truly powerful social satire and no self-indulgent sentimentalism.",0
"just finished watching the movie and wanted to give my own opinion(and justice) to the movie.  first of all, to get things straight, this movie is not pretending to be anything other than a solid action comedy movie. it doesn't aim to revolutionize the movie industry and garner critical acclaims nor does it want to be regarded as one. if you really want to enjoy this movie to the fullest, i suggest you discard your critical-mindedness and your longing for a good plot because you won't find any in here. with that established, let us further into the movie.  i had low expectations for this movie simply because it didn't have a strong plot(yes, moviegoers, i underrated this movie as well), but i never expected myself to enjoy this movie that much. i even enjoyed this more than the stephen chow flicks(which i find kung fu hustle to be his best effort and would've rated it a 9 as well). action is tight and epic while comedy chokes on to the right places.  spoilers alert, i think the action might be unreal, but why would i want to watch a serious basketball movie anyways? there are a lot other sports movies(drama) that already did it well, why create another? spoilers end  i'm not even sure why you're reading this. go ahead and watch it. just remember, no thinking - just watch, enjoy, smile, laugh, and   every once in a while they(the movie industry) creates masterpieces such as pulp fiction or the godfather movies, and sometimes they create movies which are better off in the pile of dump. i'm not saying kung fu dunk deserves the recognition that the previous examples have, then again, if we're talking about stephen chow-ish comedy, this one's a top ten.  highly recommended if you love: -no brainer movies with really good action -kung fu -death trance -kung fu and comedy -what the heck, watch this. you'll have a great time.  9/10 for you the cast of kung fu dunk. ^_^",1
"this movie is bad news and i'm really surprised at the level of big name talent who would ever agree to appear in such a piece of junk as this. i imagine there were a few strangled agents sprawled across hollywood blvd. as a result of this fiasco. what really gets you is that it could have been good. the directors star appeal and the subject matter was sufficient fodder to spark interest and ticket sales, but this is a flop. the multiple story lines all go from bad to silly by the pictures end, and you end up feeling like a mouse in a maze looking for a piece of cheese that turns out to be rotten. what spike is able to achieve is revenge against any italians who may have beat him up when he was a kid or insulted him, as the movie does quite a number on perpetuating outdated and probably offensive italian stereotypes. as with any spike lee film there is some really thought provoking and magical camerawork. he does have the gift of grabbing your psyche and transporting you into his vision if only for a few memorable scenes. but the question remains...can you endure the other 2 hours of head scratching and clock watching as you wonder and wait for the ending that has to be there somewhere.",0
whack!!! i got this movie because elizabeth hartman was in it. i was disappointed to find out she was in like two short scenes towards the end. other than that i was basically hitting the fast forward button the entire time. some teenager goes on a trip to romania with his dad and gets bitten by a wolf and turns into a werewolf if there's a full moon. he kills his father and friends. about 30 years past but he doesn't age a bit and enrolls in a high school. there he meets a shy teacher whom he ends up biting and then has kids with her. this movie sucked and i don't recommend it to anyone. read war and peace instead. only ms. hartman did a great job. check out a very young bob saget in this one!!,0
"when i go to see movies i would stay up and watch it or if i did not like it, i would go sleep, but this was pure crap, i actually got up and walked out!....this was poorly script and put together, i hated it. also, they should not have taken brendan frasier off, he was much better. this was not as good as i had expected, considering that i really liked george of the jungle 1, and the graphics weren't as good as the first one, for instance, the bird, and when ever he crashed in a tree. i hope that the director of this takes heed, and next movies he make, he needs to reconsider...horrible! i really would like to give ursla a job well done, as she made the movie worthwhile (until i walked out)...overall i give this movie a 2 out of 10",0
"this is even worse than the original game of death. a jumbled, incoherent storyline leads to ""billy lo"" falling from a helicopter to the ground below, killing him, as we're left to follow his younger brother, bobby lo. so not only do we start out following some bruce lee clone, the film kills that one off and has us follow another one thirty minutes into the story. the main reason to watch this one is when bobby lo fights a lion, which is quite obviously a guy in a lion costume. jang lee hwang is also the villain, who is usually pretty awesome but his screen time is significantly small. mainly watched this and the original game of death because they're a part of the bruce lee boxed set. it's no wonder they're included with lee's finished works. no one would buy them otherwise.",0
"this movie is not good.the first one almost sucked,but had that unreal ending to make it worth watching.this one has nothing.there's zero scare,zero tension or suspense.this isn't really a horror movie.most of the kills don't show anything.there's no gore to speak of.this could almost be a tv,except for a bit of nudity and a bit of violence.the acting is not very good,either.and don't get me started on the dialogue.as for the surprise ending,surprise,there isn't one.i suppose it could have been worse,although i don't see how.but then again,it is less than 80 minutes long,so i guess that's a good thing.although it felt a lot longer. apparently this is the cut version of the film.i found it for a very cheap price,but it still not worth it.if you want the uncut more graphic version,check out the anchor bay edition.anyway,this version of sleepaway camp ii:unhappy campers gets a big fat 1/10 from me. p.s.if you watch this movie,you will probably be a bored and unhappy camper.if you are a real fan,you might want to pick up anchor bay's sleepaway camp(with survival kit) three disc collection containing the first three movies uncut and with special features",0
"""fever pitch"" is a sweet and charming addition to the small genre of sports romances as date movies or movies a son could be willing to go to with his mother (though the guys in the audience got noticeably restless during the romantic scenes).  i have lived through a milder version of such a story, as my first exposure to baseball was dating my husband the spring after the mets first world series win and then i watched the mets clinch their next one because i was the one still up in the wee hours with our two little sons, who have grown up to teach me more about baseball through our local neighborhood national league team's other heartbreaking failures to win it again (and it was me who took our older son to his only fenway park game as i caught a bit of red sox fever as a graduate student in boston).  so compared to reality, the script believably creates two people with actual jobs. it is particularly impressive that drew barrymore's character is a substantive workaholic who has anti-barbie skills, though she pretty much only visits with her three bland girlfriends during gym workouts that allow for much jiggling and the minor side stories with her parents don't completely work.  it is even set up credibly how she meets jimmy fallon's math teacher and how she falls for his ""winter guy"" -- though it's surprising that his red sox paraphernalia filled apartment didn't tip her off to his jekyll-and-hyde ""summer guy."" their relationship crisis during the baseball season is also played out in a refreshingly grown-up way, from efforts at compromise to her frank challenges to him, centered around that they are both facing thirty and single. fallon surprisingly rises to his character's gradual emotional maturity.  while the ending borrows heavily from o. henry, the script writers did a yeoman job of quickly incorporating the sox's incredible 2004 season into a revised story line (with lots of cooperation from the red sox organization for filming at the stadium).  the script goes out of its way to explain why fallon doesn't have a boston accent, as an immigrant from new jersey, but that doesn't explain why his motley friends don't. the most authentic sounding boston sounds come from most of his ""summer family"" of other season ticket holders, who kindly kibitz the basics of sox lore to neophyte barrymore (and any such audience members).  the song selection includes many red sox fans' favorites, from the opening notes of the classic ""dirty water,"" though most are held to be heard over the closing credits as if you are listening to local radio and are worth sitting through to hear.",1
zero day is based of columbine high school massacre. and its a video diary of two boys. at first you don't know whats going to happen you think it is just a bad student film. until they start talking about the horrible things they are going to do in this quite school. until they start talking about pipe bombs and guns and going shooting in the woods. they is a lot to say about this movie. all know this film is well a film you forget you watching a film and watching a real video two boys made.  the two boys act like they are in a weird cult. they burn all there stuff. like play station games books dvds homework stuff school stuff. these two boys can be anybody your friends you brothers or the people you see walking down the street. it goes through there daily actives (and that is making a gun. in the videos they make it mentions the bullying that happens to them and how people said stuff about there clothes and the things you are into i'm not saying its right but many people do do things like that.  and also the thing is with this people are suspected to like it because of the sensitive topic they have chosen on this film.  so thats my review on zero day.  and lets just say the end shooting scene is messed up.,1
"this show is about three little girls. (d.j, stephanie, and michelle) their mother is killed by a drunk driver so their father danny invites his brother-in-law (jesse) and his old friend(joey). so the whole show is about living life. the girls go through life's troubles and have life lessons. they develop crushes, boyfriends, and many more. the whole show is basically about to go with the flow. you do not have to hold grudges you just have to let it go. i think this show is really good and fun to watch. i grew up watching this show and still watch it today. i am glad they still air this show on television. i watch it almost every day. i rate it 10/10.",1

"anyone who could find redeeming value in this piece of crap ought to have their head examined. we have the submissive, heroin-addicted, part-time hooker wife with lacerations all over her body, lacerations received from repeated beatings by an abusive son. now, she is squirting breast milk all over the kitchen floor, the release so gained somehow akin to helen keller placing her hands in running water. we have the husband who starts out by patronizing a prostitute who just happens to be his daughter (she's upset with him because he came too quickly)and ends by murdering his female colleague, having sex with her corpse, and then chopping her up. we have the kid who is relentlessly bullied by his classmates and who comes home and beats his mom. you see, it's all circular. deep, huh? the only decent moment in this horrendous pile of tripe is when the dad murders his son's tormentors. it's a good thing this turkey was shot on video because otherwise what a waste of expensive film it would be. if that guy who thinks artists ought to be interested in this slop is really serious, no wonder most people think artists are insane. we saw this lousy movie, then put on ""zero woman, the accused."" oh my god, it was a tossup as to which one was worse. what is going on in japan these days? sick, sick, sick.",0
"first of all, jenna jameson is the best actress in this movie, and she's just awful. this movie has every horror move cliché in imagination, and all badly played. the over-sexed teen couple. the comical(not)horny jock. the snotty cool chick. the creepy local color guy. the parental-type couple. the virginal chick who amazingly never dies in these films. the dialogue is so painfully awful and delivered with the depth of a wading pool. it's almost like you're wishing that they'd all die sooner. i saw the rough cut of this film a while ago, but somehow, this just got worse. sure, the funniest thing in here is the ghoul trying to eat jameson's implants, but that hardly rates even a rental of this dog. avoid at all costs.",0
"sure, he became rapidly uneven after this film, but from ""knife in the water"" up till ""the tenant"", roman polanski could always be counted on to deliver something fascinating and unique. despite many running themes (alienation, paranoia), no two of his films are really alike. the story of this is somewhat similar to his own ""repulsion"" from ten years earlier, but the tone is completely different. ""the tenant"" manages to balance darker than dark absurdity (i'm a bit hesitant on calling it humor, even though the protagonists bizarre behavior and dialog was occasionally funny) with some truly suspenseful paranoia. polanski was always a master at building unease, and moments in this film are almost unbearably creepy. the overall weirdness of the film is also a plus.  in addition to polanski's exquisite as usual direction, the rest of the cast and crew offer great contributions. polanski the actor is often overshadowed by polanski the director, but his performance here truly captures his characters awkwardness and sense of being an outcast. the themes of social discrimination make this film more than just strangeness for the sake of being strange. the rest of the cast offers strong performances also, especially isabelle adjani's sympathetic turn, and melyvn douglas and shelley winters' appropriately annoying ones. ""the tenant"" is often underrated because of how ready people are to heap praise on both ""repulsion"" and ""rosemary's baby"", but its just as brilliant as either of those classics. (9/10)",1
"i was surprised when i saw this film. i'd heard it was the best ever filmed of the novel. how disappointed i was.  how any true jane austen fan can rate this adaptation is a mystery to my eyes. the scriptwriters have decided to stick in bits of ridiculous humour which are embarrassing at the best of times, but also ruin the feel of the period. as for the cast: gwyneth paltrow makes a rather shallow heroine (but then any 'hot' american star would be questionable in the role), toni collette is miscast, and poor ewan mcgregor is made to look laughable!  i really could not say a good thing about this film. i seem to be among the very few who don't rate it, but if you want my advice, see instead the tv production starring kate beckinsale - believe me, that is far preferable to this superficial trash.",0

"eight simple rules started as a very entertaining series. i love john ritter and his character paul hennessey and the relationship he had with his children was the best part of the show.  i have always preferred kerry to bridget, bridget has been done before, kerry is quite unique and i can relate to her in many ways, although i'm not sure i like the direction her character went in later series.  early episodes were fun, good simple teenage plots about paul and cate disciplining the kids, however i think the show lost it's sparkle when john ritter died. i admired the cast and crew for wishing to continue the series but when he died, i felt the programme did to. to me the whole point of the show was based around the guide of the '8 simple rules of dating my teenage daughter' it was written by a real man with teenage daughters and the relevance and the angle of the show had changed without the hennessey dad.  bridget seemed to get more annoying, rory stayed the same and cate was always giving her offspring life's lessons which before seemed funnier when it was all left to paul. i think the granddad is funny (especially when he's watching great escape) but feel c.j is unnecessary to the show. he is funny in parts but i felt the story lines at the time of his arrival were very similar to other american comedy series. over all the newer ones aren't bad just missing excitement and does anyone else find it irritating that cate works at the school and c.j and granddad's always there too? i would always recommend this show to friends as it was very strong at the beginning and well worth watching for paul and kerry, but later ones were about average at best.",1
"might contain possible spoilers (not that anything in this film is new or will even mildly surprise you for that matter)  why does disney feel the need to recycle everything they ever made into oblivion? sure it's cheaper for them, but after a while, wouldn't you think there overall quality and the way people think of them would drop off. house of villains is a despicable display of cartoon crossovers that make absolutely no sense at all. some signs of the total disregard for previous films in this are: the voices don't even remotely match up and iago is evil again (since when?!) i know that these films are directly towards children but there was a time when all could enjoy disney films. even the movie's musical number (which had been disney's specialty for years) stunk. i wouldn't recommend this film to anyone even the very young. all i can is that if more of these movies of the same caliber are released, it's only a matter of time before some small animation studio surpasses disney in overall quality.",0
"some people think that the second series was where scooby was ruined..i disagree totally.the shows quality did not go up or down and scrappy ,win my opinion,as a very good chrecter.i looked at a poll on jumpedtheshark.com and 72% of people said scrappys second series was scoobys downfall.ok so loads said yes but 28%still cant be wrong.i do like the way most of the episodes focused on comedy.i believe the show would have gone rubbish if it was the same 5 people/dog solving mystery in same formula.scrappy was a breath of fresh air to the show.sure,some people tuned out but when scrappy was introduced viewing figures doubled.back to the show.all the episodes and segments were very funny.i was intriguded by the yabba shorts and .but at the end of the day its a matter of opinion if you like scrappy or not is a matter of opinion,there is certainly no fact involved.but in my opinion this was a superb series that gave a beginning to tire show a new formula and lease of life.nuff said.",1
"""rock 'n' roll high school"" will probably have to go down in history as the ultimate rebellious party flick. portraying a bunch of high school students using the ramones' music as inspiration to rise up against their despotic principal (mary woronov, of ""eating raoul"" fame), the whole movie is a mile a minute. it's basically a big excuse to have fun, and i'm sure that you will. bullied freshmen? check. a dorky music teacher (paul bartel, also from ""eating raoul""*)? check. exploding mice? checkmate.  anyway, this is the sort of stuff that makes life worth living. even for someone like me who doesn't know the ramones' music, it's pure pleasure. with roger corman executive producing and joe dante co-directing, how could we expect anything less? too bad that director allan arkush later degenerated into fare such as ""caddyshack ii"".  also starring p.j. soles, vincent van patten, clint howard, dey young, dick miller (who has appeared in every one of joe dante's movies, and many of roger corman's), don steele, and of course the ramones. a real treat.  *it seems like bartel and woronov always co-starred. they also co-starred in joe dante's ""hollywood boulevard"" and the slasher flick ""chopping mall"" (also starring dick miller)...in which they reprised their roles from ""eating raoul"".",1

"the united states was still fighting world war ii (the movie was released in between ve day and vj day). any studio worth its salt was either making fighting movies where fearless american soldiers beat the enemy, or americans in general were singing and dancing. technicolor musicals were what america thrived on in the depressing days when everything was rationed. most musicals of the day were simply a bunch of musical numbers strung together with the best available plot slipped in to fill time til the next musical number! i get the feeling now that the people reviewing this movie were all born after 1970. depressing how quickly we forget.  this film could've been called ""the search for jose iturbi"" but now everyone wonders why. allow me to explain. from 1929--his arrival in america--until his death in 1980, iturbi was one of the finest pianists to grace a concert stage. he agreed to do a few movies in 1942, but hollywood had been after him for nearly a decade at that time. not only an excellent pianist, but a successful conductor as well, iturbi was very much a household word for more than 40 years.   the scene where iturbi and 17 other pianists play one of liszt's rhapsodies was planned early on--and hasn't anyone ever noticed the other pianists were all children? joe pasternak, who produced that movie & many other mgm musicals, credited iturbi with interesting america's youth in classical music. grayson's wanting an audition with iturbi in the movie was not unlike real life at the time. everyone wanted iturbi back then. the joke among soldiers was that ""gi"" meant ""get iturbi"" (he did a lot of concerts at military bases).  gene kelly was a great dancer and frank sinatra an excellent singer, but at the time this movie was made sinatra was barely 30 and had only been under contract to columbia records for four years. kelly was already well-known as a dancer, but iturbi had by then been a world-wide sensation for 20+ years.  and as to the lack of a plot, americans didn't need plot. they were tired of war, they were sick with fear for their loved ones, and worried about the future. they needed happiness and hope and the assurance that things would work out fine in the end. they needed music and smiles and joy and romance. this movie and others like it delivered just what was needed.  enough lecturing. mouse dancing aside, the best scene in the movie occurs between sinatra and iturbi with each of them ""ignorantly"" complimenting the other's music.  if you have any interest in jose iturbi, the spaniard who conquered more of america than de soto, cortez, and de leon put together, please drop by my website, www.joseiturbi.com, where you can find a plot summary, excerpts from movie reviews ""of the day"" and pictures from this and certain other mgm musicals of the 1940's, as well as a biography and discography of iturbi.  trout",1

"the combination of the superb black and white photography and the 'eugene onegin with a twist' plot made this a real knock out for me. the atmosphere created by the mostly very dark shots contrasted with occasional very bright overexposed white was gripping. there was a superb moment where where transparencies - apparently conventional holiday snaps but where the faces of the actors revealed character and situation subtly but instantly - were shown accompanied by lensky's heart-wrenching aria from the tschaikowsky opera eugene onegin.  for me the mark of a good film is that it should take advantage of the opportunities presented by that medium, which means that often the story is less important than imagery and atmosphere - last year in marienbad is a good example of such a film. krisana is in the same mould.",1

"more tv movies ought to be made like this one. i saw it way back in '93 when it was first on tv. helen hunt and steven weber were both terrific, giving very gritty and realistic performances. weber was especially good, turning in an exceptionally creepy and understated performance as the child molester/killer. this film really increased my respect for hunt as an actress. the director also directed ""hoosiers,"" which was somehow both formulaic and exciting. but the direction in both of these works has the same stark, simple realism that is so appealing. if you like tv movies that aren't predictable and filled with overacting, see it if you can. the side story about hunt and fahey's affair is also appealing without detracting from the main story.",1
"i really wanted to like this film, but so much of it is stolen/borrowed from other work -- some of the borrowing is painfully blatant. the new york times' review pointed out that their singing frog is awfully reminiscent of the one in the famous warner brothers' cartoon ('hello my baby, hello my darlin', hello my ragtime gal...'). but i challenge anyone to watch the fox/blue sky animated feature robots (2005) and not find ridiculous similarities in: storyline - a young inventor growing up, and a single innovative corporation distributes all great inventions.  cityscape - extremely similar camera angles capture extremely similar futuristic city environments.  ...robots... - the servant robot in the robinson household has a very similar design to those in robots, and both films use a sort of retro-futuristic look.  all of this seems to be in sharp contradiction to the obnoxious quote from disney at the end, implying that the company has been a steady innovator who never looks back (which also contradicts their entire catalog of films in the 90s that were pretty much clones of each other, with some minor tweaks to storyline and ethnicity).  the filmmakers seem unable to let the story speak on its own, and instead constantly send objects and noises flying in our direction, as though we don't have the attention span for anything less.  the villain is really well-designed and brilliantly animated, and he's a pleasure to watch. much of the rest of the film seems thrown-together. some of the landscapes look like cgi from the mid-90s.  the film actually opens with a classic mickey mouse short. by the end of this cartoon, we are reminded that disney never did have much interest in innovating or good storytelling -- they seem to think that simply getting something up on the big screen is proof enough of their virtue.",0
"""white noise"" had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since ""the exorcist"" i think. seeing as evp is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact. not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people. like i said this movie could have, but did not. the movie degraded itself to a low class pg-13 scary movie. nothing compared to ""the ring"" or ""the sixth sense"" by any means. someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think, but it makes us jump, scream, everything a horror movie should do. i'm honestly sick of the pg-13 horror genre, because its becoming a genre of its own. we need the old days back, the blood and gore days, the freddy kruger, the jason, the mike myers days. few movies can pull off a think about this mentality being so not scary. so why try to pull it off? a few good jumps in this movie amount to nothing but one of the stupidest endings in movie history with no resolution at all...don't waste your money on this movie.",0
"serum starts as eddie (derek phillips) is delighted to learn he has been accepted into medical school to carry on the family tradition of becoming an md like his father richard (dennis o'neill) & his uncle eddie (david h. hickey), however his joy could be short lived as eddie is involved in an accident & is run over by a car. taken to the nearest hospital it doesn't look good for poor eddie so his uncle eddie convinces his brother richard to let him save eddie with the serum he has developed, a serum which will give the recipient the power to self heal any sort of wound or illness. desperate for his boy to live richard agrees but the procedure has unwanted side effects like turning eddie into a brain eating zombie which is just not a good thing...  executive produced, written & directed by steve franke i'll be perfectly frank myself & say serum is awful, serum is one of those no budget horror films which tries to rip-off other any number of other's & ends up being slightly more fun than having you fingernails pulled out with pliers. the script is terrible, it has the whole re-animator (1985) feel to it with mad scientists wielding huge syringes trying to eradicate death but it's so boring it's untrue, the first forty minutes is nothing more than a really dull soap opera that amounts to nothing expect to pad the running time out with eddie arriving home after spending some time away & finding his ex-girlfriend has hooked up with someone else, arguments with his step-mom, getting drunk with his mate & generally boring the audience stiff. so, once the tedium of the first forty minutes is over & if your still watching it it takes another twenty minutes to get eddie re-animated & then he kills a couple of people, police catch up with him & shoot him, the end. thank god. serum is devoid of any of the characteristic's that one would associate with a good film, the character's suck, the dialogue is poor, it takes itself far too seriously, it's dull, it's slow, it's forgettable & considering it's meant to be a horror film there's an alarming lack of blood, gore or horror. not recommended, did i mention serum was boring? i thought so.  director franke does nothing to liven this thing up, although competent there's no style here at all. the gore levels are none existent, there's a bit of splashed blood, a bitten neck, a couple of scars on a dead woman's face, a couple of scenes where a needle pierces skin & that's it. don't expect a re-animator in the gore department because if you do your going to be sorely disappointed, much like i was in fact. filmed in what looks like one house, one restaurant & a lab the film has no variety either & just looks cheap throughout. there's a couple of scenes of nudity but that's nowhere near enough to save it.  technically the film isn't too bad, at least it looks like proper cameras were used, i can't really comment on the special effects because there aren't any but generally speaking serum looks reasonably professional. apparently shot in texas, or should that read it should have literally been shot in texas? the acting sucks although again i think they were proper actor's rather than friends or family of the director.  serum is a terrible film, it's dull, slow, boring, has no gore & feels like a horrible soap opera for the first forty minutes. i don't understand why anyone would feel the need to watch this when they can watch re-animator or one of it's sequels again instead, seriously i recommend you give serum a miss. there i've just saved you from wasting 90 minutes of your life, you can thank me later.",0
"the last station, director michael hoffman's melodrama about the last months in the life of leo tolstoy, begins with fog and sleep. tolstoy (christopher plummer) lives with his family in a compound at yasnaya polyana, taking walks and writing and being seen to by his wife and the adherents to his ""movement"", people dedicated to his ideas of pacifism, vegetarianism, sexual abstinence and communal property who have gathered in a forest camp not far away. his wife, sophia (helen mirren) wars openly with the head of his movement chertkov (paul giamatti), who she claims in his efforts to convince tolstoy to sign the rights to his works over to the russian people is trying to steal the wealth that is owed to her upon her husbands imminent death. observing all of this is tolstoy's new steward, bulgakov (james mcavoy), a naive adherent who is torn between his love of the man and concern for his wife.  hoffman's script, which is based on the novel by jay parini, quite often veers itself into confused territory, building up a complex tangle of threads and opaque motivations that ultimately don't resolve themselves in any satisfying way. the scope of the film is grand, and its story should reverberate just as tolstoy, whose beliefs foreshadowed in some ways both the bolsheviks' and those of pacifists like ghandi. it unfortunately doesn't, it's un-unpickable, building up with much gusto confrontations that are constantly ravelling off into nothingness. the three-way relationship between the church, the faithful sophia and the unbelieving tolstoy, for example, is referenced often. in the last section of the film a mute priest in a magnificent hat even shows up, but the script never expands on this beyond awkwardly inserting it into the story as an attempt at enriching it or providing some semblance of historical accuracy. there are a ton of details in the film, but not enough attention is paid to most of them and as a result the film feels cluttered, overburdened, energetic but unfortunately pointless.  at its heart is the love story between sophia and tolstoy, and that story, as baffling and cramped as it is, is the reason to watch the film. mirren and plummer are, unsurprisingly, the best things in the film. plummer's tolstoy is vague, at once confused and resolute, apprehensive and full of joy and certainty. mirren's sophia is in full panic, in a righteous lather, forced to watch and expected to be mute as her husband gives away his time, his possessions and his money to people who are unquestionably devoted to him but also clearly in possession of their own agendas. they're great performances, all the more so given the vast gulf between the real importance of the couple's place in history and the script's ability to support that, both sophia and tolstoy seem willed into the film by mirren and plummer alone, both making the best they can out of what meagre material is there. giammati and mcavoy, both talented actors, are unable to do the same and giamatti's chertkov seems neither a revolutionary nor a thief (and not both at once, either) but rather a cipher, a stand-in for a whole package of unresolved anxieties and aborted historical impulses. the scope of this thing never boils down to anything, it hitches along, getting by on the strength of plummer and mirren and not much else. it's interesting and pretty, but ultimately unrewarding. 4.5/10",0
"how amazing this film is! i've seen it over and over throughout the years and i'm always spellbound by it. the reason why the film is so easy to re-watch is, of course, the arresting performance given by the young bette davis. she not only steals every scene that she's in, but is actually much prettier and better photographed here (not to mention sexier) than she was in any of the films that she had made thus far at her home studio, warner brothers (this film was made by r.k.o. radio pictures). she wears a very flattering make-up and has very attractive hairstyles and oh, those lovely big eyes (especially, in the restaurant scenes that take place in london's soho). her body was so curvy when she was young. get a load of it in the cheap negligee that she wears for her big explosive confrontation scene with leslie howard. and oh boy, she is an absolute powerhouse in that scene. howard is a little too nervous throughout, but he does captures the hero's sensitivity. frances dee scores as the sweet, pretty young sally who truly loves him. max steiner's score is both charming and poignant. splendid performances and thirties flavor make this the must see version of the classic novel.",1
the good thing about this film is that it stands alone - you don't have to have seen the original. unfortunately this is also it's biggest drawback. it would have been nice to have included a few of the original characters in the new story and seen how their lives had developed. sinclair as in the original is excellent and provides the films best comic moments as he attempts to deal with awkward and embarrassing situations but the supporting cast is not as strong as in the original movie. forsyth is to be congratulated on a brave attempt to move the character on and create an original sequel but the film is ultimately flawed and lacks the warmth of the original,1
"let me say first that this show was top tier when john ritter was there. upon his death, the show did drop off a bit, but the producers didn't give up on the show, adding james garner and david spade to the regular cast from 2003 to 2005.  the show centers around the hennessy family, paul (john ritter, may he rest in peace), his wife cate (katey sagal), their daughters bridget (kaley cuoco), kerry (amy davidson), and their son, rory (martin spanjers). when ritter was on the show, i would shriek in laughter (and proud to admit it, i am), but now that he's gone, i'll only laugh a little with the occasional hearty laugh. i'm very glad that i fell for this show's trance after ritter's untimely death, because it made the eps with ritter so much better.  ritter's character is just so well acted and well rounded, that you can't help but love him. he is always bossing the girls around about dating, but he really wants them to be happy. it's the ultimate daddy hates boyfriend entertainment.  katey sagal is great as well, and she too is a likable character. after ritter's death, her character provides such good influence and strength for not only her kids, but i believe sagal has shaped the lives of cuoco, davidson, and spanjers, because she and ritter had been friends for a long time.  the funniest person on the show would have to be bridget hennessy, played by kaley cuoco. she is the ultimate blonde: gorgeous, slow, dim-witted, yet she is a smart person. she is off the wall hilarious with her innocent 'blonde' humor and how conceited she is.  amy davidson can get a tad annoying as kerry, but that's the purpose of her character. the only fault of the show is that the show never really gives kerry anything to be happy about. she's always after bridget, and her character feels like it's just thrown in there.  martin spanjers as the lone hennessy son is hysterical, and when ritter is on the show, he's mostly comic material. upon the death of ritter, the show does provide some story lines for rory.  david spade and james garner are all nothing but laughs, with the occasional side story for c.j., spade's character. garner plays cate's father, as a bit of background information.  all in all, i give this show a great review because it is a great show that had a tragic event happen that crippled it. you'll enjoy it.  9/10 --spy",1
"from very long, we are seeing movies on gandhi. and mostly, the light is always on portrayal of gandhi as freedom fighter or man with principles. but when i heard that a movie is being made which will highlight gandhi as father and stress on his relationship with his son, it instantly hit my attention as this is one territory which is least being explored as it has his own dark side and less people shown courage to dwell into it. fortunetly, anil kapoor (producer) and feroz abbad khan (director) did.  the story start with gandhi working in south africa and his relationship with white people and his wife. latter akshay (harilal) joined his father for becoming a barrister but his dream took overturn when his father (gandhi) pushed (or motivate) him to become freedom fighter. it showcase that gandhi believes more on practical study rather then formal education. harilal too try to walk on his father footstep but soon failed as its infatuation towards his wife, children and his own dream of becoming big success altered his path and then start the repulsion between son and father. he finally defeated his father in terms of pursuing his dream and to left him on his own terms. he written back to india but then start his unsuccessful stories which become bigger and bigger with time. i am leaving reader to see movie to catch further story...  performance. first akshay. he has given best performance of his tenure so far and is absolutely convincing in his portrayal as harilal gandhi. the scene in which he reach the room where his wife dead body is placed is one where you can see a fine actor which is hidden/developing in akshay. darshan jariwala is also good as mk gandhi and able to live up such a larger then life character. he performed well and with quite an ease. shefali chaya (now shah) as kasturba is brilliant actress and already proved her metal in tv serials. bhumika chawla too performed well but actress of her candidature is waste in these kinds of role. other actor have also justifies their performances.  technique and make up is also good and cinematography especially that duo tone color picturisation was too good. costume looks and match with context.  overall, a worth seeing movie which is defiantly slow in progress and impatient people may find it boring but give you an insight of area which is not brought to silver screen till date. also, the way story progress and connection of scene may look worn to some people and to critics especially but for an average movie watcher like me, it still enough to make me occupied on my seat till end.",1
"when ben (red foxx) discovers his wife beatrice (pearl bailey) has run off with his own brother, he rushes to his son norman (michael warren) to unload his tale of woe--only to discover that norman has a secret lover: the effeminate garson (dennis dugan.) needless to say, ben does not take it well, and numerous complications follow--including ben's attempt to get norman over being homosexual by fixing him up with a hooker (tammy dobson.) unfortunately, this description of the movie sounds a great deal more entertaining than the movie itself.  originally written for the theatre by ron clark and sam bobrick, norman... is that you? was an absolute disaster on the new york stage. to give the play its due, i actually saw it staged in the 1970s as a community theatre production--and while no one would accuse it of being anything other than a shallow farce, the cast played so broadly and in such drop-dead manner that it proved quite amusing. it is a pity the cast of this film didn't do the same.  this is an atrociously performed motion picture. red foxx, one of the most hilarious comics of the 20th century, is about as funny here as yesterday's wash, michael warren (who later appeared on the television series hill street blues to much better effect) competes with foxx to see who can give the worst performance, and pearl bailey is not far behind; truth be told, only dennis duggan, tammy dobson, and a cameo by wayland flowers have any spark--and sadly, that is only in comparison with the rest of the cast.  not only is the film badly performed, it looks bad. according to film lore, this was the first big screen effort to be filmed in videotape, which was then transfered to celluloid for project purposes--and believe me, it shows. the film has the look of a bad 1970s sitcom right down to the painted skyline seen through the windows of norman and garson's apartment.  some films are so bad that they become funny, but norman... is that you? isn't one of them. i can sum up my reaction to this film in two words: miss it. don't buy it, don't rent it, don't touch it with a ten foot pole. just back away slowly and then run like hell.  gary f. taylor, aka gft, amazon reviewer",0
"there's so many negative reviews about ""stay away, joe"" in here i just can't stay quiet any longer and let this injustice happen. here's a side you haven't heard yet.  elvis presley's movies are my guilty pleasure for a simple reason: they are perfect films for a pure relaxation because i don't have to think when i watch them. that means i don't have to worry about missing a complex plot because there never is a proper plot to start with. i can just kick off my shoes, grab a beer, sit back, switch off my brains and enjoy all the general wackiness and catchy easy-going rock n' roll tunes from the grooviest decade of them all.  in my books ""stay away, joe"" definitely falls into the ""so bad it's good""-category. now if you're like me and appreciate ""the trash value"", this is the ultimate 1960's camp experience. it's so bad that it's almost surrealistic to watch and just when you think that it can't possibly get any worse it surprises you in the most imaginable ways. in the end you're so amazed by all the new levels of stupidity you just don't know whether to laugh or cry. in a nutshell: i love it because it's so damn amusing that there once was a generation that actually made films like this. i still give it 1 out of 10 though - once it hits the bottom 100 it will became an instant bad movie classic.",0
"first a technical review. the script is so slow, it is really a 25 minute story blown up to 1 hour 40 min. the dialogue is so flat and truly one-dimensional. the ""acting"" is pathetic, they seem to really have lifted schoolchildren out of class to read a few lines from an idiot board. as for the whole ""point"" of the story, namely ""war is bad"" (oh, there's a shock!) is really non-existent. without out the ""lets shock 'em and get great publicity"" scene nobody would be talking about this film. it is so bad it actually bothers me to think what better things the money used this could have gone on. believe me i've seen some bad ""emperor's new clothes"" films but the one thing i can say for them is at least they were well shot and well made while the camera wobbled during two scenes in this! read all the other reviews - avoid at all costs and don't talk about it.",0
"i have to confess right off that i have never been a fan of rodney dangerfield. indeed, from me he gets ""no respect."" i watched this only because my wife wanted to see it, and found exactly what i expected: a stupid story without any real humour. it's full of lame, crude jokes and a totally ridiculous plot revolving around a developer's (dangerfield) plans to build a ski resort in utah that just didn't capture my attention at all.  in addition to dangerfield the film starred a weak cast, including the likes of andrew dice clay and the totally over the hill john byner (i didn't even know he was still around until i saw his name in the credits for this.)  this truly is a dangerfield disaster.  2/10",0

"this second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense. we know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen. then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them. we know there will be dynamite in the car, that he will lose a wheel, that the car will have a crash, just to speak of the car. and that is what happens. now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film. that he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap. now, how is he going to get out of it? that's what you must discover by yourself. and don't worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story. a speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river. we also know when he is going to be wounded. they did not know what bullet-proof jackets were in those days. it's true recently it was discovered that some gis did not have that kind of equipment in iraq. but what is the meaning of such a film? this insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem. but the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil. why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance? when something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them, to do them. it is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractive.  dr jacques coulardeau, university paris dauphine, university paris 1 pantheon sorbonne & university versailles saint quentin en yvelines",1
"i saw this film in the worst possible circumstance. i'd already missed 15 minutes when i woke up to it on an international flight between sydney and seoul. i didn't know what i was watching, i thought maybe it was a movie of the week, but quickly became riveted by the performance of the lead actress playing a young woman who's child had been kidnapped. the premise started taking twist and turns i didn't see coming and by the end credits i was scrambling through the the in-flight guide to figure out what i had just watched. turns out i was belatedly discovering do-yeon jeon who'd won best actress at cannes for the role. i don't know if secret sunshine is typical of korean cinema but i'm off to the dvd store to discover more.",1
"i am right now in front of the tv, watching casomai. it is changing, it id evolving or better...devolving. it begin with a courius wedding of the two protagonists where their love-story is reported. after that everything change, a child was born, and all the rest usually happen in a couple. it is a not a special movie because it talks about a normal couple, and normality is the center of this movie. it doesn't want to show us something particular, there is nothing new, it is just a normal love-story, the story of a couple, and being normal it become different from the rest. it is also a flashing movie, everything is short, every scene is long just some seconds. it is a reported story, many things are known because friends and parents talk about that, and their opinion is central, the opinions create the story and destroy it. it is a simple story of a couple as i said, but it is not boring, it just show a couple, should be everything known, it is, but i am sure that every one of you will want to know what happen, so don't forget to watch the end!",1
"the plot has already been described by other reviewers, so i will simply add that my reason for wanting to see this film was to see gabrielle drake in all her undoubted glory.  miss drake has to be one of the sexiest, prettiest examples of ""posh totty"" to have been committed to celluloid. of her era and ilk, only the equally exquisite jane asher comes close. what was it about actresses with musical brothers? (nick drake and peter asher) for those who like me have admired gabrielle, her scenes in this movie will not disappoint. she has a magnificent figure and none of it is left to the imagination here.  as a whole, the movie is very poor and being of its time, very cheaply made. the song that covers the opening credits seems to go on forever and is appalling.",0
"refreshing `lost' gem! featuring effective dialog combined with excellent acting to establish the characters and involve you enough to care what happens to them. the douglas and widmark characters are realistic heroes. palance is his usual evil presence. widmark win the fisticuffs fight scene, a car chase of less than 60 seconds with a `logical' end, and a lengthy chase on foot that shames the overdone chase sequences of contemporary hollywood. you know how it will likely end, but the suspense and interest are sustained throughout. the end of the chase is one of the most realistic you will ever see. the film seems to slow a little past the middle, but stay with it for the rewarding conclusion.",1
"the first hour or so of the movie was mostly boring to say the least. however it improved afterwards as the valentine party commenced. apart from the twist as to the identity of the killer in the very end, the hot bath murder scene was one of the few relatively memorable aspects of this movie. the scene at the garden with kate was well shot and so was the very last scene (the 'twist'). in those scenes, there was some genuine suspense and thrills and the hot bath murder scene had a nasty (the way slashers should be) edge to it. the earlier murders are frustratingly devoid of gore.",1

"after seeing 'break a leg' in vancouver at the release party i thought it was a very enjoyable film.  i had a few outright belly laughs and some of the cameos (eric roberts in particular) were a scream. i haven't heard word about actual release date although i've heard it's close.  the story is simple but is mainly a vehicle for the characters and situations. the script is smooth and seamless, the plot develops effortlessly and the acting is comfortable yet fresh. this film has won at least one award from each of the film festivals it's been in, which is around 10 - 15 or so.  i highly recommend 'break a leg'.",1
"after just finishing the book the same day i watched the movie, i knew what was supposed to happen. i had high expectations of the movie, because of the rating. the only reason i give this movie a 2 out of 10 stars is that it was alright trying to be a movie. i have a couple main points for not liking this movie.  ********** spoilers **********  1. the casting. jack nicholson barely fits into jack torrence's character. also, i would have never picked shelly duvall for wendy. i pictured wendy much differently. i can see why they picked jack nicholson though, the grin, the pointy eyebrows, but he's not supposed to really look 'evil'. he's supposed to look normal, and he turns evil. also, they make one of the worst movie couples. danny was alright, he needed more life though. he acted way to droney.  2. the screenplay. they cut out so many things that were in the book, and added things. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to in the movie were either deleted, changed, or handled wrongly. some of the things that were in the book that i was looking forward to seeing (the hedge animals, the roque mallet, the elevator) were not in the movie, and it was 2 and half hours!! i was extremely irritated.  3. the ending. the ending was changed completly, halorann died, jack froze to death, wendy never got hurt...the overlook didn't blow up. the ending was so cool in the book, and the movie messed it up so horribly, i was apalled. hallorann was never supposed to die, but jack killed him with an ax. if they wanted to kill him, at least have jack use a roque mallet. you never even saw a roque mallet during the whole movie.  there are other things that i didn't like about the movie, but there are things that were all right. the camera angels were cool, the blood coming out of the elevator (didn't happen in the book) was cool, but maybe i was too irritated that the movie didn't go with the book, to try to be scared at all. i reccomend reading the book, before you see this movie. i applaud stephen king for actually agreeing to sign a contract to not dis stanley kubrik any more. i would never have done that, i would have taken all the rights i could get to yell at him all day. i can't wait to see the 6 hour version, at least it has the hedge animals.  rating: 2/10",0
"""the bourne ultimatum"" begins recklessly mid-chase and in pulse-pounding fashion explodes from there as jason bourne (matt damon, absolutely superb) tracks down the masterminds behind the cia black-ops that turned him into the perfect killer in a final attempt to learn his true identity. a devastatingly icy david strathairn as the ""man behind the curtain"" is added to the returning cast of regulars including joan allen (excellent) and julia stiles (non-existent).  like the second entry in the series, i wished paul greengrass' shaky hand-held camera would go static at least for the few minutes of downtime. however, that being said, it's a perfect way to capture the tense, claustrophobic feel of the intimate hand-to-hand-combat scenes and works equally well in the chase scenes which are mostly on foot and across rooftops with the occasional big car pile-up. part of the fun of the bourne series is the constant globe-hopping and manipulation of technology and communications that seem to defy the laws of physics and current capabilities. the bourne films seem to exist in some sort of gritty hyper-reality that is full of technological-based magic. it makes no sense that everyone seems to be just in the right place at the right time, but i'll be damned if it isn't a blast to watch them get there.  with the absence of the emotive and involving franka potente, the writers attempt to create some emotional connection between damon and stiles, but she is so blank-faced an actress it never really leads to anything. still, this can be forgiven, for unlike the ""identity"" and the ""supremacy"", this ""ultimatum"" reveals all and we finally learn the truth about bourne's past. it's an entertaining and satisfying conclusion to the series, and if they have any good sense, and damon gets his wish, this will be the perfect end to it.",1
"i give this movie 3 out of 10 because i have watched zillions of movies and i can tell clearly what an intellectual movie with a mind-teasing message should look like. definitely, the broken is not one of those movies. i have to admit that the movie made me think a lot trying to understand what the whole thing was trying to lead to and despite the explanations i've read in prior comments, they seemed only an exaggeration just to have one self in the intellectual league of people. the photo on the cover clearly shows that the broken is the broken upper piece of the face which normally contains the brain. it's a clear message that once this part of the body is broken the rest will be deformed and lifeless. so, you start waiting on the movie characters to show their defected sides and this is not obvious in any of the scenes because the movie starts right away without any introduction to the characters and their lives before. though we see the father holding a rifle when his children try to surprise him as if he is aware he has enemies but still this is not a very strong clue. had the clues been planted more in the movie, one would have said about that it is a masterpiece indeed. but though the movie was so slow in pace, it was at the same time so empty with no metaphorical scenes at all. and the reuniting of the evil dad with the evil gena at the end is a strong refuting evidence of the existential messages that some people spoke about in other comments. furthermore, if gena truly lives in the apartment as her brother tells her at the end, then how come she is the evil one? i bet i can defy any theory about this movie with so many questions that can only lead to one conclusion: this movie is a pretentious one and a waste of time. obviously it shows someone trying to make out of a meaningless mystery something which is of no value at all. i am a huge fan of horror movies and specially slasher ones that some people call popcorn movies. horror movies are not supposed to convey deep messages! they're supposed to uncover the beautiful mask of life and show you the other dark side of it which is the truest, i guess. horror movies should have blood, screams, intensity, skeletons, body organs and parts. because that is the real horror and it's never away from reality. i have watched almost all horror movies and i can prove that each one of them can be as real as the sunrising. nothing is unreal as long as the mind had thought of. for instance, the horror movie ""train"" with all the slashing and tensity of it and its similarity almost in everything with ""hostel"", it speaks about a very real thing which is selling body organs illegally by abducting people in foreign places where no one would ask or search for them.  and even if we considered the broken a movie that has an existential message, it is still very poorly presented and the least scary. i prefer the addiction message presented in requiem for a dream which went beyond drug addiction to highlight the fact that any kind of addiction whether for sex, tv, safety/being pampered, etc... can be so destructive and it scared the hell out of me. and those who always criticize horror movies for being meaningless and very commercial, are usually just bunch of people who get scared easily and simply don't like this genre but this doesn't mean that there are fans of such movies and that they have a lot to offer to the viewer from adrenaline turmoils, ecstasy, leadership lessons (believe it or not!), entertainment to most importantly the face to face interview with the essence of life, as ugly and scary as it may seems, death!",0
"as the film begins a narrator warns us the screaming skull is so terrifying you might die of fright--and if such happens a free burial is guaranteed. well, i don't think any one has died of fright from seeing this film, but a few may have died of boredom. the screaming skull is the sort of movie that makes ed wood look good.  very loosely based on the famous francis marion crawford story, skull is about a wealthy but nervous woman who marries a sinister man whose first wife died under mysterious circumstances. once installed in his home, she is tormented by a half-wit gardener, a badly executed portrait, peacocks, and ultimately a skull that rolls around the room and causes her to scream a lot. and to her credit, actress peggy webber screams rather well.  unfortunately, her ability to do so is the high point of the film. the plot is pretty transparent, to say the least, and while the cast is actually okay, the script is dreadful and the movie so uninspired you'll be ready to run screaming yourself. true, the thing only runs about sixty-eight minutes, but it all feels a lot longer. add to this a truly terrible print quality and there you are.  there are films that are so bad they are fun to watch. it is true that the screaming skull has a few howlers--but the film drags so much i couldn't work up more than an occasional giggle, and by the time the whole thing is over your head will roll from ennui. if it weren't for peggy webber's way with a scream, this would be the surefire cure for insomnia. give it a miss.  gft, amazon reviewer",0
"something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot. the movie, that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema, fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making. the best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning, that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistake.  the editing is poor. direction is crap. acting is out of this world(omg)! the characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumes.  i wouldn't watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the tickets or even gave me a free burger with it.",0
"the comic banter between william powell and jean arthur is the highlight of this murder mystery, which has one of the most bizarre and unlikely plots ever. powell is probably the most suave detective of the 30's, and arthur has a unique voice which often sounds like a succession of tiny tinkly bells. they are extremely fun to watch, so take the brashness of the plot with a grain of salt and just enjoy seeing it unfold. eric blore also has some comic turns as powell's butler.  powell's contract with mgm included a clause which allowed him to reject being loaned out to another studio, but he wanted to work again with arthur and he liked the script, so he eagerly accepted the assignment. they had worked together in two 1929 paramount films, the canary murder case and the greene murder case, both in the philo vance series.",1

"i had a personal interest in this movie. when i was 17 and just out of high school i got a job at 20th century fox as a member of the laborers and hod carriers union. at the end of my first day (sweeping the deck of an aircraft carrier) i was told to bring a suitcase the next morning with enough clothes etc. for one or two weeks. when i arrived the next morning a bus was waiting and about 20 of us headed south toward san diego. just short of there we stopped at an army base called either camp callan or camp hahn. once we were bunked in we went north a few miles into camp pendleton, the big marine base. there, on the beach, we started building what was supposed to be a japanese pacific island base. it took us about a week or ten days to complete the installation, which included a water tank, gun entrenchments, sand-bagged trenches and living quarters. all this was at very high pay, sometimes 'golden time', which was triple our regular hourly wage. our food was also first rate = prime rib at lunch, etc. - which was amazing because it was wartime and very hard to get good meat at home.  once the job was finished i waited eagerly for the movie to come out, which was about eight or ten months later. then i waited eagerly through two hours of the movie before my handiwork finally came on screen. then it was no more than three or four minutes (maybe less) of the movie's heroes dive bombing the base and blowing it to smithereens. a bit disappointing, but still fun.   in spite of the disappointment i enjoyed the movie and have not seen it since. i learned later that this movie was underwritten by the government and fox was paid on a cost plus basis, which maybe accounts for our extravagant pay and lifestyle down there. bob weverka",1
"certainly not horrible, but definitely not good.  cry, the beloved country (1995) was directed by darrell roodt and written for the screen by ronald harwood (adapted from the 1946 novel by alan paton). starring james earl jones and richard harris.  the film is about pre-apartheid south africa, and the stories of a black man and a white man intertwining. the pious but naive preacher stephen kumalo (james earl jones) receives a letter from johannesburg saying that he must come immediately; he later finds that his son has killed a man. the rich farmer/landowner james jarvis (richard harris) finds that his son, a fighter for black rights, was the one killed by kumalo's son. in this they connect.  i cannot compare it to the 1951 film of the same name, for i have not seen it. or the 1974 musical titled lost in the stars for i have also not seen it; both look better than this one. but cry freedom, on the other hand, i have seen; it has a much more urgent air to it, like it actually is trying to say something where the film cry, the beloved country seems to have no idea where it is going. very ""wishy-washy"". i refuse to compare the film to the novel (except that i did enjoy the novel more than i enjoyed the film) because novels and films are two extremely different media and there is no point in trying to transfer directly one to the other or compare them via the same means.  frankly, this movie blew. well, i guess it wasn't that bad, --five-out-of-ten, -- but it wasn't that good either. both of the leads, both very capable actors pull some of the most wooden performances i have seen with some of the most awkward dialogue in film history (but that can be blamed on he screenwriter, ronald harwood, who is also oddly off is game with this film, having also written the sublime the pianist, and being julia). among other things the point and themes of the novel are lost almost entirely in its transition to film for the third time; there is little, if any, tension with any moment of the film, racially or suspensefully. the music doesn't help. the painfully misplaced and boringly pastoral orchestra tracks really help with this dulling down of the film. one upside is the cinematography, with many rather good or great shots, but unfortunately, this does not help the film too much.  the last, striking words of alan paton's novel are displayed in the last moments of the film. it is too bad that they seem to be so disconnected from the film that was just shown. i don't know what nelson mandela might have seen in this film.  thanks for your time.",0
"when ritchie first burst on to movie scene his films were hailed as funny, witty, well directed and original. if one could compare the hype he had generated with his first two attempts and the almost universal loathing his last two outings have created one should consider - has ritchie been found out? is he really that talented? does he really have any genuine original ideas? or is he simply a pretentious and egotistical director who really wants to be fincher, tarantino and leone all rolled into one colossal and disorganised heap? after watching revolver one could be excused for thinking were did it all go wrong? what happened to his great sense of humour? where did he get all these mixed and convoluted ideas from? revolver tries to be clever, philosophical and succinct, it tries to be an intelligent psychoanalysis, it tries to be an intricate and complicated thriller. ritchie does make a gargantuan effort to fulfil all these many objectives and invests great chunks of a script into existential musings and numerous plot twists. however, in the end all it serves is to construct a severely disjointed, unstructured and ultimately unfriendly film to the audience. its plagiarism is so sinful and blatant that although ritchie does at least attempt to give his own spin he should be punished for even trying to pass it off as his own work. so what the audience gets ultimately is a terrible screenplay intertwined with many pretentious oneliners and clumsy setpieces.  revolver is ultimately an unoriginal and bland movie that has stolen countless themes from masterpieces like fight club, usual suspects and pulp fiction. it aims high, but inevitably shots blanks aplenty.  revolver deserves to be lambasted, it is a truly poor film masquerading as a wannabe masterpiece from a wannabe auteur. however, it falls flat on its farcical face and just fails at everything it wants to be and achieve.",0
"i happily admit that i'm a sucker for a beautiful film, and sufficiently inventive camera movements and angles can be enough to keep my interest in a fairly long film. not one the length of gojoe though, even though it had some of the most remarkable cinematography i've seen since the korean period piece musa. however, gojoe provides far more than just beautiful images (as does musa... don't which to imply a contrast) - it's second greatest strength is superb acting, and a fascinating story with some very dark philosophy. i must admit to being quite unsure what the point was it was trying to make in the end, but it definitely provokes some thoughts along the way. vague ones, but definitely thoughts :p  one department in which the film could have been better is the action. there's a tremendous amount of bloodletting in the film, but the action is all filmed with hyperkinetic close-ups, and frequently obscured by objects in the foreground. it does create some very intense and impressive visuals, but it would have been nice to see some more actual moves, something to make it more believable that the villains could just wade through entire armies laying waste to everyone.  still, the film is definitely one of the most interesting and most beautiful films i've seen for quite some time. recommended!",1
"this independent, b&w, dv feature consistently shocks, amazes and amuses with it's ability to create the most insane situations and then find humor and interest in them. it's all hilarious and ridiculous stuff, yet as absurd as much of the film should be, there is a heart and a reality here that keeps the film grounded, keeps the entire piece from drifting into complete craziness and therein lies the real message here. this film is about how we all survive in a world gone mad. that seems to be the heart of the film. for as insane and off the wall as things get, leon, the 30 yr. old paperboy-protagonist, always tries to keep it together. he's like a child forever trying to catch the balloon that is floating away so that everything will work out for the best, so that everyone can have what they want.  the acting in the film could have went far over the top but the exceptional cast really keeps the piece cohesive. van meter is perhaps the best of the bunch here with a performance that shines through her absurd diseased tics. just as the characters in the film do, we overlook her sudden outbursts to see the real person underneath.   majkowski is a true genius here. he takes the utmost ridiculous plot twists and keeps them real. it is his script and his cast that help keep the whole thing afloat. it's a true testament to the skill of majkowski and all involved that this film, with it's grating plot and characters, never once works our nerves. majkowski has taken a film that could have been abrasive and repugnant, and somehow given it heart and humor. this is a unique film. not to be missed.

"for the most part, on demand delivers some pretty horrible horror movies, and only offers other horror movies everyone has already seen, and already have an opinion on. it was either this, or invinicible (i like mark wahlberg movies), which i haven't seen, and i was actually in a movie watching mood, which doesn't happen often anymore because i've already watched all the movies i own a million times, and that's a lot of movies, and i don't have much interest in new movies, and boy, this movie made me regret it. i'm not going to put in any spoilers, i'm just going to tell you that only a few of the very few actors in this movie ,are half way decent. i think the main girl, the dead one who kills everyone, is very annoying looking, but convincing; i'd take her for psycho bitch anyday, so she fits her roll well, though it is lame. the blood isn't that great, only a few of the kills, or may i say ""woundings"" are alright, but you don't see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries look more convincing. towards the end of the movie i was begging my girlfriend to turn it off, and being a band member, the 'recording' parts weren't very interesting either, though what happened would truly happen when going about recording. i'm done, if you want to watch this, suit yourself.",0

"after playing a nymphomaniac in written on the wind, dorothy malone finally said good-bye to her sweet sister/wife roles and demonstrated an ability to play mantraps with the best of them. she and gloria grahame played the same sort of tramps--and for her efforts here in a very manipulative role, malone won a best supporting actress oscar.  the film she's in is not quite up to oscar standards, but it is a strong enough melodrama under douglas sirk's capable hands. there's an almost noirish look to the explosive opening scene and it sets the tone for the rest of the sudsy fireworks in a story that has rock hudson, lauren bacall, robert stack and dorothy malone as its headliners.  domestic squabbles among the inhabitants of a wealthy family with an oil background are the primary focus of the drama, with the accent on the strong supporting players, stack and malone. both of them seize the opportunity with both hands and stack, too, should have been awarded for his sterling job as the weak, alcoholic brother driven to desperation by his own wild motives.  the nominal stars have less impressive work to do, but do it with their usual skill and conviction--hudson and bacall. they play their more sympathetic roles with quiet authority and understanding.  the use of color is particularly striking (as it usually is in a sirk film) and yet it doesn't preclude me from thinking of the film as a technicolor film noir in the vein of leave her to heaven.  well worth watching with some interesting performances from the entire cast.",1
"dvd has become the equivalent of the old late night double-bill circuit, the last chance to catch old movies on the verge of being completely forgotten like the border. there were great expectations for this back in 1982  a script co-written by the wild bunch's walon green, jack nicholson in the days when he could still act without semaphore and a great supporting cast (harvey keitel, warren oates, valerie perrine), tony richardson directing (although he was pretty much a spent force by then)  but now it doesn't even turn up on tv. the material certainly offers a rich seam of possibilities for comment on the 80s american dreams of capitalism and conspicuous consumption, with nicholson's border patrolman turning a blind eye to the odd drug deal or bit of people trafficking to finance his wife's relentless materialism, until he rediscovers his conscience when he finds out his partners are also in the baby selling business. unfortunately, he never really gets his hands dirty, barely even turning a blind eye before his decency rises to the surface. the film feels always watered down as if too many rewrites and too many committees have left it neutered and, sadly, the recent dvd release is a missed opportunity to restore the original, nihilistic ending where nicholson goes over the edge and firebombs the border patrol station that was cut after preview audiences found it too downbeat but which still featured prominently in the film's trailers.  while that probably wasn't too convincing considering how low-key nicholson's crisis of conscience is in the film, it had to be better than the crude reshot climax where the film abandons logic and even basic rules of continuity: at one point he's holding characters at gunpoint, then he's somewhere else and they're free trying to kill him, one character goes from injured at his house to hopping around like a gazelle on the banks of the rio grande while valerie perrine's character gets dumber on an exponential level. the villains of the piece are disposed of with absurd ease (and one impressive car stunt) in time for a clumsily edited happy ending and you start wondering if you somehow found yourself watching another film entirely. what makes it all the more clumsy is that the rest of the film is so flat and underwhelming that the sudden lurch into melodrama is all the more jarring. unfortunately ry cooder's beautiful title song, across the borderline, says it all much more economically. but if you want to know the film's real crime, it's completely wasting the great warren oates in a nothing bit part. when even he can't make an impression, you know something's really wrong. all in all, all too easy to remember why i found this so forgettable at the time.",0

"8 simple rules for dating my teenage daughter had an auspicious start. the supremely-talented tom shadyac was involved in the project. this meant that the comedy would be nothing less of spectacular, and that's exactly what happened: the show remains one of the freshest, funniest, wittiest shows made in a very long time. every line, facial expression, casting choice, scene, all wreaked of perfection. there was not one episode after which i thought, ""man that wasn't as good as the rest"". each one was a standout. again, this is the kind of perfectionism that we've come to expect from tom. for those who don't know, tom shadyac is the director of ace ventura (first movie), the nutty professor (first one) and liar liar. quite a résumé. he's a producer here not a director, but his magic touch is felt in every episode.the family consists of:  the father: paul hennessy (john ritter): nice, slightly neurotic, can be a pushover from time to time, works as a sports writer. john unfortunately passed away in 2003 leaving a fond memory and near-sure cancellation contemplations by the suits.  the mother: cate (katey sagal): come on, who didn't fall in love with katey when she played peg on married with children? al bundy was our hero. we viewers gave him the respect and love he never had. but without peg's nonchalant, parasitic, lazy lifestyle, al would've probably been just another chicago dad instead of the mess that peg (life, actually) caused him to be. katey was a milf back then and still is: a brune now (instead of a redhead) and just as buxom as ever. cate is the conservative mom and loving wife. i know it sounds boring, but comedically, she fits perfectly.   the ditzy blonde daughter: bridget (played to perfection by kaley cuoco): almost never has an idiot been played so well. aside of gob on arrested development, bridget may well be a shoe-in for any awards given to this archetype. bridget is shallow, self-centered, not very bright and a tad slutty in his look. she plays the dumb blonde role better than absolutely anyone imo. perfection. one of the high-points of the show.  the overlooked geeky daughter: kerry (amy davidson): a brune and a geek, she gets no love from life or circumstances. feels overlooked, under-appreciated and neglected most of the time. she's bridget's younger sister (in reality she's older than her) and the two's extremely opposite personalities and brains cause endless clashes, to much of our amusement.  the son: rory (martin spanjers): was the second funniest character imo before the passing of ritter, then john passes, new characters come and rory is not the wise-cracking verbal-trouble-maker that he used to: that went mostly to david spade's character.   those characters were the main ones at the time of john ritter. unfortunately enough, the insanely hilarious larry miller (one of my favorites) did not get lots of screen time. he played paul's co-worker/competitor. after an aortic dissection cost ritter his life in 2003 (september 11th), the show was on hiatus for a while. no one thought it could come back, but it did later on, with a couple of new additions. this began the second phase of the show, and the new characters were:  the strict, confident school principal: ed (adam arkin): i saw adam here and there on talk shows. this was the first time that i saw him do anything. impressed, is the word i use. his performance was very impressive. sad he wasn't brought in earlier. he also plays cate's potential love interest after paul passes. the gradual progress towards this point (which would've sounded crazy at the beginning) earns the creators lots of praise. it was done slowly, carefully and excellently, with constant respect paid to the paul (ritter).  the attitude grandpa: jim egan (james garner): a surprisingly welcome addition to the series, he was cannon fodder for endless 'old' jokes, mainly by...  the 35-year-old unemployed wise-cracking half-brother of the mom: cj (played to insanely funny heights by david spade): i knew spade was funny, i just didn't know he was this funny. somehow, spade's very familiar presence is sensed inside his character (as opposed to a separable character), which is understandable, since he's a comic and he's on a comedy show. this eerie feeling is kinda like seeing someone borrow lots of material from david spade's appearances in movies, talk shows and functions (award shows, etc.) and delivering a superb impersonation of spade's voice and comedy style, except, that it is spade. by that i mean you realize he's not trying to play someone else, or a whole new character: he's being the goofy, funny spade we've come to know, and he takes this pleasantly humorous formula to the absolute top. every line he uttered, every sarcasm he begot, all classics, literally. spade was crazy-funny; so, so funny.  the show's humor and drama were both upped after the show was back, but audiences thought, ""john passed, it ain't gonna be the same anymore"". this is understandable, considering we are talking about a group of people (american viewers) who gave 'yes dear' a free ride but caused andy richter controls the universe to be cancelled in no time. as the show's quality increased, its ratings declined. soon it was no more, sadly.   and i saved the best for last: fans of married with children are in for a treat. and boy, what a treat it was. i still shiver just remembering it. it's a surprise so good that it would be crazy for me to spoil it, even if i legitimately do it under the ""spoiler..."" pretext. suffice it to say that it's something you'll never forget. i know i won't :-)",1

this one is a little better than the first one. it still relies on a lot of its humor which basically keeps saying that the old bond movies were not realistic. that wears thin after so many parodies. the girls were more interesting in this one.  there is a tremendous amount of total gross out humor. hopefully one day real comedy will come back.,0
"there is an awful lot wrong with this picture, beginning with a script that is both obvious and redundant. courtney cox plays a comic book artist who escapes to a small desert town after being raped twice in the big city. she immediately is stalked by a local who appears quite unhinged (craig sheffer), and who seems to be attempting a third rate mickey rourke imitation. d.b. sweeny is a local cop, who is supposedly there to protect and serve. meanwhile, the script manipulates the audience as to who's really the good guy? logic flies out the window after the first ten minutes and never returns, and there are more unanswered questions than there should be. if you think ""blue desert"" might be saved by the wonderful philip baker hall, you will be disappointed. his part is insignificant, just like the entire movie. - merk",0
"based on the average short story by horror writer stephen king about so called 'sleepwalkers' ancient and immortal cat-like creatures that suck the life out of virgins in order that this energy may sustain them they have supernatural abilities- they can make themselves 'dim' which means they become invisible and can create subliminal mirages to fool people.they have been fleeing humans for century's we are told and have one by one been picked off till there are only two left.the film starts when a beautiful mother and her son arrive in a sleepy town, they are the last of the sleepwalkers and they are on the prowl for virgins to feed on. the mother sends her son out to enrol at the local high school so he can find a virgin, he does (madchen amick) and proceeds to try to get her alone so he can suck her dry. it is not made clear why the mother cannot seek out virgins herself- it would make things easier one would imagine as teenage boys are much more apt to follow a older beautiful woman to a secluded area than a teen girl follow a teen boy. however his plans are thwarted as the girl fights back, jabbing a pencil in to his ear. the police are called and the hunt is on!. the son is sick from his injuries and so the mother goes on the rampage killing cops left and right in her hunt for the girl who hurt her son and spouting some painfully unfunny one liners amidst the gore. finally the girl kills the mother- end of movie. this movie is rubbish!. the acting is variable, from the average brian krause to the excellent alice krige. the special effects are average,and showcase some early computer effects which is mildly interesting as it shows how far such things have progressed in such a short time. the direction is muddled and the film falls in to camp in places. the director seems unsure whether we are supposed to fear the sleepwalkers or sympathise with them and when in doubt allows the film to become hysterical. stephen king makes a mildly amusing cameo as an annoying gardener as does mark hamill, as a puzzled cop. alice krige seems to shoulder the film, her character is given depth and she gives an indication of what the film could have been with a better screenplay and better direction.",0
"the movie is basically a boring string of appalling clichés which do not offer a real cross-cultural insight. the middle eastern leg of the journey is described in a particularly irritating way: there obviously are mud brick villages, dirt tracks in the middle of the desert, women clad in black robes and belly dancers. i wonder how camels and date palm trees were missing from the whole picture. the personality of the two main characters is very clumsily sketched and many situations are hardly credible.   the original idea might have been interesting, but at the end of the day if you are looking for cultural insight, you should skip this movie.",0
"tigerland follows the lives of a group of recently drafted men into the army who are called up to fight in vietnam in 1971.  at this point, america knows they are fighting a loosing battle, and the director takes us through a 16mm handheld documentary shot film of the lives of several recruits in the 'tigerland' training camp in louisiana.  the film is more of a character study no real plot, but it focuses on a key character roland boz, who is a dissabordinate yet intelligent man, who only wants to escape the camp. we are taken through several characters in the unit waiting for the story to unfold.  i'd have to say this is a great story about vietnam and more importantly about the army in general.. great acting, and very memorable. also the directors use of film and style works so well, cause it looks a lot like the old film footage you always see regarding vietnam. its great to see how the film shows that all the infighting and problems were so significant to the problems of fighting this battle. the particular scene where boz walks away from a training mission where an instructor is showing how to use a radio as a torture device just about sums up everything about war in a nutshell... and it's futility.  fantastic film. not just about nam but about who individuals have to decide what is morally right by being 'in the army'.  rating 9 out of 10.",1
"""the invisible ray"" is part science fiction and part horror. it was also the third of seven karloff/lugosi features. in this entry the dominant role goes to boris karloff.  through specially designed astronomical equipment, dr. janos rukh (karloff) demonstrates to colleagues dr. felix benet (bela lugosi), sir frances stevens (walter kingsford), his wife lady stevens (beulah bondi) and their nephew ronald drake (frank lawton), that a meteorite containing a powerful element, landed on the african continent many millions of years in the past. rukh impresses his guests who invite him to accompany them on an expedition to africa to find the mysterious element.  rukh goes off on his own and discovers the place where the meteorite landed and the element which he names ""radium x"". due to rukh's long absences, his comely young wife diana (frances drake) becomes attracted to drake and the two fall in love. meanwhile rukh becomes contaminated by radium x to the point that anyone he touches will die instantly. the contamination causes his skin to emit a bright glow in the dark.  rukh goes to benet for help. benet devises an antidote which if taken on a daily basis, will provide temporary immunity to the element. unfortuneatly, the deadly element also affects rukh's brain, slowly turning him into a vindictive murderer.  while rukh is continuing his work, sir frances takes news of the discovery back to france. diana and ronald accompany him. when benet informs him of this action, rukh accuses the party of betraying him and his discovery and secretly plans his revenge. when he returns to france he learns of the healing power of radium x as he cures his mother's (violet kemble cooper) blindness and of benet's work in curing the maladies of his patients.  but rukh's madness intensifies. first he murders an innocent man whom is identified as rukh. upon hearing of rukh's apparent demise, diana and ronald marry. this angers rukh and he begins to exact his revenge on the five other members of the expedition. one night he is lured into a trap set by benet and...........  karloff is excellent in the lead role moving from a happily married ambitious scientist to a raving maniac. lugosi has a straight role for once and does what he can with the limited part.  at 79 minutes this film was the second longest of the six karloff/lugosi collaborations. karloff's film all the way.",1

"'1408' is the latest hodge podge of cheap scare tactics. the kind that might make date-movie styled horror fans occasionally jump in their seat and scream in your ear, but disappoint audiences searching for a little depth and direction.  john cusak plays a writer who's made a career of writing books describing his experiences of staying in rumored haunted hotels. despite assurances by patrons and owners that ghosts roam the halls, there is little to make him a real believer in the paranormal. when he learns of the history of room 1408 at the overlook hotel--no wait, i mean, dolphin hotel in new york city--he decides it would make the perfect closing chapter to his latest book. but, samuel l. jackson, playing the hotel owner, strongly attempts to dissuade his guest with narration of the atrocities that have occurred in theat room since the hotel's opening many years ago. the story is simple and we, as possible skeptics, must sit through jackson's lengthy foreshadowing ramble.   in other words: be afraid! be very afraid!  of course, it would be easy to convince audiences that they've just paid to see an edge-of-the-seat thriller if it didn't take so long to build up to this point. and also, if what followed was a lot more than cheap ""boos"" that become so frequent and arbitrary that eventually, you might soon expect them. the temperature in the room changes automatically. the walls drip with blood. the fearless writer can't open the door, etc. and after nearly an hour and a half of delivering these to audiences promised big thrills, you might sit and hope that at least you can be wowed by the ending. with suspicions of dream sequences and other derivative time-wasters, even that fails to quell our doubts that before the movie is over, we might finally have something to make the movie a little less than completely forgettable.  despite grand performances (as always) by cusak, who essentially is the entire film, most everyone else of note is wasted (i.e. samuel l. jackson) in insignificant minor roles. the true mystery here is how this movie received such a high viewer rating. ballot-stuffing ghosts?",0

"i get to the cinema every week or so, and regularly check out this site, but never before have i felt compelled to comment on a film.  to my all time list of shockingly bad films - last man standing, spawn, the bone collector - i can now add the drivel that was 'hollow man'.  from the awful opening titles - a ridiculously over-long run through of cast and crew put together with alphabetti spaghetti - through to the insulting finale - a world record number of cliches and some of the most absurd dialogue and acting to have ever made it to cinema - this film is dismal, and only the impressive computer graphics keep you from walking out long before the end.  this isn't just my opinion - it was that of my friends, and everyone around us. when large sections of an audience are laughing and groaning during and after a serious thriller, its clear that the film is hopeless.  not only that, it was sick too. the director took the action beyond the bounds of realistic fare for a violent film, and into the realms of an over the top blood soaked b-movie. it's difficult not to imagine the director as some sort of dirty old man, because the extent of the invisible man's forays out of the lab and into the outside world extended only to two attempts at having a feel of some breasts. perhaps sex could well be the first thing on a bloke's mind if made invisible, but aside from the aesthetic pleasures of the ladies involved, it hardly makes entertaining cinema.  [spoilers follow]  get past the films sick exterior, and things are even worse. whilst kevin bacon does a good job of acting increasingly twisted as 'hollow man', the rest of them - perhaps handicapped by a dire script - do an even better job of being hollow cast. one long time member of the team is found strangled in a locker by the invisible man, ""he's finally snapped"" shrugs one colleague without a hint of emotion. this is par for the course, and the lab team swing between sheer terror and complete indifference with such speed that you wonder how they got into acting. they pad their way through the lab corridors terrified, guns poised, but then seconds later one of the crew skips happily off back down the corridor to get blood for a hurt colleague. the lead female treats the invisible man with courtesy and good humour even after he's insulted and abused her, and there seems to be little reaction to his breakouts, even after he drowns the pentagon chief, ""he drowned in his pool last night"" reports the same female, spectacularly failing to put two and two together.  the script is littered with this kind of badly acted pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an a-z of film cliches, which get laid on thicker and faster as the film progresses to the point of complete disbelief and amusement at the end.  the 'eureka' moment at the computer, the female undressing at the window, the looped security video - the list really is endless - the predictable disregard for strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but just put them in a place of probable impending death and leave them to their own devices, the almost-dead good guy appearing out of nothing to save the woman, the bomb and ubiquitous countdown timer, the fireball explosion which just burns up before reaching the heroes, the falling lift which just stops before hitting them, and more than anything else, the immortality of the bad guy.  the invisible man is burnt to a shred with a makeshift flame-thrower, electrocuted, whacked round the head with a bar which had just sliced straight through one of the lesser actors, and then having apparently survived the explosion, fireball and total destruction of the labs, has more than enough life left to climb up through the fireball for one last pop at the films heroes - by which stage the disbelieving audience are cringing and looking at their watches.  that this exceptionally bad film actually made it to the cinema is astounding. even the name of the film is as hopeless as the movie itself, and not even impressive special effects come anywhere near saving this one, which should be avoided at all costs.",0
"this is certainly one of my all time fav episodes of trek. there is just so much going on in this one film that its crazy cool. first the guys beam down to an alien planet thats about to explode. they meet a freaky librarian type dude (very well played). then kirk manages to get himself transported back to what is very much like 16th century earth. mccoy and spock try to follow but instead nearly freeze to death on the frozen version of the alien world 100,000 years in the past. kirk manages to get himself locked up and charged with witchcraft while spock enjoys some amok time with a sexy cavegirl who was vanquished to the this frozen, awful world by some bad guy.  spock decides hes happy where hes at and gives mccoy a royal assestment whuppin' when the doc suggests they need to look for a way out. anyhow,they all finally escape, leaving the poor cavegirl behind. it takes a ton of convincing before spock finally gives in and leaves. you can literally taste the sadness at the end. leaving the cavegirl all alone in her frozen wasteland just seems cruel and is really touching. spock must have been out of his vulkin' mind to leave behind his greatest hope for love and being human. albeit, in a not so nice neighborhood!  anyway, you just get so much bang for your buck with this episode....a love story, the salem witch trials, spock as a human, the desperation of being left in total isolation...abandoned, and three entirely different settings on the alien planet. its amazing they managed to jam all this into one fifty minute film. this one is a classic, don't miss it....i want it on dvd fer shure vulcans!!!!!!",1
"the pervert's guide to cinema (2007) ****   if loving cinema makes me a pervert, so be it!  if you are a true 'moviefreak' like me then i'm sure you can't get enough of films about film-making and i don't mean necessarily the dry documentary know and then. i mean a total discourse on the film viewing experience. well if that's the case have i got a lulu of a film experiment for you.  in sophie fiennes (sister of ralph & joseph if you were wondering) has noted philosopher cum cinephile slavoj zizek give his analysis on cinema with some impressive (and often outrageous) takes on everything from the silent era of chaplin thru the modern age of the wachowski brothers analyzing, probing, and pontificating about the psychosexual underpinnings, socioeconomic, political and of course indefinable magic of the film going experience with his unflagging, determined and near-frenetic dissertations. to go from explaining how the bates' house in psycho is actually the mirrored psyche of the conflicted norman bates with each level as his ego, superego & id is one thing but then to suggest the same thing about each marx brother in barely a beat is a remarkable test of faith that wins over the skeptic layman.  although i had no idea who zizek was  he resembles a hybrid of filmmaker brian depalma, european actor rade serbedzija and the hyperkinetic energy of filmmakers quentin tarantino and martin scorsese  with his sibilant tongue and passion, the host comes across as a mad prophet.   fiennes cleverly inserts zizek into several of the film clips' backgrounds peppered throughout making for a humorous tone but still lets the ranting and raving continue full throttle giving pause for argument in three acts covering the gamut of films by the likes of kubrick, lynch, hitchcock and films as diverse as the wizard of oz, the red shoes, and fight club.   there's something for everyone and if one man can provoke an argument or at least a reason to discuss a film's themes  even if they are freudian/jungian to a fault  then i say this collection of film theory is worth the watch. seek it out now if you can before it comes to home video; it's the only way to appreciate it.",1

"running only seventy-two minutes, this small, overlooked 2006 dramedy is really just a two-character sketch piece but one that works very well within its limitations. taking place almost entirely in various, non-descript spots in southern los angeles, the story itself is inconsequential, but like sofia coppola's ""lost in translation"", the film is far more about two strangers who meet unexpectedly, find a common bond and go back to their lives enlightened for the momentous encounter. it also helps considerably that morgan freeman and paz vega are playing the characters. finally freed of the wise sages and authority figures beyond reproach that have become his big-screen specialty, freeman seems comparatively liberated as a somewhat self-indulgent movie star. his character is driven to a low-rent grocery store in carson, where he will be able to research a role he is considering in an indie film.  out of work for a few years, he is embarrassed when he sees dvds of his films in the bargain bin, but his ego is such that he does not lack the temerity to watch and even mimic the enervated store staff. of particular fascination to him is scarlet, an embittered worker from spain and relegated to the express line where she is the unsung model of efficiency. she has an interview for a secretarial job at a construction company, but her deep-seeded insecurity seems to defeat her chances already. still looking like penelope cruz's amazonian sister, the beautiful vega (one of the few redeemable aspects of james l. brooks' execrable ""spanglish"") brings a stinging edge and realistic vulnerability to scarlet. she and freeman interplay very well throughout the story, which includes stops not only at the grocery store but also at target, arby's and a full-service carwash. nothing earth-shattering happens except to show how two people realize the resonating transience of chance encounters.  silberling keeps the proceedings simple, but the production also reflects expert craftsmanship in phedon papamichael's vibrant cinematography (he lensed alexander payne's ""sideways"") and the infectious score by brazilian composer antonio pinto (""city of god""). there are fast cameos by bobby cannavale (as scarlet's soon-to-be-ex-husband) and as themselves, danny devito and rhea perlman, as well as a funny bits with jonah hill (""knocked up"") as the clueless driver and jim parsons (the ""knight"" in ""garden state"") as a worshipful receptionist. the 2007 dvd is overstuffed with extras, including a making-of documentary, ""15 days or less"", aimed at film students and running a marathon 103 minutes; six extended scenes; a light-hearted but insightful three-way conversation between silberling, freeman and vega in the middle of target; and a couple of snippets that specifically advertise the dvd.",1
"don't think of this movies as just another kids movie - the whole family can enjoy it. its a strange mix of a movie, as its seems to have a movie within it, but at least it does make sense at the end (unlike modern films!) it does give you all the elements of a film (decent plot, good characters - well it does star the muppets, a list of lesser celebs* which films would clamour for) what is surprising, is the fact that it can be a roller coaster of emotions, some sad, some heartwarming, some funny and some serious - it all makes an enjoyable family film that everyone can watch together.  * the celebs in the film are actually top stars of the day but there is only one true star of the film and no one dare outshine miss piggy!!!!",1
"the original title means ""the birth of the octopuses"". i must confess that i do not quite understand this title. the english title is ""water lilies"". but after having written this, i read the comment by another user: ""the title in french is also suggestive: ""prieuve"", or octopus, suggest an individual having to juggle many pressures simultaneously."" thanks for your explanation.  the basic theme is the first sexual emotions of girls, when it is not clear if they are directed toward the same or the other sex. it is no different for boys. i think that both floriane and marie will eventually have heterosexual feelings without any admixtures.  much of the movie is water ballet. sometimes the girls will have their heads downwards, and nothing above the water except their feet and lowers legs, with which they will wave and kick in the air. to people like me who had never seen such things before, it was fascinating. - floriane is the leader of one team of ""water lilies"".   marie tells her that she would like to see when floriane is training. this seems to be their first contact that is not just ordinary. soon they will walk together. floriane takes marie to a garage where a boy is waiting for her, and then goes away with him for an hour, while marie is waiting for her to return. i took for granted that the couple slept with each other. but we will later learn from the movie that they do less than that.   i can supply some information which few users will find elsewhere. there is a scene in which marie secretly steals floriane's garbage bag. in it she finds an apple, mostly eaten. and marie proceeds to eat the rest.  there is a parallel scene in another movie, ""kazetachi no gogo"" (afternoon breezes) by hitoshi yazaki (japan, 1980). this is about adult young females, and a clearly lesbian woman is vainly in love with a heterosexual woman. she also steals a garbage bag of the beloved, and also finds a more or less eaten apple and eats the rest.   later floriane tells marie that she would like to have her first orgasm from her. marie says she cannot do this.   but still later marie says that she is indeed willing to do it. and she masturbates on floriane. there is no nudity in this scene.   probably only a female director could have made such a fine psychological show or study of  i would like to quote baudelaire, ""les amours enfantines"".  floriane is played by adèle haenel, who made the excellent performance as the autistic girl in ""the little devils"" by christophe ruggia (2002)  a very underrated movie.",1
"do we really need any more narcissistic garbage on the baby boomer generation? technically, i am a boomer, though at the time when all the ""idealistic youths"" of the '60s were reading marx, burning their draft cards, and generally prolonging a war which destroyed tens of thousands of lives; i was still in grade school. but i remember them well, and 9 out of 10 were just moronic fools, who would believe anything as long as it was destructive.  this is just another excercise in self-importance from the kids who never really grew up.",0
"i first saw this movie when it originally came out. i was about 9 yrs. old and found this movie both highly entertaining and very frightening and unlike any other movie i had seen up until that time.  basic plot: an expedition is sent out from earth to the fourth planet of altair, a great mainsequence star in constellation aquilae to find out what happened to a colony of settlers which landed twenty years before and had not been heard from since.  theme: an inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a greatly advanced alien civilization, the krell-200,000 years removed. the ""seed"" of destruction from one civilization is being passed on to another, unknowingly at first. the theme of this movie is very much good vs. evil.  i first saw this movie with my brother when it came out originally. i was just a boy and the tiger scenes really did scare me as did the battle scenes with the unseen creature-force. i was also amazed at just how real things looked in the movie.  what really captures my attention as an adult though is the truth of the movie ""forbidden knowledge"" and how relevant this will be when we do (if ever) come into contact with an advanced (alien) civilization far more developed than we ourselves are presently. advanced technology and responsibility seem go hand in hand. we must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of how to use advanced technology. this is, in my opinion, the great moral of the movie.  i learned in graduate school that ""knowledge is power"" is at best, in fact, not correct! knowledge is ""potential"" power depending upon how it is applied (... if it is applied at all.) [it's not what you know, but how you use what you know!]  the overall impact of this movie may well be realized sometime in mankind's own future. that is knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we must, must have the wisdom that knowledge depends on to truly control our own destiny or we will end up like the krell in the movie-just winked-out.  many thanks to those who responded to earlier versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated!! i hope you are as entertained by this story as much as i have been over the past 40+ years ....  rating: 10 out 10 stars",1
"unlike many other films, which are disturbing either by dint of their naked unpleasantness (man bites dog) or their sheer violence (most peckinpah films), deliverance shocks by its plausibility. certainly, the buggery scene is pretty straightforward in its unpleasantness, but the film's effect derives far more from its slow build-up and the tangible sense of isolation surrounding the four leads, both before and after everything starts to go wrong. the moment when the canoes pass under the child on the bridge, who does not even acknowledge the men he had earlier played music with, let alone show any sign of human affection towards them, is among the most sinister in modern film. the tension increases steadily throughout the canoe trip, and perseveres even after the final credits - the ending makes the significance of the characters' ordeals horrifically real. the movie's plausibility is greatly aided by the playing of the leads, particularly ned beatty and jon voight as the victim and reluctant hero respectively. burt reynolds, too, has never been better. the film's cultural influence is demonstrable by the number of people who will understand a reference to 'banjo territory' - perhaps only get carter has done such an effective hatchet-job on a region's tourist industry. i can think of only a handful of movies which put me into such a serious depression after they had finished - the oppressive atmosphere of se7en is the best comparison i can think of. although so much of it is excellent of itself, deliverance is a classic above all because there are no adequate points of comparison with it - it is unique.",1
"prison is not often brought up during conversations about the best eighties horror films, and there's a good reason for that because it's not one of the best...but as you delve past the classic films that the decade had to offer, this is certainly among the best of the lesser known/smaller films. the film does have some connection to blockbusters; for a start it's an early directorial effort for renny harlin; the capable director behind a number of action films including die hard 2, cliffhanger and deep blue sea; and secondly we have an early role for lord of the rings star viggo mortensen. the film is not exactly original but the plot line is interesting. we focus on a prison that has been reopened after a number of years. this was the prison where a man named charles forsyth was sent to the electric chair after being framed by the prison's governor. naturally, the spirit of the dead man is not resting in peace; and when the old execution room is reopened, the spirit of the dead convict escapes for vengeance.  the film is not exactly the shawshank redemption, but it does take care to build up its various characters and while the main point of the film is always the horror, the prison drama behind it all does make for an interesting base. this is a good job too because other than the basic premise, the film doesn't really have a 'plot' to go from and we solely rely on the interaction between the characters to keep things interesting. the horror featured in the film is at times grotesque but it's never over the top, which might actually be the reason why this film is seldom remembered, being released in a decade of excess. the murders themselves are rather good and imaginative, however, and provide some major highlights. as the film goes on, we start to delve more into the back-story of the vengeful convict's ghost and while it's fairly interesting, some things about it don't make sense and it drags the film down a little. still, everything boils down to an exciting climax and overall i have to say that prison is a film well worth tracking down.",1
"having read the reviews for this film, i understandably started watching it with a great deal of doubt in my mind that it would actually be any good. however, this is one of the best films i have seen in a long time. the majority of reviews that i had read, said that the complicated plot made it too hard to follow. and whilst some parts do leave you confused, the ending ties up so many loose ends that you feel like kicking yourself because you've missed so much. it's not like ""lock, stock..."" or ""snatch"", in the sense that it isn't that funny (in fact, it's pretty dark), and it is a lot more intelligent, in the way that you see parts of scenes from different viewpoints (and, in one of the best scenes of the film, jason statham spends five minutes in a lift having an argument with himself). the way in which it is similar to the two films i just mentioned, is that it is full of memorable characters, specifically statham, who gives a fantastic performance as the lead, and ray liotta, who spends most of the film in speedos, but gives a great performance none the less. if you've got time, and have time afterwards to think about the film, and even watch it again, you really start to see all the symbolism and hints that are laid out through the film. i think it's fantastic, and that guy ritchie is a director on top of his game.",1

"the perfect son is a story about two 30-something brothers, one who is seemingly ""perfect"" and the other who is basically a screw-up, frequently landing himself in drug rehab centers. after the death of their father, the two are brought together after a long absence and the usual sibling rivalry resurfaces. it isn't until the ""perfect"" brother makes the startling revelation that he has aids that the irresponsible younger brother finally makes a move to get his life in order, and take some responsibility.  the movie does a nice job of chronicling the younger brother's ""comeback"", though it may seem a bit far-fetched at times (beating drug addiction is never so easy). what makes the film more tender is the treatment of aids, a topic that has become somewhat passe in cinema over the last 5-10 years. and also the development of an almost sweet relationship between the two formerly feuding brothers is very believable and well-done. the two main actors were both very competent, if not terribly charismatic.  a solid first feature effort from director and writer leonard farlinger whose own brother died of aids. the ending is nicely done as well.

"okay, during this past thanksgiving break, whilst having the whole family together everybody decided to go see a movie, and since fred clause was voted majority, thats what we went and say.   to start off the movie had so many plot holes it was pathetic. simple explanations of why a certain event was happening was void. example; who the heck is trying to 'shut down' santa clause? is it some sort of corporation? a little explanation would of been lovely.   second: the movie tossed you flimsy characters that evoked no sympathy from you about their feelings or actions. example: the little elf named willie and the only tall girl in the elf village. they see each other twice and then they are a couple and i could of cared less because this movie didn't make me care.   third: i suppose this was suppose to be a family film? its rating was low at just pg. for a family film there were several articles of suggestive conversation. it didn't bother me, but if i were a parent i could see a problem.   through the whole movie paul giamatti looked extremely bored with his role, but honestly he was the only one worth watching in the movie. vaughn had a few funny moments but played the same character he has for the last two movies. mouthy frat boy. (nothing against vaughn, he's been good in other movies)  so this movie gets a 3 out of 10 stars from me, just because somebody had to put in the effort to produce, film and release this flick.   in my opinion i would definitely pass on this flick, or if you have to see it save it for a rainy day rental.",0

"what about dahmer's childhood?- the double hernia operation which is believed to have sparked off his obsession with the inner workings of the human body? what about ""infinity land""? - the game he invented as a child which involved stick men being annihilated when they came too close to one another, suggesting that intimacy was the ultimate danger. what about the relationship between his parents, and the emotional problems of his mother that were far more relevant than just his own relationship with his father? his feelings of neglect when his brother was born? what about his fascination with insects and animals? how he would dissect roadkill and hang it up in the woods behind his home?what about focusing more on his cannibalism? and what about his parent's divorce? these are all things that should have been included in the film. instead the film maker chose to give us a watered down 'snapshot' from a night or two in his life, and combine it with series of confusing and at times unnecessary flashbacks, to events that weren't even particularly relevant to our understanding of dahmer.  why didn't the film maker show how dahmer was interested in people as objects rather than people? he could have made this point many times, particularly in the scenes in which he drugs his victims whilst he has sex with them (which actually took place in a health club, not a night club). instead he just shows him ramming away at them from behind.  whilst i appreciate there is only so much information you can cram into 90 minutes (or however long), but why spend such a large part of the film examining his relationship with luis pinet? (known as rodney in this film). my only guess is that the director was trying to build up pinet's character, to try and make us fear for or empathise with him, but this film is supposed to be about jeffrey dahmer, so why couldn't he have spend those forty five minutes on something else? if the scene and their relationship was important enough to warrant such time then fair enough, but it wasn't. the scene in which he kills steven hicks, his first victim, is a vital part of the jeffrey dahmer story because it was the first killing, and because of the effect that killing had on the rest of his life. unfortunately the film doesn't explain that it was his first killing, or that he didn't kill again for nine years. we assume, because his hair style is different, and he is wearing glasses that this is a flashback, but to when? and why?   what about the shrine he made in his sitting room towards the end of his career?-one of the most important clues we have towards understanding dahmer and his motivations..  some people may find my need for accuracy in fact and detail a bit anal, but having studied jeffrey dahmer in depth, it is plain to see that this film has very little in common with the person he was and the crimes he committed. why bother to spend the time making a film loosely based on jeffrey dahmer rather than tackle the real issues behind his descent into madness and the carnage that ensued?  finally, a film with subject matter as repellent as this should carry an 18 certificate, not a 15. we needed to see his perversion in more depth, to understand just how detached he was from the rest of us. that doesn't mean showing the drill actually entering konerak sinthasomphone's head for instance, but at least an indication of the amount of people he killed, and what his modus operandi was when actually killing. anyone watching this film who doesn't know the story of dahmer might come away thinking he had only killed a few people. he actually killed seventeen men.  aside from the facts and lack of depth, the film isn't all bad. there is some nice cinematography, and good performances from the two main characters. i'd like to see this done again by a film maker who has more knowledge, more energy, and a better reason for making the film in the first place.",0

"yet again, early morning television proves an invaluable resource for films that i otherwise would never have been able to track down. at four o'clock in the morning, i stumbled out of bed to begin recording 'the informer (1935),' my fourth film from prolific american director john ford, and an excellent one at that. set during the irish civil war in 1922, the screenplay was adapted by dudley nichols from the novel of the same name by liam o'flaherty. though he was born in the united states, and is most renowned for his ""americana"" pictures, both of ford's parents were irish, which explains the director's decision to direct the film. victor mclaglen plays gypo nolan, a brutish but well-meaning ruffian who informs on an old friend, frankie mcphillip (wallace ford), in order to claim the £20 reward for his girlfriend, katie (margot grahame). when frankie is killed during his attempted arrest, the irish republican army, of which both frankie and gypo were members, begins to investigate the traitor behind the incident, every clue bringing them closer and closer to the real culprit.  meanwhile, gypo is plagued with guilt for his friend's untimely death, and descends into a bout of heavy-drinking that rivals don birnam in 'the lost weekend (1945)' in its excessiveness. as gypo drowns his sorrows in copious volumes of alcohol, trapped in a vicious little circle of depression, his extravagant spending captures the attention of the investigating ira members. for the one time in his life, gypo finds himself surrounded by admirers (including an amusing j.m. kerrigan), who enthusiastically clap him on the back and christen him ""king gypo"" for his physical might. however, it's obvious that these people feel no affection for the man, and are simple showing him attention to exploit him for money. the additional £20 brought by frankie's death could never buy gypo an assembly of friends  indeed, in a bitter twist of irony, the money was only made possible by the betrayal and loss of one of his only good companions. a relatively simple fellow, gypo could not possibly have fully considered the consequences of his actions, and is eventually offered forgiveness on account of his ""not knowing what he was doing,"" but his foolishness must not go unpunished.  criticism is occasionally levelled at ford's film for its allegedly propagandistic support of a ""terrorist"" organisation. though this stance obviously depends on one's personal views {i certainly don't know enough irish history to pass judgement}, there's no doubt that the film portrays the irish republican army as selfless, dedicated and impartial, a proud piece of irish patriotism if i ever saw it. however, the main theme of the story is that of betrayal; driven by intense poverty, one ordinary man betrays the confidence of his good friend, and comes to deeply regret his actions. the tormented gypo is played mainly for pity, and victor mclaglen gives a powerful performance that betrays a lifetime of unsatisfying existence, culminating in one terrible decision that condemns him to an uneasy death. 'the informer' was john ford's first major oscar success, winning a total of four awards (from six nominations), including best actor for mclaglen {who snatched the statue from the three-way favourites of 'mutiny on the bounty (1935)'}, best director and best screenplay for dudley nichols {who declined the award due to union disagreements}.",1
"2002's undeservedly popular ""i love the 80's"" is an inane, idiotic, offensive and downright disgusting pop-culture mess of a show that was the first in a long-line of horrid television programming that ultimately spelled out the end of vh1, which was at one time the only real music-oriented channel left on tv! i used to practically live on vh1 up until the spring or winter, i forget which one now, of 2002 when garbage like this started to appear for absolutely no reason whatsoever. out of sheer morbid curiosity (i'd guess that's what you'd call it) i had decided that i would go ahead and give it a look-see anyhow the first night it came on even though the advertisements looked like complete crap. at least i can honestly say that i wasn't a bit disappointed by it because my expectations were obviously bottom basement-level to begin with. the emphasis of this show i found out within the first 5 minutes was less on each year of the 1980's and what was and wasn't culturally significant or popular (which is what i was expecting to see), but instead more of an impromptu platform for a whole slew of really god-awful no-name comedians to display what they more than likely think is their comedic skills *rolls eyes*...more like lack-thereof if you ask me! it's pretty easy now to see why no one had ever heard of any of these idiots before they appeared on this show because they are all so terribly unfunny and pathetic in their attempts at so-called ""humor"" that i swear i could feel my intestines knot up with each and every rancid one-liner they shot off one after another! altogether, i have no problem in saying that ""i love the 80's"" was/is trash of the lowest denominator, and one of the main reasons why i almost never watch vh1 anymore.",0

i've seen the original english version on video. disney's choice of voice actors looks very promising. i can't believe i'm saying that. the story is about a young boy who meets a girl with a history that is intertwined with his own. the two are thrown into one of the most fun and intriguing storylines in any animated film. the animation quality is excellent! if you've seen disney's job of kiki's delivery service you can see the quality in their production. it almost redeems them for stealing the story of kimba the white lion.

"as noted by other reviewers this is one of the best tarzan movies. unlike others however, i like the beginning of the film as it feels like a pretty accurate depiction of what a trading post must have been like. plus the exposition is needed so we know why harry wants to go back into the jungle. in addition the beginning of the film contains one of the most thrilling and terrifying chase sequences ever made.this occurs when harry's safari group has to outrun a tribe of cannibals. the pre-censorship production values add a lot of realism, genuinely depicting the terrible dangers that awaited europeans going into the jungle. the film also offers, though perhaps antecedently, an accurate account of how horribly treated the native africans were by their white employers. in addition sexy jane, thousands of elephants , some great sets and two chetas! not to be missed an adventure classic.",1

"i guess this movie will only work on people who were all turned off by the giant hype of lord of the rings. well, so i was. and so i really love this movie. especially i like all those flawless superheroes from lotr being so perfectly and disrespectfully parodied. most brilliantly is the counterpart of gandalf (the brave and wise and completely humorless know-it-all wizard): almghandi, the cowardice and brain dead transvestite. sauron's counterpart (""sauraus"" from east germany, of course) is wearing a simply bucket with eye holes as a helmet. aragorns alter ego is yet another accident prone idiot who tries to fix his broken sword (""ulrike"" the legend) with scotch tape. and ""strunzdumm"" (the counterpart of wormtong) indeed has some strong resemblance with brad dourif! and don't forget grmpfli and heidi... huh-huh",1
"ouch, what a painfully boring sci-fi movie! and that's especially saddening because the opening 15 minutes were so action-packed and full of potential! during the intro, we follow a bunch of nervous security officers and hired hit men as they chase a doctor who escaped from a mysterious laboratory with a briefcase full of top-secret files. as he's about to reveal the supposedly horrible & inhuman events that take place in the lab, he's executed. figures from then on, the 'action' swifts back and forth between two locations, the aforementioned laboratory and the rural mansion of a corrupt senator (or something), and it quickly becomes clear that the experiments are actually the complete opposite of disturbing. more like dull, pointless and vague. scientists selected four random persons without living relatives and it's really really really really important that they speak the truth even though a giant machine reads the content of their minds, anyway. they all hide dark secrets from their pasts and people suffer when get revealed; yet i fail to see how these tests could ever result in a humanity-threatening device. perhaps i missed something, but i doubt it. the interactions between the patients and doctors are even less interesting to follow, as really none of them have personalities. so basically, ""the brain machine"" just handles about a bunch of lame people living in an awfully decorated room. the film also could have been half an hour shorter if it weren't for a thousand stagnant shots of buildings! the relocations from the lab to the villa and vice versa are indicated every single time by a five-second shot of the places. either the makers really needed the padding or they just assumed that all sci-fi viewers are morons unable to notice a change of location by themselves. staring at a forsaken pool with a mansion in the background for the tenth time in only five minutes becomes quite annoying, i assure you. james best's performance as the reverend with mental issues is rather decent, but one man definitely can't save this thing from being an absolute waste of time. avoid!",0
"i watched this movie when joe bob briggs hosted monstervision on tnt. even he couldn't make this movie enjoyable. the only reason i watched it until the end is because i teach video production and i wanted to make sure my students never made anything this bad ... but it took all my intestinal fortitude to sit through it though. it's like watching your great grandmother flirting with a 15 year old boy ... excruciatingly painful.  if you took the actual film, dipped it in paint thinner, then watched it, it would be more entertaining. seriously.  if you see this movie in the bargin bin at s-mart, back away from it as if it were a rattlesnake.",0
"the 40 year old virgin, is about andy stitzer, a forty year old man who works in an electronic store and doesn't have much of a social life and is very awkward around women. some of his co-workers at the store invite him out one night and they discover that andy, is still a virgin so they plan to help him lose his virginity. one day in the store andy, meets a woman named trish, who gives him her phone number and eventually andy, works up enough courage to go on a date with her and they start to really like each other but andy, is still very awkward when it comes to sex and he is going to have to tell this to trish, much to his embarrassment if he can actually get up enough courage to tell her before things get awkward. the 40 year old virgin, has good direction, a good script, good comedic performances by the whole cast, good cinematography and good film editing. the film stars and is co-written by steve carell, who does a very good comedic breakthrough performance and his writing for the film is very good too. i was very pleasantly surprised with this film. it is sweet, funny, entertaining, fun, enjoyable, clever, good natured and a good time. this film is just as good as this year's wedding crashers, and both films are two of the best comedies i have seen in awhile. the 40 year old virgin, really showcases a lot of talent and it is put to good use and it works as a comedy and a romance and it is sweet and a lot of fun. one of the biggest surprises and one of the best comedies of the year.",1

"in the seemingly endless quest to find well made, well acted horror films, it is all-too-rare to find one that even comes remotely close to hitting the mark. needless to say, i was very pleasantly surprised when i stumbled across ""burned at the stake"" on a u.s. cable network while i was flipping channels. the premise is reasonably simple. in 1692, young ann putnam (swift) is the most vocal witness against alleged witches, leveling baseless charges against anyone who earns her displeasure. manipulating her for his own ends is reverend parris (peters) who also serves as the court's guide on matters pertaining to witchcraft and satanism. things get complicated when ann starts accusing members of the goode family of witchcraft. salem (of 1980 or so), loreen graham (also played by swift) begins having unusual visions shortly before she visits the salem witch museum. a strange man in seventeenth century garb tries to accost her there and the building. he continues to stalk her while strange phenomena begin to involve her more and more. soon, it appears that she is becoming possessed by the spirit of ann putnam. unfortunately, further description gets rather involved and would give too much away. though the film is not action-oriented and would likely be of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth century dialogue used in the film's many flashbacks sounds very convincing. the production values are solid with the possible exception of some of the special effects. in a side-note, the film's technical advisor was laurie cabot, salem's official witch. viewers who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, but understated horror film may appreciate this. the writer/director, bert i. gordon, has had a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a number of ""big bug"" films and similar works years earlier.",1

"i agree with most if not all of the previous commenter's tom (bighouseaz@yahoo.com). the zatoichi series is a great character study combined with great sword fighting and excitement.  i have seen zatoichi 1-13,15,16; i believe 14 has not been released on zone 1 (usa). zatoichi the outlaw was disappointing. the story line was complicated, and seemed to be a hodgepodge of many previous zatoichi story lines. at one point, i was wondering if i was not seeing a remake of a previous zatoichi film.  this film was disappointing because it started to depend on effects (a head rolling, limbs severed, blood) and less on the nobility of the zatoichi character. all the previous films succeeded based on the storyline and action, and won a great following without having to resort to effects.  i am just hoping that the remaining zatoichi films do not follow the same trend. this is the first zatoichi film from his studio. i highly recommend all the previous zatoichi films -- and recommend them.",0
"if you really enjoyed the 2002 resident evil movie, then you should just see it instead of waisting 2 hours you'll never get back. i can not believe that no one has commented that this movie is just a cheap knock off of re. first, a ""special"" commando force is the unique defense for a facility with a computer matrix that has an ai and holographic projection. and this ""hive"" rip-off has a series of traps that inevitably kill off one member of the squad at a time. there's even a chess reference in the code names, which was in the dialog of re. despite the fact that there are no zombies, the ""rook"", the movie's nemesis, is some sort of bio-creature, very pail in color suggesting necrotic tissue, with a lot of cyborg components just like a super mutant of re. so, a wag-of-the-finger to mr. richard taylor for claiming any credit for this story.  they are not the same movie obviously, but the writer got the idea watching resident evil i think.",0
"this movie was directed by victor nunez who also wrote the screenplay (ulee's gold). nice and straightforward writing, that was nominated for the independent spirit award, looking at ruby's day to day life. what we see is a slice in the life of the young woman ruby. ashley judd (sisters) won the independent spirit award best female lead for this role. ruby is starting to live on her own and establishing her own identity. she explores jobs, friendships, boy friends, sex, a typical young adult search. the movie won grand jury prize at the sundance film festival. as an independent film enthusiast i picked the movie because of sundance. i appreciate this type of movie, because it does not carry the hollywood baggage.  although the stories are completely different this reminded me of nobody's fool, staring paul newman. the later movie is a slice of the daily life of a common man. i like that. the story is very nicely told, and all we had to do was sit and enjoy the story. the only thing i am not sure about is the title. i am sure that there are not that many bugs, and flies in paradise as there are in florida. as i am allergic to mosquitos, florida is no paradise to me, i itch all over thinking about florida. i turn into a complete red boil. i recommend this movie! favorite scenes: ruby and her friend rochelle bridges, played by allison dean walking at the beach of panama city, florida. indeed the sand is very white. i have been there. favorite quotes: ""necessity has always been a good excuse."" ""all that fuss over finding a man is not at all different now, who is going to be and when and why.""  ",1

"to be honest, i didn't like ""executive decision"" - which was obvious the template - very much, but compared to this piece of crap, it looks like a masterpiece of art.  not only that the people moving in the film (the term actors would be an insult for all other actors) should attend more acting classes, the guy who build the setting hasn't even seen an aircraft from afar. it is so ridiculous, that on a 747 only 3 flight attendance are aboard, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. the film is full of illogicalness (e.g.: use sleeping-gas, then don't use it, then use it anyway), which dropped my rating finally to the bottom.  you can have more fun in rearranging you sock drawer or in drilling a hole in your knee and fill it with milk.",0

"seeing as the world snooker championship final finished in a premature and disappointing manner with ronnie o`sullivan defeating greame dott by 18 frames to 8 bbc 2 found a gap in their schedule and so decided to broadcast a walk on the moon a movie i had absolutely no knowledge off  i missed a few seconds of the title credits so had no idea viggo mortensen starred in it and thought possibly it might be a cheap tvm , certainly the opening with the mawkish pearl and marty taking their kids to a summer camp has that sort of made for tv feel though the brightly lit ( too brightly lit ) cinematography seemed to suggest this was a cinematic film and it wasn`t until the appearence of viggo mortensen as hippy guy walker that i realised this was a cinema release , after all someone of mortensen`s stature wouldn`t star in a tvm , i mean that`s like a legend like robert deniro appearing in a straight to video film . wait a minute , didn`t bob .... ?  some people on this site have mentioned that pearl and marty are an unconvincing on-screen couple and i agree . i can understand why pearl would be attracted to exciting hippy guy but have no idea why walker would be attracted to plain house wife pearl . the sixties was before my time but surely if you`ve got the choice between hippy chicks and bored house wives it`s not really a choice at all . mind you a lot of people took lsd in those days so i guess that explains it  i feel the major problem of a walk on the moon comes down to the fact it`s a romantic drama at heart ( just like you`d expect in a tvm ) with several cloying coming of age scenes so why include a fairly explicit sex scene ? it jars with the rest of the movie and is possibly off putting to the menopuasal women who were 20 something in 1969 . i say possibly because the movie also seems to aim at a teeenage market with the coming of age scenes and those teenagers will probably be bored with the historical and social context of man walking on the moon and woodstock . in other words a walk on the moon tries to attract many types of audience but will probably appeal to none of them",0
"i have to start saying it has been a long time since i have seen it, but have seen it 5 or more times; a wonderful little romp that was clearly inspired by the musical/comedy pairings of new or fading stars with musical groups of prominence. kay kyser's mysteries would be a good example.  having spike jones unleashed is the best part of the show, as he and his band play many tunes and are a part of the action, doing a fine job of support. hugh o'brien plays the face, buddy hackett the part rumor has it that was offered to lou costello and thus, abbott and costello replacing the leads. don't know if that was true.  all in all, a pleasant movie, but important to have that much spike jones and his band on film for history. wish that it was released, as i haven't seen or heard of it now in two decades. hope it is not lost",1
"nice attempt and good ideas (redemption of the prostitute, human beings helping each other out,...) but a poor result... the director obviously tried to emulate his french colleague tran anh hung by recreating an ambiance which is suppose to portray viet nam... the only problem is that this viet nam is long gone and when ""the scent of the green papaya"" had a historical background... trying to project this kind of ambiance (muffled sounds and the slow pace of life...) on modern days leaves a feeling of fake. besides it rapidly creates a sentiment of boredom and the outcome becomes too obvious.  i can only suppose the action takes place in saigon or da nang because that is where harvey keitel, ex-marine in the movie, was probably stationed during the war... but in southern viet nam nobody or very few people speak with the clip northern accent displayed by the actors... seriously odd even for a bad vietnamese speaker.  an old poet with leprosy...very doubtful (not a disease for people of his condition), a peasant girl who can read and write elaborate vietnamese poetry,... even more doubtful...

"in the area of movies based off of screenplays from some other area (or whatever the title for that oscar is), ""holes"" has credibility. i think it is better to have the author create the screenplay because the author is the creator of the material. if the author can't write a screenplay to save their life, then have the author and someone fluently talented in the area of screenwriting create it. aside from that, this review is about ""holes"".  the reasons start here and a spoiler maybe found within. (1) louis sachar is an excellent author and it turns that he can write a screenplay. i watched the movie and then read the book and both didn't reek incoherence or stupidity. some people just have natural talents that can transcend mediums. (2) the best performance award goes to shia labeouf for his portrayal as the main character. he ""dug"" himself into the role. i wanted to see his character vindicated before the conclusion. (3) to ratchet up the suspense a bit, andrew davis was brought in. this is the man that made harrison ford run hard and run fast. he also can make steven seagal smash some heads. as for this film, he made shia and the rest of the boys dig some holes. in other words, he can make an ""action-packed"" movie and make it well even if ""action"" isn't the main genre isn't ""action"". (4) my second favorite performance goes to jon voight as mr. sir. sometimes a goofy role brings out the best in a performer. when voight uttered the line ""once upon a time..."", i must have laughed for half a minute because it was so funny. he is capable of comedy and he should investigate a few more roles that let him to exercise that talent. (5) tim blake nelson is very solid whenever he is given a solid script. this is probably the second best role i have seen him in (second only to 'o brother where art thou?'). (6) i love the choice of settings for the movie. i didn't know california was that dry or that barren. i guess population and land area figures both can be misleading. (7) the overall look of the movie made me want another bottle of water. one could only imagine digging a hole in that barren area for half a day. (8) the rest of the cast should deserve a box of kudos bars as well. sigourney weaver, henry winkler, khleo thomas, jake m. smith and the rest of the bill were tapped because of their talents and it gelled very well. great cast even though it was anywhere near ensemble. (9) i like a movie that doesn't explain anything right away. when stanley got clocked in the head with those baseball cleats, it made me want to see how weird the events could get and that is a key ingredient in making a good movie. (10) disney pictures (not touchstone, disney!!) needs to make a few more of these mature juvenile films. it was palatable for me and i am a college student. the last mature juvenile disney film i saw was ""something wicked this way comes"" and ""holes"" possibly exceeds it (like the election in 2000, it's still to close to call). disney can make greatness if they decide to expand on this genre and keeps artistry in mind over milking a cash cow when they see it. ten reasons give a score of ten!  all in all, ""holes"" is one of my favorite disney films and probably one of the best this year (granted this movie may not be oscar material but whoever said oscar material is the best material?). in terms of being a movie from a book i have read, this ranks behind ""fight club"" on my list (which is on top). for being a film i saw in 2003, this is in the top five (somewhere behind ""mystic river""). compared against ""harry potter"", stanley yelnats easily takes a shovel to harry's head and brings the final death blow with a smelly sneaker to potter's nose. everybody should see this movie because it both informs and entertains. here ends my rant!",1
"the plot of this enjoyable mgm musical is contrived and only occasionally amusing, dealing with espionage and romance but the focus of the film is properly pointed upon the tuneful interludes showcasing the enormously talented and athletic tap dancing eleanor powell, abetted by tommy dorsey and his orchestra, featuring ziggy elman, buddy rich and frank sinatra. red skelton shares top billing with powell, and he and sidekick bert lahr are given most of the comedic minutes, although skelton is more effective when he, if it can be believed, performs as powell's love interest, with virginia o'brien actually providing most of the film's humor as the dancer's companion. the technical brilliance of powell is evidenced during one incredible scene within which buddy rich contributes his drumming skills, and which must be viewed several times in order to permit one's breathing to catch up with her precision. director edward buzzell utilizes his large cast well to move the action nicely along despite the rather disjointed script with which he must deal, and permits powell's cotangent impossibilities to rule the affair, as is appropriate.",1
"the cat o'nine tails (il gatto a nove code)   aspect ratio: 2.35:1 (cromoscope)  sound format: mono  (35mm and 70mm release prints)  a blind ex-journalist (karl malden) overhears a blackmail plot outside a genetics research laboratory and later teams up with a fellow reporter (james franciscus) to investigate a series of murders at the lab, unwittingly placing their own loved ones at the mercy of a psychopathic killer.  rushed into production following the unexpected worldwide success of his directorial debut the bird with the crystal plumage (1969), dario argento conceived the cat o'nine tails as a giallo-thriller in much the same vein as its forerunner, toplining celebrated hollywood actor karl malden - fresh from his appearance in patton (1969) - and rising star franciscus (the valley of gwangi). sadly, the resulting film - which the ads claimed was 'nine times more suspenseful' than ""bird"" - is a disappointing follow-up, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too plodding and aimless for general consumption.  malden and franciscus are eminently watchable in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer enrico menczer (the dead are alive) uses the wide cromoscope frame to convey the hi-tech world in which argento's dark-hearted scenario unfolds, but the subplot involving euro starlet catherine spaak (the libertine) as franciscus' romantic interest amounts to little more than unnecessary padding. highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded railway station (edited with sleek assurance by cult movie stalwart franco fraticelli), and a nocturnal episode in which malden and franciscus seek an important clue inside a mouldering tomb and fall prey to the killer's devious machinations. but despite these flashes of brilliance, the film rambles aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently without ever really coming to the boil. it's no surprise that ""cat"" failed to emulate the runaway success of ""bird"" when released in 1971.

"i just have to throw my two cents in. relax, it's a comedy. yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted. i can't think of many comedies where they aren't. this isn't a new release, it's out on video and airs on cable almost every week. would i see it in a theater? sure, i did, when it first came out. it's funny...that should be enough.  even if i didn't like it at all i'd still watch it on cable for michael keaton. he's an underrated and under-appreciated actor. i can't think of another who is so capable in every genre. nor can i think of one who's as successful. a comedic actor who's also an action star(short lived but still), who's also a romantic lead, who's also a dramatic actor; a villain and a hero. i can't think of any, at least not in hollywood. certainly none who have been successful at all those genres. i mean there's tom cruise but to me he's better at being tom cruise than becoming a character. however this isn't about michael keaton vs. tom cruise so i'll move on.  gung ho is worth renting, heck it's worth buying since you can probably find it for $10.00 or less at stores like wal-mart. it's worth watching on cable(if you have cable or satellite). it's one of those fun to watch movies. you can put your brain on pause, and just relax, and chuckle away.  to ask for more, in my honest opinion, is asking too much.",1

"there are many different versions of this one floating around, so make sure you can locate one of the unrated copies, otherwise some gore and one scene of nudity might be missing. some versions also omit most of the opening sequence and other bits here and there. the cut i saw has the on-screen title witchcraft: evil encounters and was released by shriek show, who maintain the original us release title witchery for the dvd release. it's a nice-looking print and seems to have all of the footage, but has some cropping/aspect ratio issues. in italy, it was released as la casa 4 (witchcraft). the first two la casa releases were actually the first two evil dead films (retitled) and the third la casa was another film by the same production company (filmirage), which is best known here in america as ghosthouse. to make matters even more confusing, witchery was also released elsewhere as ghosthouse 2. except in germany, where ghosthouse 2 is actually the ogre: demons 3. ok, i better just shut up now. i'm starting to confuse myself!  regardless of the title, this is a very hit-or-miss horror effort. some of it is good, some of it isn't. i actually was into this film for the first half or so, but toward the end it became a senseless mess. a large, vacant hotel located on an island about 50 miles from boston is the setting, as various people get picked off one-by-one by a german- speaking witch (hildegard knef). photographer gary (david hasselhoff), who wants to capture ""witch light,"" and his virginal writer girlfriend (leslie cumming), who is studying witchcraft, are shacking up at the hotel without permission. along comes real estate agent jerry (rick farnsworth), who's showing off the property to potential buyers rose (annie ross) and freddie (robert champagne) brooks. also tagging along are their children; pregnant grown daughter jane (linda blair) and very young son tommy (michael manchester), as well as oversexed architect linda sullivan (catherine hickland - hasselhoff's wife at the time). once everyone is inside, their boat driver is killed (hung) and the boat disappears, so they find themselves trapped and basically at the mercy of the ""lady in black.""  so what can you expect to find here? plenty of unpleasantries! one of the characters has their lips sewn shut and is then hung upside down in the fireplace and accidentally slow-roasted by the rest of the cast. there's also a crucifixion, witches eating a dead baby, a swordfish through the head, someone set on fire, a possession, a sesame street tape recorder, the virgin getting raped by some demon, a guys veins bulging and exploding thanks to voodoo doll pokes and some other stuff. from a technical standpoint, it's a nice-looking film with pretty good cinematography, a decent score and good gore effects. the hotel/island setting is also pretty nice. blair (particularly at the end) and ross both seem like they're having fun and knef is great as the evil witch. even though people like to ridicule hasselhoff these days, he's not bad in his role, either.  on the down side, despite all the gore, the film seems somewhat dull and it gets monotonous after about an hour. the supernatural themes are muddled and confusing, too. when characters are being swept into the witches lair to be tortured and killed, the filmmakers unwisely decided to superimpose the screaming actors over some silly looking red spiral vortex effect that looks supremely cheesy. and the witch lair itself is vacant and cheaply designed with unfinished lumber. and while most of the cast is at least decent, a few of the performances (particularly the ""actress"" who plays hasselhoff's girlfriend and the kid) are so bad they're constantly distracting.",0
"these kind of movies where a psycho of one variety or another tries to damage the reputation (and eventually eliminate altogether) some naive person in order to take over their life. fatal attraction, pacific heights, the hand that rocks the cradle, single white female, and a thousand made-for-tv movies are some examples of this. but while a few, especially fatal attraction and pacific heights could offer at least some extremely paranoid, suspenseful characters or a few plot twists, unlawful entry plays everything by the book. and were it not for the notoriety of its stars (kurt russel, ray liota, and madeline stowe), this movie would sink to mediocrity faster than a danielle steele miniseries.  russel plays michael carr, an incessantly naive guy who calls on the help of a pair of officers when someone breaks into his house and tries to attack his wife (madeline stowe). unfortunately, he quietly vents his anger about feeling so helpless in the situation to the wrong cop (ray liotta), a typically psychopathic villain with no limits for his power. at first empathizing with carr (probably only pretending to do so), the cop befriends the couple. but soon enough, the cops wants carr out of the way so, destroying the guys life nearly any way he can (which is pretty easy when you're a cop, and when you're the cop who has installed the guy's security system in his house) in order to take over and presumably, get his wife. it seems less ends-oriented, and more like the cop just wants to prove his power. the wife is more like a trophy, in other words, than an end. and the story plays out entirely by the book, you can probably predict every occurrence before it happens on the screen if you've seen enough of these movies. from the ""shocking"" moment our main, naive character realizes he is a victim of credit card fraud (perpetrated by the psychopathic villain) to the turn-around-he's-not-really-dead finale.",0
"somebody could probably make a great documentary about the jerry springer show, but this fictionalized version merely succeeds in draining anything authentic and interesting out of the trash-tv phenomenon. there are dozens of famously bad movies (e.g. ""manos: the hands of fate"") that show more creativity and spirit than this dreary, witless waste of film.  seriously, why not a documentary about the jerry springer show, that would begin to answer some of the real questions like: who are these people? what happens to their lives after they appear on this show? how did the mayor of cincinatti find himself here?  one good line: during an ""orientation"" session for guests: ""people, i can't emphasize this enough: no weapons!""",0

"this movie made it into one of my top 10 most awful movies. horrible.   there wasn't a continuous minute where there wasn't a fight with one monster or another. there was no chance for any character development, they were too busy running from one sword fight to another. i had no emotional attachment (except to the big bad machine that wanted to destroy them)   scenes were blatantly stolen from other movies, lotr, star wars and matrix.   examples  >the ghost scene at the end was stolen from the final scene of the old star wars with yoda, obee one and vader.   >the spider machine in the beginning was exactly like frodo being attacked by the spider in return of the kings. (elijah wood is the victim in both films) and wait......it hypnotizes (stings) its victim and wraps them up.....uh hello????  >and the whole machine vs. humans theme was the matrix..or terminator.....  there are more examples but why waste the time? and will someone tell me what was with the nazi's?!?! nazi's????   there was a juvenile story line rushed to a juvenile conclusion. the movie could not decide if it was a children's movie or an adult movie and wasn't much of either.   just awful. a real disappointment to say the least. save your money.",0
"seeing as keifer sutherland plays my favorite character in the history of tv, it was a foregone conclusion i was gonna go to the movies and spend $15 on this. i also think this applies to eva longoria fans.  the movie revolves around a leak that a secret service agent is planning to assassinate the president. as the investigation unfolds, it seems the only likely candidate is the highly decorated pete (michael douglas). pleading innocence, pete goes on the fun, fugitive style, to search for the truth.  it's solid, but certainly not spectacular. a decent cast, a decent story but it left me feeling a bit empty, but you could certainly do far worse.",1

"these reviews that claim this movie is so bad its good are going way overboard with that one. this movie does not have the guilty pleasure badness that leonard part 6, battlefield earth and gigli had. those movies were entertaining in their awfulness but this pile of dinosaur dung is so bad its painful. i haven't been in this much pain watching a bad movie since i watched baby geniuses and superbabies. before i start the review let me tell you the story. theodore rex is a $35 million dollar bust the new line cinema refused to put in theaters. they cut the losses sending it straight to video making it the most expensive straight-to-video movie in decades. whoopi caved in to be in this disaster after a huge paycheck.  plot: a millionaire clones dinosaurs so he can launch missiles at the sun which would kill mankind and start another ice age. a female cop named katie coltrane and an idiotic dinosaur named theodore rex reluctantly team up to stop him after the death of a buddy dinosaur.  the plot is given to you in the beginning of the movie which robs the movie of all its mystery. then you have to deal with the fact that this movie is actually quite awful. whoopi looks agitated and is trying to wing it with her performance but to no avail. theodore rex is flat out annoying and his bumbling behavior wears thin after five minutes on screen. most of the jokes revolve around him threatening to bite people and hitting people with his tail(on accident and on purpose). i thought burglar was bad but it takes a backseat to theodore rex: the worst movie of whoopi's career.  don't let anybody tell you this monstrosity is bad enough to be enjoyable. i didn't see that when i watched this movie. all i saw was a train wreck that was written by people that must have had some sick admiration for movie howard the duck. the humor is on that level and theodore rex looks like the inbred cousin of barney. utterly painful from start to finish.",0
"an interesting idea (four african american women crushed under society's boot heel take their revenge by robbing banks) is ruined by f. gary gray's horribly slow direction and an excruciating script (by takashi bufford and kate lanier) full of unintentionally funny moments. instead of delivering a pointed commentary about the role of urban women struggling to stay afloat in a world where men cruelly abuse and humiliate them, gray, bufford and lanier prefers to pummel their unsuspecting audience with highbrow notions of operatic tragedy. it's melodrama at its worst. gray has his actors linger over every tired line and john carter's lazy editing refuses to pick up the slack, choosing instead to keep his camera trained on the performers' bemused faces. and bemused they are: although actors such as jada pinkett, kimberly elise and vivica a. fox have some raw talent (queen latifah is the fourth and as an actress she's an excellent rapper), they need a surer hand than gray's to guide them and as a result they come off as shrill and uncomfortable in front of the camera. steer clear.",0

"this movie is basically a documentary of the chronologically ordered series of events that took place from april 10, 2002 through april 14, 2002 in the venezuelan presidential palace, caracas venezuela.  the pathos of the movie is real and one feels the pain, sorrow and joy of the people who lived through this failed coup d'etat of president hugo chavez.  one comes away from viewing this film that hugo chavez is truly a great historical figure. hugo chavez's persona single-handedly brought the venezuelan people to overthrow the 3-day old military-installed junta and re-establish the democratically installed government of venezuela.  it is obvious from the film footage that george w bush aided and abetted the venezuelan coup d'etat. that the mainstream media aided and abetted george w bush is not surprising.  what is surprising is how few people has seen this movie and how few people realize the total corruption of america's mass media.  it has taken only 20 years for ronald reagan elimination of the fairness doctrine in 1986 to turn america into blind and rudderless state.  may hugo chavez open patriotic americans' eyes to the truth and beauty of the true american vision.",1
"how the grinch stole christmas instantly stole my heart and became my favorite movie almost from my very first viewing. now, eight viewings later, it still has the same impact on me as it did the first time i saw it.  screenwriters jeffery price & peter s. seaman of who framed roger rabbit fame do a fantastic job of adapting the story of the grinch to the screen. ron howard's direction brought the story to full life, and jim carrey's typically energetic performance as the grinch steals the show.  some detractors of the film have claimed that it is not true to the spirit or principles of the original story. having read the original story, i must say i cannot agree. the movie makes the very same point about christmas and its true meaning as the original story. indeed, it enhances the impact of the story by making it more personal by showing us how and why the grinch became what he was.  *mild spoilers* (they probably wouldn't ruin the movie for you... but if you haven't seen it yet and you're one of those who wants to know nothing about a story until you've seen it, you should skip the next two paragraphs.)  i think just about everyone can relate to the grinch's terrible experiences in school. i think all of us, at one time or another, were the unpopular one in school who was always picked on. i know i was... and that's why i personally had so much sympathy for the grinch and what he went through.  and cindy lou who's naive idealism, believing that nobody can be all bad, was heart rending. when everyone else had turned their backs on the grinch out of fear and ignorance, cindy lou was determined to be his friend. if only everyone could have such an attitude.  in fact, i think the only thing that might've made the film a little better would have been to further tone down the adult humor and content. it was already pretty restrained, but any of this adult humor (like when the grinch slammed nose first into martha may whovier's cleavage) just doesn't fit in a story like this.  this one's well on its way to being a christmas classic, taking a richly deserved place alongside the book and the chuck jones cartoon as a must-see of every christmas season.",1

"i don't like sean penn's directing very much, and this early work, the indian runner, is no exception. the movie has no core, it's colored with a kind of redneck, anti-authoritarian tweeness that in all honesty taints most of penn's work, his latest work even more so than the earlier. frank miller, robert rodriguez, clint eastwood, sean penn, the whole lot seem to produce such fundamentally banal product, ostensibly in some allegiance to honesty, but ending up being, for the most part, glorified pro wrestling matches, and moralistic, almost as if hallmark cards had developed a line of hell's angels greetings, and make me long for the days of deliverance, which is a fine movie. viggo mortensen's acting is much, much more believable here than that ridiculous eastern promises thing he did with cronenberg, and that's about it. the movie is dead meaningless, and seems to be an exercise, a series of techniques, more than a story. kudos for charles bronson, however, who proves he can act. and i wanted more of sandy dennis' character. a lousy 3 out of 10 for this the indian runner crap.",0
"this film really got off to a great start. it had the potential to turn into a really heartrending, romantic love story with cinematography that recorded the love between ""harlan"" and tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. it really didn't need to be anything more than that, and for a moment there i became excited that someone was finally making a beautiful film for its own sake, another timeless classic, a modern myth perhaps. why, oh why, then mess it up halfway through by making the lead character (norton)another psycho? maybe i'm missing the point, but do we really need another film about psychos? or is this need in hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature indicative of a more general malaise in the movie industry? for a moment there, i was going to make a mental note of the director's name; now i'm left feeling indifferent. at least it should be added in the film's defense that all the actors seemed to invest in their roles. also, evan rachel wood is really lovely to look at and a good actress with lots of potential.",0
"this should be my kind of movie. even if it sucked, it still should have been right up my alley; hell, i like ""congo,"" and ""allan quatermaine"" movies. i have a soft spot in my heart for silly alien/demon/adventure movies. let's go over why i decided to watch this in the first place.  1. horror/sci-fi almost always intrigues me 2. i'm a big fan of archaeology, and this movie does involve a rare treasure. 3. super-natural enemies with quality fx. 4. christian slater and dorf i generally enjoy. 5. tara reid is hot.  so this movie had potential, at least in the cheese-horror section of the video store, but boy did it suck ass. the only redeeming aspects are slater and dorf, and not everyone finds them as entertaining as i do...i mean, let's face it, both are melodramatic. but now on to some of the many faults.  tara reid. even though the movie as a whole is worse, reid's performance is truly awful. we're not just talking bad, i'm talking about nominating tara reid for worst performance of the year. i don't know if she is capable of acting, but playing the museum curator is simply out of her league...completely. watching her try to carry the roll of educated scientist wasn't much different than what you get watching the setup in bad porn. i mean this isn't just bad, it is laughably bad. oh, and for those of you curious, she doesn't get naked, only down to a bra in a silly, totally unnecessary love scene.  even with reid's performance, perhaps the movie could have worked, but the plot is what dominates, and the plot seems written by a 10 year old. i hadn't realized this was a video game adaptation until after watching the dvd, otherwise i would have appreciated the stupidity in real-time.   the storyline jumps back and forth from slater's childhood at an orphanage where he gets flashbacks of something terrible that happened, he has amnesia, of course. in his adult life slater was recruited by some unit 713, a paranormal military force that apparently hunts evil or something. slater had to leave because he was too rebellious, i guess, you never really know unless it was in one of those voice-overs i zoned out during. the movie starts with slater hunting artifacts, obtaining his latest piece after some dealings with a ""chilean mercenary force specializing in selling rare antiquities."" i may have the exact quote wrong, but you get the idea.  there is an evil doctor that wants to unleash some hellions on earth (no reason given), experiments on children, super demon/alien-human hybrids, ""photonic"" bullets (the demon things can't stand sunlight) and, of course, slater and dorf to try to save everyone.  jesus, i can't even being to wade through the clichéd elements. the script badly needed reworking to narrow the focus and provide some depth. i mean, why is this evil scientist so damn evil? oh right, humans are doomed and he is just trying to save the human race. i guess he's infected? how did that happen? oh right he has one of the evil demon things in a cage and draws its blood to shoot into himself. how the hell did that happen? why and where did he get the super slugs (oh yes, they use the old sci-fi stand by of parasitic aliens/demons which ""fuse"" with the spine of their host)of course, slater is, like blade, half super-slug powered, but his slug ""didn't fully fuse due to an electrical shock,"" thank god. oh, and the people with these ""fused"" spines, have no idea they're half-alien/demon and act as good members of the community until some secret signal is given whence they turn killer zombies. yeah we get zombies.  so lots of crap that could be entertaining, but none of it is.  also, the ending is completely stupid as everything turns out to be not that big of a deal to fix in the first place...at least nothing a little dynamite can't handle.  not the very worst thing you'll see, but a truly bad movie.",0
"hello there,  this is my first post in imdb even though i use it as a reference for quite a while. i would therefore like to salute you all. the fact that i am a greek is inevitably going to affect my judgement i hope not to your annoyance.  i spent 2 years of my life, (all we greeks did actually), analysing omirus epos (and not homers as you see everywhere), rhyme by rhyme. if i recall well it was iliada (iliad) on 8th grade and odysseia (odyssey) on 9th grade. warner's troy, was a big disappointment to me and my fellow greeks around the campus (i study in the uk).  iliad epos is one of the very best literature works ever made. it was composed by a greek poet omirus a whole 400 years after the actual war. historians put trojan war around 1200 bc, and the actual reason of the war not being helen's beauty but the strategically crucial position of troy. that said one may now understand that omirus epos is not presenting the actual events (as it's not accurate historically) but this was never the purpose of this work.   reading this huge poem, one can find himself wondering for the very definitions of honour, love, anger, hate, heroism, discipline, loyalty and so on. the best part and the most educational as well were these prolonged talks between the warriors before the battle. none of these though were revealed in 'troy'  warner's troy was really cheap to my eyes, and to other intellectual people english finnish and german colleagues of me as well. it is a shame to spend millions of dollars in such a bad scenario. by the way perfect storm was a bad and stupid blockbuster (computers graphics did the whole work), and yet it is wolfgang petersen's best work.   i conclude saying that you'd better watch something else instead. i would give troy 2 out of 10. it is a really expensive b movie.  cheers   alex",0

"since the start of her career in the 70's and vastly throughout the exuberant 80's, elvira (cassandra peterson) has grown into a modest icon and genuine cult figure in the world of horror & bad monster movies. while ms. peterson has taken on various supporting roles in motion pictures, covering a wide variety in genres, it was her tv-character elvira that brought her the most fame. part of her charm  and respect from the fans  lies in the fact she never turned her back on the horror genre that made her famous (unlike many other big name actors & actresses that like to distantiate themselves from their ""early"" work). i've seen only bits & pieces of her tv performances, but her cameo role in ghoultown's recent tribute song ""mistress of the dark"" really encouraged me to check out more of her stuff. one thing had been clear to me already long before this music video: over the years, elvira had become a force of influence herself by the time the mid-80's came around.  and in 1988, after films like ""fright night"" and ""terrorvision"" incorporated homages to and spoofs on her tv-work, it finally happened: ""elvira, mistress of the dark"", the motion picture. now, i had seen the trailer for it already back in the vhs rental days, but it took me until last week to finally see the actual film. a few years ago, i did manage to watch ""elvira's haunted hills"" (made in 2001), but for some reason it didn't impress me all that much. was it really that forgettable, or should i give it another watch? i actually really do feel like re-watching it now, as this first elvira film from '88 really convinced me. though perhaps partly responsible for making this film work, might be sam egan and john paragon with their contributions to the script, there really is no way to deny it: cassandra peterson has a great feel for comedy (she also co-wrote the screenplay).  when elvira learns she's one of the beneficiaries of a great aunt (she never heard of before), she takes it as the long cherished opportunity to start up her own show in las vegas. out to claim her rightfully inherited money, she travels to a quiet new england town. but the uptight townspeople of falwell are in for a treat. in less than no time she manages to shock and insult all noteworthy inhabitants of the conservative little town with her (often unintentionally) provocative behaviour. to make things worse, her inheritance turns out not to be what she expected: a rundown mansion, a cookbook and a poodle. but what she doesn't know, and her evil uncle vincent albot does, is that her great aunt was a witch, and the cookbook contains recipes to concoct the most hellishly dark powers imaginable. and if you haven't turned off the movie yet by the time elvira has cooked up her first dish from the recipe-book, then rest assured, you're going to sit out this ride with a smile on your face.  it's surprising how a script rigged together with boob-jokes, witty one-liners, movie references, inside jokes and bade taste merriment also manages to tell a coherent story. simple, of course, but coherent. while other movies, heavily relying on gag-like situations, often make you loose track of the story completely (like the ""naked gun"" films, for example), this film doesn't. a lot of horror-comedies were being produced during the 80's, but not a lot of them actually worked. let alone a horror-spoof that doesn't derail at some point (""killer party"", although i'm grateful for this one going completely bonkers during the finale) or becomes too tedious too quickly (""saturday the 14th""). although ""elvira"" is more comedy than horror, it doesn't loose track of what it's doing and consistently builds up towards a mildly grotesque finale, complete with a supernatural showdown in the streets of falwell between newborn witch elvira and evil uncle wizard talbot, including a real honest-to-god witch hunt and elvira's very own burn-at-the-stake moment.  i'm telling you, there's no power in hell that could make this movie unfunny. one of the first giggles i got was during the opening credits already, when daniel greene's name appeared. daniel who? oh yes, i recognized his name (and later on his dim-witted macho-face). how can one not forget daniel greene once you've seen... ""atomic cyborg aka fists of steel""! but if you haven't seen ""atomic cyborg"", then i'm sorry, but you won't be able to laugh with his face in this one. and on a side-note: i never could have imagined elvira looking this cool while ignorantly driving away from a gas station. even robert rodriguez could not have made that shot look any better.",1

"""hatred of a minute"" is arguably one of the better films to come out of michigan in recent years. not to say that it's a brilliant film by any means, but it's definitely worth a watch.   ""hatred"" chronicles the sordid adventures of eric seaver (played by director kallio), a formerly abused child now grown up, and starting to listen to his evil side.   ""hatred"" is very nice visually. the shots are creative, and the lighting is approporiately moody and interesting to look at. this film actually has an element of production value to it, unlike other recent michigan releases like ""dark tomorrow"" and ""biker zombies."" subtle dolly shots and stylized shot composition show good use of this film's $350,000 budget.   however, ""hatred"" stumbles in the same places that so many other local films do, and that's in the story and character department. essentially, things just kind-of happen. eric seaver doesn't evolve at all. basically, he's always been crazy, it's just that people are starting to notice. the film just wanders along its merry way with very little development. also, the ending is very abrupt.   however- since this is a horror film, since when do we care about plot? we just want to see people die, and ""hatred"" certainly delivers. as the body count mounted, people in the theater started cheering ""kill her! kill em' all!"" when people scream back at the screen, it's always fun.   that's the place where ""hatred"" succeeds. it's fun. and in the end, that's all that really matters.",1
"since was only a toddler when this show originally aired i just recently picked up the dvd set and am wishing there were more episodes filmed. this show was a 70s version of the poplular 90's tv series ""x-files""- but with a bit more of a comedic/light hearted approach. but don't get me wrong, some of these episodes have full on horror themes, many in which have some pretty greuesome plots (left to the imagination of course- this was the early 70s television).  some of the plots where a bit silly as well as the acting, but that is the charm and attraction to this series. whether you like mystery crime dramas, comedies, or sci-fi/horror themes, this series brought all that together. each episode clocked in at around 50 minutes or so (1 hour with commercials) and that 50 minutes goes by quick always leaving me wanting more. a great classic show that is underrated in my book!",1
"you can be fooled by your first impressions. as in, initial reactions to a movie, for example. as in, the first time i saw this movie i was bedazzled by the idea of it (first of all, i love black comedies). could even - despite being male, myself - empathise with the feisty girls' fervor to see their husbands deceased without delay. was tripped up by my own face-value (and, i do mean ""face-value"") response to nicolette sheridan and a couple of the other delicious dames in the picture. it just goes to show you that you've gotta step back from a situation sometimes and see that it's bad (and not ""bad good,"" either): the reason i'm giving this movie a ""4"" rating is because of ms sheridan and her gams (the rest of 'er is pretty good, too); but this movie has all the hallmark tv movie characteristics - which means you'll be disappointed if your a lover of movies made for the big screen. the story contains plot holes you could run a tunnel through - and i'll generally overlook holes in a plot if the overall thing does it for me; and i just experienced an incredible letdown the second time i saw it. i don't think it's a total waste of time, but....",0
"first love is a desperately difficult subject to pull off convincingly in cinema : the all-encompassing passion involved generally ends up as a pale imitation or, worse, slightly ridiculous.  lifshitz manages to avoid all the pitfalls and delivers a moving, sexy, thoroughly engrossing tale of love, disaster and possible redemption, while tangentially touching on some of the deeper themes in human existence.  the core story is of mathieu, 18, a solitary, introverted boy who meets cédric, brasher, more outgoing but just as lonely, while on holiday with his family. as the summer warms on, they fall in love and, when the holidays end, decide to live together. a year later, the relationship ends in catastrophe: cédric cheats on mathieu who, distraught, tries to take his own life. he survives and, in order to get perspective back on his life he returns to the seaside town where they first met, this time cloaked in the chill of winter.  if the tale was told like this it would never have the impact it does: much of it is implied, all of it happens non-sequentially.  the intricate narrative is essential to getting a deeper feeling of the passions experienced, through the use of counterpoint and temporal perspective. fortunately, the three time-lines used (the summer of love, the post-suicide psychiatric hospital and the winter of reconstruction) are colour coded: warm yellows and oranges for the summer, an almost frighteningly chill blue for the hospital scenes and warming browns and blues for the winter seaside.  both main actors put in excellent performances though, whilst it's a delight to see stéphane rideau (cédric) used to his full capacity (i'm more used to seeing him under-stretched in gael morel's rather limp dramas), jérémie elkaim (mathieu) has to be singled out for special mention: you can feel his loneliness, then his almost incredulous passion, then his character crumbling behind a wall of aphasia. beautifully crafted gestures get across far more than dialogue ever could.  the themes touched upon are almost classic in french cinema: our difficulty in really understanding what another is feeling; our difficulty in communicating fully; the shifting sands of meaning the film's title ""presque rien"" (almost nothing) points to all of these and, indeed, to one of the key scenes in the film: in trying to understand why mathieu attempted to kill himself, a psychiatrist asks cédric if he had ever cheated on him ""non enfin, oui une fois, mais ce n'était rien"" (no well, yes once, but it was nothing). cédric still loves mathieu  he brought him to the hospital during the suicide attempt (none of which we see) and tries desperately to contact him again once he leaves  but cannot understand that he has lost him forever, because something that seemed nothing to him (a meaningless affair) is everything to mathieu.  whilst the film is darker than the rather unfortunate pierre et gilles poster would suggest, it is not without hope: we get to see cédric's slow, painful attempts to get back in touch with life, first through a cat he adopts, then through work in a local bar and finally contact with pierre, who may be his next love. but here the story ends: a teenage passion, over within the year, another perhaps beginning. so what was it? almost nothing? certainly not when you're living it",1

"man, i really wanted to like these shows. i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these ""opportunites"". but, sadly, i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king. as brilliant as king's writing is, the irony is that it simply doesn't translate well to the screen, big or small. with few exceptions (very few), the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read. many people would disagree with this, but i'm sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read. the reason is simple. the average king story takes place in the mind-scape of the characters in the story. he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts, their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view. in short, king takes the reader places where you can't put a panavision camera. as an audience watching the filmed king, we're left with less than half the information than the reader has access to. it's not too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read, whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed. for as long as king writes, hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor, without any regard to whether or not they should. i don't blame the filmmakers for trying, but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works. the task is akin to turning lead into gold, or some arcane zen mastery. oh well, better luck next time.",0

"i am a student of film, and have been for several years. and the concept of a cyber, kung-fu, satirical chimpanzee had me wondering, ""is this the film that's going to break the mold?"" let's face it, america has never been let down by any piece of cinema that features a simian costar. after such great classics as ""monkey trouble"" and ""dunston checks in"", i thought that the best ideas were already taken. but then comes ""funky monkey"". i laughed, i cried, i contemplated suicide.  now i've read about demon possession in the bible, but that still doesn't explain why someone would create such a product of evil. first off, having at least a shred of intelligence, i realized that a chimpanzee was in fact an ape, not a monkey at all. however, i was sure that the filmmakers would clear this problem up further into the film. they didn't. let me sum up this work of art: a company by the name of z.i.t. has decided to train chimpanzees as soldiers. why? i think they mention something about the soldiers working for bananas, but when it would cost about an estimated 13 million dollars of government money to train one chimp, this doesn't seem cost-effective. well anyways, z.i.t. brings in a cia specialist (matthew modine) to train clemens (the chimp). clemens is everything z.i.t. hoped for. he can take out an entire shift of guards, who all appear to have gotten their training skills at the local mall, and yet still manage to remind us that we're watching a kid's movie. as you may have guessed, modine finds out that z.i.t.'s intentions may be evil (gasp!) and decides to break clemens out. being a cia agent and all, modine knows that best way to make himself disappear is to go to a large city, rent a guest room, regularly make appearances on television while fighting crime, and using checks to pay for everything.  z.i.t. finds out where modine is staying, and sends two of their finest to retrieve him. these guards are possibly the greatest comedy team up since martin and lewis, or was it turner and hooch? it doesn't matter anyways, because in the end, for a heck of a twist ending, the good guys win!!! yay! hooray for predictability! throw in a nerdy kid who learns to be himself, a lonely mom who needs a date, and music montages that feature songs that would even be blackballed by radio disney and you get ""funky monkey"". the climax to the movie? a football game! played by thugs, bumblers, a chimp, and the nerd boy. no one seems to care about such substitutions at a high school football game.  funky monkey never lets up! it's edge of your seat entertainment. some might even call this the ""american beauty"" of monkey-filled features. after finishing this epic, i recalled hearing a story about a railroad worker who lost much of his brain functions when a metal rod pierced his temporal lobe. funky monkey is a metal rod among movies.",0
"in nyc, seaman michael o'hara (orson welles) rescues elsa bannister (rita hayworth) from a mugging & rape as she takes a horse & carriage through central park -and lives to regret it. titian-haired hayworth's a platinum blonde in this one; as dazzling as fresh-fallen snow -but nowhere near as pure...  to reveal any more of the convoluted plot in this seminal ""noir"" would be criminal. it's as deceptive as the mirrors used to cataclysmic effect in the final scenes -but the film holds far darker secrets: from the ny times: ""childhood shadows: the hidden story of the black dahlia murder"" by mary pacios ""mary pacios, who was 5 years old when she was befriended by 15 year old bette short, retraces short's steps, interviewing friends and associates. she also offered a detailed, if speculative, analysis of orson welles -particularly in regard to his movie ""the lady from shanghai"". according to ms. pacios, the movie, along with related archival materials, has many of the same ritualistic elements associated with short's murder. she raises the question: could welles have been the killer?"" interesting theories -and with the spate of books now out on ""the black dahlia"", much more may come to light. fritz lang's brutal ""film noir"", ""the big heat"" (1953), was a roman-a-clef telling of the ""dahlia"" killing in ""the city of nets"" that was l.a. -but it's the orson opus that the ""dahlia"" had a ""hands-on"" connection to. in reality, it was bugsy siegel (and the hollywood mob wars of the 1940's) that did the ""dahlia"" in ...but that doesn't negate much of what pacios wrote. almost all of hollywood intersected with elizabeth (""the black dahlia"") short and her tale/aura/legacy/curse is encoded in a number of golden age films.  the ""black dahlia"" was always on the peripheral edges of ""shanghai""-even before it started filming. barbara payton on franchot tone: ""it was when he was thinking about making ""the lady from shanghai"", before he lost the option to orson welles. franchot said he'd been in a bad state over that deal when he ran into the dahlia in the formosa cafe* across from the goldwyn studios..."" *the floor above the formosa cafe was bugsy siegel's office and ""the dahlia"" one of his on again/off again working ""girls"".  it gets deeper and darker- after the 1951 brawl over barbara payton between tom neal and franchot tone that sent franchot to the hospital with a concussion and ""never talking the same way again,"" barbara said, she married tone ""just to spite neal."" tom (""detour"") neal also knew ""the dahlia"" (who didn't?) and became obsessed- from ""l.a. despair"" by john gilmore: ""the january 1947 slaying of the young, beautiful would-be actress elizabeth short, known as ""the black dahlia"", was one of the most grisly murders in the annals of modern crime. a project, called ""who killed the black dahlia?"" was being kicked off by actor tom neal, a hell-raiser from ww ii movies. potential producer gene harris: ""someone will have to come up with a more imaginative business proposition than what has been presented by tom neal and his cohorts..."" not long after: ""it would be very clear one beautiful day to come, when tom would sneak up on his pretty, new palm springs wife as she lay on their sofa and shoot a .45 bullet through her head."" barbara payton and norma jean dougherty (later marilyn monroe) knew the ""dahlia"" and their stories are well known. it seems all who crossed the path of the ""dahlia"" (like the proverbial black cat) entered a ""twilight zone"" darkness and/or had an incredible string of bad luck afterward. tone/neal/welles are only a few -and this includes a butchered film called ""the lady from shanghai""...  ""lady from shanghai"" took two years to be released, thanks to extensive re-editing -and all because columbia president harry cohn couldn't understand the story. it's dark ""noir"" to be sure -one of the darkest, in fact. it's also a wicked satire on life in the new atomic age.  nicolas christopher:  ""shanghai"" pushes forth an insistent subtext of nuclear apocalypse and contains the definitive noir statement concerning the atomic bomb and the american city. the film's principal murder victim (and there are many), a psychotic and double-dealing lawyer, manically foresees armageddon at every turn, claiming he can ""feel it."" he announces that he plans to escape to a remote pacific island -a particularly acid joke on welles' part since this was the very year the u.s. began testing atomic bombs at just such a place, the bikini atoll, relocating all the inhabitants and destroying the ecosystem. by the time of bikini, the erotic identification of hayworth with the bomb appears to have been institutionalized, with the blessing of the military brass; the first bomb dropped in the pacific testing ground in named ""gilda"" and has hayworth's image, in provocative dress, painted directly on its casing...""   its ironic that orson welles' broad interpretation of an irishman is considered a detriment to the film by many. welles is giving a clue to viewers that ""michael o'hara"" is only the storyteller - not part of the story even though it revolves around him. ""o'hara"" contradicts the shark motif throughout the film. sharks on a feeding frenzy won't stop until there's nothing left. ""michael o'hara"" lives to tell the tale. ""elsa bannister"" causes a feeding frenzy during ""o'hara's"" trial and her netted chapeau suggests she's caged in -so as not to devour the human spectators to a roman coleseum. the spectators are on a feeding frenzy of their own, gossiping and carrying on about ""elsa"" -a human aquarium correlating to the san francisco marine museum sequence. that's the human condition ...except for ""michael o'hara"". and yet he'll be spending his life trying to forget his past (""elsa"") -or die trying. ""elsa"" is part of ""michael"" and the tale eats its own tail in the end and the viewer is cautioned to stay out of trouble.",1
"after seeing ""driven"" on a plane flight to america 3 years ago i truly believed i had seen the worst film ever created, and i could relax safe in the knowledge i would never have to suffer that much in front of a screen ever again. unfortunately as i found out last night this was not the case. revolver is so monstrously bad i am actually thinking about recommending friends to go and see it, just so i don't feel like i'm the only one stupid enough for being conned into watching this. its really quite amazing how much this film falls completely on its face with the constant, and i mean constant voice overs of the main characters, with totally inane pretentious nonsense! i was actually getting angry in the cinema listening to andre benjamin's utterly relentless droning for what seemed like half the film, whilst all the time thinking - what would turkish have done to this complete joke of gangster/con man, whatever he's supposed to be, when he made his ""offer""? i'll tell you what. he would have told him to f**k off, blown his head away, and watch with utter disdain as his equally inept partner waddles away as fast as his chubby little legs would carry him. i mean what are we supposed to believe is going through jake's head when they offer him their ""solution"" to his problem? they're con men, therefore they must obviously also have the skill to cure incurable blood diseases! i mean ffs. doesn't he start to wonder why his symptoms aren't getting worse? doesn't the penny drop on the third day what is happening instead of richie subjecting the audience to a painfully patronising phone call from avi to jake to let him know he's been conned.   anyway, i can add a small positive note to the film by moving on to the dry humour if provides, thankfully of a similar standard to his previous films. bulls**t! this film doesn't try anything as smart as redeeming itself through some well timed amusing lines, oh no. it somehow managed to be so disastrously unfunny i genuinely didn't hear so much as a titter from a completely packed cinema  and anyone who knows the ugc in sheffield knows how full a main screen can get, and not 1 person so much as smiled. maybe he never wanted the film to be funny, and fair enough you can still make good gangster films without comedy, but what was he planning on hanging this film on may i ask? the unnecessarily baffling plot!?? i sincerely hope not!  by far the most satisfying moment i went through last night was hearing the very loud sighing coming from all directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the film to end. it was also really quite amusing watching just how fast patrons were fighting and dashing for the exits after they realised it was over, and they were free from their torment!  i'll round this off (i've got to finish, writing this is making me angry again) by elaborating on the ""end"". i mean sh**t! the ending.. no, sorry i can't, your just going to have to go and see it. it can't be put in words, it just can't, and after you've seen it you'll know why. uuhhhhh  shudders ",0

"i can understand why some people like this movie, and why some people don't. for me, though, i really like it, even if i noticed some good bits, and not so impressive bits. the animation was actually excellent, like charlie's dream. the characters were a mixed bag, the best being anne-marie, voiced by the late judith barsi.(i was physically ill when i read what happened to her) also, carface is a very convincing villain,especially voiced by the wonderful vic tayback(i particularly loved ""morons i'm surrounded by morons"") and along with rasputin and warren t.rat is probably the most memorable of all the don bluth villains. charlie and itchy only just lacked the same sparkle, but i loved king gator and his song. some of the film is very haunting, like annabelle's ""you can never come come back"", which kind of scares me still. unfortunately, there were some bits i didn't like so much. the story had a tendency to become clumsy and unfocused, but disney's black cauldron suffered from the same problem. also there were some dark scenes, that young children would find upsetting, but the ending is very poignant. however the biggest flaw was the rather bland songs and the way they were sung. none of them in particular stick out, with exception of ""let's make music together"" and ""love survives"", and burt reynolds can't sing and dom deluise has done much better singing. all in all, a watchable movie, that could have been more, but is definitely memorable, and i would definitely watch it again. 7/10. bethany cox",1
"this movie has no plot, no character development, and no budget. it really sucks to put it in short terms. since there is no development for the movie, it really can't even be looked as trying to be artistic or trying to make a statement against torture. which leaves two other reasons to possibly watch it. to be shocked or to get off on it like a sick little freak. well it falls short here too. the girl's reactions just seem dumb. it's extremely easy to tell that it's fake (honestly professional wrestling looks more realistic than the crap they try to get by with in this movie. they throw innards on her, but she's asleep for most of it, so it's just kinda dumb. the only really kind of worthwhile part is the end when they quickly cut from scene to scene just before the needle goes into her eye. but honestly the girl is extremely ugly and everything is incredibly fake, with the exception of the eye. if you want a good movie about torture, go watch hostel and hostel 2. not only do they both contain realistic violence, but there is also an actual storyline that draws you in and makes you care about the people. plus the tow movies really work on a deeper level considering themes like american fears of foreigners, issues of morality, testing how far a person can go, human instincts vs. civilization, and many other things. plus they are carefully written and contain some good humor when the story isn't focused on the violence. these are much better choices over this piece of crap",0

david duchovny plays the lead role in this film.now a lot of people upon finding that fact out wouldn't even bother watching it.very unfair to say the least.david made his name on the x-files and is a decent actor. dr eugene sands(duchovny)is a drug addicted doctor struck off for malpractice.by sheer accident he becomes a private doctor for criminal millionaire raymond blossom.however the fbi take an interest in using eugene to snare blossom. angelina jolie is cast in the supporting role of clare-the gangsters moll.she puts in a solid performance. timothy hutton playing blossom is superb and immersed himself deeply into his character. duchovny himself isn't as bad as many people would think and in the end i would rate his performance his credible.his familiar monotonous tone and straight face is present but dosen't detract too much from the film,1
"your mind will not be satisfied by this nobudget doomsday thriller; but, pray, who's will? a youngish couple spends the actual end of the world in the hidden laboratory of some aliens masquerading as church people.  small _apocalyptically themed outing, end of the world has the ingenuity and the lack of both brio and style of the purely '50s similar movies. and it's not only that, but eotw plays like a hybridnot only doomsday but convent creeps as well. the villain of the movie is a wellknown character actor.  this wholly shameless slapdash seems a piece of conventexploitation, that significantly '70s genre which looks today so amusingly outdated. anyway, the convent's secret laboratory is some nasty piece of futuristic deco! christopher lee is the pride of end of the world; but the end of the world is not at all his pride!",0
"this movie is just so awful. so bad that i can't bear to expend anything other than just a few words. avoid this movie at all costs, it is terrible.  none of the details of the crimes are re-enacted correctly. lots of slaughterhouse footage. weird cuts and edits. no continuity to the plot. the acting is absolutely the most amateur i have ever seen.  this bomb of a movie was obviously made to make some money without any regard to the accuracy of it's content. the camera work is out of focus at times and always shaky. it looks as if it was shot on video.  in fact, now that they've got dennis rader with life in prison, i wish they would put the guys that made this horrible movie into prison as well.  seriously, don't even think about watching this one. i'd give it a negative star if i could.",0

"ah, noir. my favourite genre. otto preminger's follow-up to ""laura"" is a film noir set in a postwar new york, where corruption and violence run rampant. it stars dana andrews as sergeant mark dixon, a detective whose brutal tactics have landed him in hot water with his superiors.   when he accidentally kills a murder suspect, dixon tries to pin the blame on crime boss tommy scalese. dixon is close to achieving his goal when he becomes involved with the dead man's wife, the beautiful morgan taylor. of course, in typical noir fashion, things quickly go down hill.  while the film does nothing interesting camera or narrative wise, it does have a constant tone of dread and gloom. like most great noirs, it is also wonderfully paced, sucking the viewer in right from the start.  still, like most of preminger's workmanlike films, it's not something i'd watch again. it lacks the verbal wit of wilder, the visual flamboyance of hitchcock or the spatial experimentation of welles. like lang's later work, ""sidewalk"" feels very much a ""clone"" of what a noir should be, instead of something really artistically genuine.   thematically the film is nothing special. it's about a cop who finds himself slowly becoming a criminal. in one scene dixon explains that his father himself was a small time crook, the film flirting with the notion of predestination, but this one scene is as far as otto goes, or dares to take his ideas.  the camera work is likewise disappointing. there's no intelligence in otto's camera. no effort is made to assign the camera to anything. it doesn't play with space or architecture or empahsise the step-by-step police procedural. it's just tripod set ups with the occasional dolly in and out. meaningless, though most people don't care about these things.   there is, however, one good shot where our hero is trapped in a car full of gangsters (noir cage) which itself enters a vehicle-lift (another cage) and is taken up into the chief gangster's lair. like lynch's ""blue velvet"", otto retopologizes the film, constantly likens ""upstairs"" to hell. this works well, but the set design fails to reinforce it.   7/10 - otto seems content to follow the hawksian mould of what a noir is, rather than toy with the possibilities of where noir can go. like ""detour"", ""night in the city"", ""scarlet street"", ""in a lonely place"", ""act of violence"", ""bomberang"" and ""johnny eager"", ""where the sidewalk ends"" is one of those well made second tier film noirs. it's competent and engaging, but lacks that extra special magic.",1
"first time of seeing buster keaton's first feature film and i have to admit i liked it a lot and only wish i'd stumbled across it years ago. the rohauer blurb at the start warns that the three ages single nitrate print was rediscovered and salvaged in 1954 just in time before combustion, and many frames that seemed hopelessly glued together were separated. so, it's rocky viewing in places, but i've seen and survived much worse.  it would have been ok as the 3 short films but as a take on intolerance it's inventive and funny from the start to the finish: in the stone age with baddie wallace beery riding an elephant and goodie buster riding a pet brontosaurus; in the roman age buster riding a chariot with wheel locks and adapted for sledging, no parking signs in latin; in this technological age of speed need and greed his car beautifully falls to bits at the first hump. both him and beery are after the girl through the ages, a never ending tussle. favourite bit: as the caveman he gets knocked backward over a cliff edge but still blows a kiss to the camera - an amazing second or two!  great stuff, reaffirming my love of silent film comedy.",1
"""the grudge"" is a remake of shimizu's own series of popular japanese horror films. shimizu knows he is not dealing with anything new, so he does what any intelligent person would have done in his place: he forgets logic and concentrates in giving viewers a fun ride. he uses commonly known clichés associated with ghost stories but shimizu plays with these elements in an imaginative manner. the nonlinear narrative is not a mere gimmick but an interesting way to present sequences from different perspectives. at the end, all i can say is that if the only purpose of a horror film is to scare the audience (the same way a comedy is to make people laugh), this movie succeeded with flying colors. i watched it in a theater with an audience and it was fun to see viewers go wild over this one. it probably doesn't play as well in your living room.",1

there is no doubt that this film has an impressive cast but unfortunately this doesn't help with the major downsides to the movie. i never understand why directors ask actors/actresses to use accents not their own when it is obvious to everyone they can't convince. fiennes just can't do irish and fitzgerald isn't much better at russian. when the voice is wrong then no matter how good the acting the character will never be convincing. as the for the major problem....the plot....was there one? i guess there was some sort of storyline involved but it was so full of holes that i just couldn't wait for the film to end...it was ridiculous. save 90 minutes of your life and don't watch this movie!,0

"even if this film was allegedly a joke in response to critics it's still an awful film. if one is going to commit to that sort of thing at least make it a good joke.....first off, jeroen krabbé is i guess the poor man's gerard depardieu.....naturally i hate gerard depardieu even though he was very funny in the 'iron mask' three musketeer one. otherwise to me he is box office poison and jeroen krabbé is worse than that. the poor man's box office poison....really that is not being fair to the economically disenfranchised. if the '4th man' is supposed to be some sort of critique of the bourgeoisie....what am i saying? it isn't. let's just say hypothetically, if it was supposed to be, it wasn't sharp enough. satire is a tricky thing....if it isn't sharp enough the viewer becomes the butt of the joke instead......i think that is what happened. the story just ends up as a bunch of miserable disgusting characters doing nothing that anyone would care about and not in an interesting way either.....(for a more interesting and worthwhile application see any luis bunuel film....very sharp satire)  [potential spoiler alert]  really, the blow job in the cemetery that jeroen krabbé's character works so so hard to attain.... do you even care? is it funny? since mr. voerhoven is supposed to be a good film maker i will give him the benefit of the doubt and assume it was some misanthropic joke that got out of control.....though i'm guessing he didn't cast jeroen krabbé because he's the worst actor and every character he's played has been a pretentious bourgeois ass.... except he's incompetent at it. so it becomes like a weird caricature. do you think mr. voerhoven did that on purpose? and jeroen krabbé is the butt of the joke as well? i just don't see it...... so you understand the dilemma i'm faced with here right? it is the worst film ever because he's supposed to be a good director. so there is some kind of dupery involved. i knew 'patch adams' was horrible without even seeing it. do not be duped by 'the 4th man""s deceptively alluring packaging or mr. voerhoven's reputation as a good director etc. etc.",0
"although i'm grateful this obscure gem of 70's italian exploitation cinema features in the recently released ""grindhouse experience"" box set, and although it's also available on disc under the misleading and stupid alternate title ""escape from death row"", i honestly think it deserves a proper and luxurious dvd edition, completely in its originally spoken languages with subtitle options (the dubbing is truly horrible), restored picture quality and a truckload of special bonus features! heck, i don't even need the restored picture quality and bonus features if only we could watch the film in its original language. ""mean frank and crazy tony"" is a cheerfully fast-paced mafia/crime flick with a lot of violence, comedy (which, admittedly, doesn't always work), feminine beauty and two witty main characters. tony lo bianco is terrific as the small thug pretending to be the city's biggest don. when the real crime lord frankie dio (lee van cleef) arrives in town, he sees an opportunity to climb up the ladder by offering his services. frankie initially ignores the little crook, but they do eventually form an unlikely team when frankie's entire criminal empire turns against him and a new french criminal mastermind even assassinates frankie's innocent brother. tony helps frankie to escape from prison and together they head for marseille to extract frankie's revenge. the script of this sadly neglected crime gem funnily alters gritty action & suspense with light-headed bits of comedy, like the grotesque car chase through the narrow french mountain roads for example. the build up towards the typical mafia execution sequences (guided by an excellent riz ortolani score) are extremely tense and the actual killings are sadistic and merciless, which is probably why the film is considered to be somewhat of a grindhouse classic. the film lacks a strong female lead, as the lovely and amazingly voluptuous beauty edwige fenech sadly just appears in a couple of scenes, and then still in the background. on of the men behind the camera, responsible for the superb cinematography, was no less then joe d'amato. great film, highly recommended to fans of italian exploitation, and i hope to watch it again soon in its original version.",1

"what keeps us going - or at least what i feel the writer wanted us to keep us glued at an early point is our desire to know whether martinaud has done the dirty deed. without spoiling so much, of course there is a red herring and a twist. but then we discover that this is the story of martinaud's imperfections and his difficulty in coping. when there is the revelation - we begin to sympathize and pity him because as the story progresses we are made to think he is the sick, perverted pedophiliac that we're predisposed to have in mind. one of those things he has to cope with is the distant gap he and his wife have even though they live on the same roof. these problems of course are given their denouement in the film's shocking finale.  this movie demands your patience and it has certainly tried those of restless teenagers sitting at the rear. they were heckling obviously because they aren't partial to ""central location"" films. although there is a bit of travelling, when we get to the woods and the beach. and we realize that gallien isn't as clever as we are made to think he is.  the inquisitor is 5/5",1

"""cypher"" is a cleverly conceived story about industrial espionage set in america in the not too distant future. while thematically not complex, this film does offer many different perspectives about personal loyalty, ruthlessness, and corporate conspiracy. to a certain extent this film also attempts to represent modern corporate groups and companies as being indifferent to the risks their contract employees take on their behalf.  the film starts off with a somewhat mediocre salary man, morgan sullivan (jeremy northam), who applies to the digicorp group to work as an undercover operative. after an initial briefing with digicorp's security chief, sullivan is then given a new identity (jack thursby) and sent to a business conference with the task of recording the speeches given by various spokesmen concerning the marketing strategies of each of their respective companies. upon successfully completing his first assignment, sullivan/thursby is sent on further missions to obtain the same type of information previously gathered. however, on one of his ""business trips"" he inadvertently runs into a woman named rita foster, (liu) whom he had met on his previous assignment, and from there things go extremely topsy-turvy. the implications of a diabolical conspiracy involving digicorp's espionage program begin to emerge and sullivan is forced to go deep cover at one of digicorp's main competitors, thus becoming a double agent involved in an intense rivalry between the two companies.  ((spoilers end here))  what i liked most about this film was the efficient use of lighting and shadows in a lot of the scenes. vivid lighting was used in mainly domestic/household settings, while a lot of shadows and dark coloring were used for settings involving deception and cover-up. i was also very impressed with jeremy northam. not too often have i seen him in the lead role, and the fact that he plays a disenchanted married man straight out of wisconsin was brilliant. personally, i think he's one of the many under used actors in the industry who hasn't been given more challenging roles. lucy liu was also incredible in her part and gave the movie its real cloak-and-dagger tone. additionally, the rest of the supporting cast did a superb job, however, my only complaint was that some characters could have been explored more to make the plot and closure a little more complicated. for example, i would have loved to see what would have happened if jack thursby had developed a more intimate relationship with his second ""wife."" overall, this is a cleverly developed cloak-and-dagger story that keeps you guessing to the very end about personal and professional loyalties and whether anyone in the entire film can be trusted. with a smart and stylish soundtrack and great camera work, this film provides a scary look at how corporations might operate in the near future. i'm surprised that i had never watched this ""hidden gem"" before. this is a brilliant, not-too-overly complicated spy thriller, and therefore i'm giving it a 9 out of 10.",1

"i had heard this film was a study of a landscape photographer's art by presenting the beauty in man's deconstructing the natural landscape. it certainly showed the laborious activities to find locations, setup shots, and capture stark images whose final destinations were art studios worldwide. put together in moving pictures it is truly a horror show.  this film oozes by you supplanting the shock of ghastly images with gentle waves of a wonderful industrial soundtrack that guides you like on slow moving river. each sequence stands on its own, but in combination you get deeper and deeper into the feeling of overwhelming inevitability. there are few words, this allowing the grandeur in what is shown to preach in its own way. an awful, massive factory filled with human automata who live in hopelessly lifeless dormitories. individuals dying early while rummaging for recyclable scraps in mountains of our e-waste. the birthing of gigantic ships and their destruction by hand in giant graveyards. the construction of the three gorges dam, the largest industrial project in human history and likely for all time. the time lapse as a city dies and is simultaneously reborn into a replica of modernity that purposefully destroys all relics of the culture that was.  the most terrifying image for me was a dam engineer explaining that the most important function of the dam was flood control. the shot shifts to the orchard behind the spokesperson where you witness the level of the last flood by the toxic water having eaten the bark from the trees, demonstrating that nothing but the most hideous vermin could be living in the waters.  the obvious not being stated is far more powerful than your normal preachy save the earth documentaries. the artist edward burtynsky explains the method wonderfully. 'by not saying what you should see  many people today sit in an uncomfortable spot where you don't necessarily want to give up what we have but we realize what we're doing is creating problems that run deep. it is not a simple right or wrong. it needs a whole new way of thinking'. the subtlety of this descends into an either/or proposition, but the film images scream that the decision has very much been made in favor of the dark side.  though never stated directly in any way, as the waves of what you witness wash away from your awareness and you contemplate, there is only one conclusion possible  we are doomed. the progress of mankind that is inexorable from our natures leaves behind carnage that this artist finds terrifying beauty in. what he is actually capturing are the tracks of we the lemmings rushing unconsciously toward our own demise. unlike most films with environmental themes, this one ends with no call to arms. it argues basically what's the point, but makes certain you place the blame properly on all of us equally.",1
"amy heckerling's second film johnny dangerously is a parody of 1930's gangster films made in the warner brothers' tradition. michael keaton stars as a middle aged gangster looking back at his life of hard knocks when he catches a kid trying to steal something from his pet store in 1935. keaton's mother (maureen stapleton) has continuing health problems, so keaton falls into crime at an early age via peter boyle. meanwhile, the fargan richard dimitri plays a rival crime lord to boyle and keaton eventually rises through the ranks. joe piscopo has a hilarious turn as danny vermin, yeah that's right, vermin! griffin dunne is keaton's younger brother turned district attorney, glynnis o'connor his wife, and marilu henner plays keaton's moll. the film looks notoriously cheap, making it seem like a television show instead of a theatrical film.  the film starts out great and then slows down as expected after the first half hour. due to the combination of dialog and gags, the film holds its own for the first half, but then it rapidly loses steam and descends into mediocrity and vulgarity in the second half. keaton chews the scenery doing his best james cagney impression. stapleton has several vulgar lines that are only obnoxious, not funny. piscopo does the ""once"" bit one time too many. several supporting actors try to hold up the fort like danny devito, dom deluise, ray walston as a street vendor, alan hale, jr. as a desk sergeant, and sudie bond as an unscrupulous cleaning lady. the second half evolves into a hit or miss television show type tone and never recovers. the closing scene utilizing the roaring twenties is an anachronism as is the call of the wild clark gable film seen on a marquee earlier in the film. i think heckerling should have known better, since the targeted audience would certainly be aware of the roaring twenties' actual 1939 release date. *1/2 of 4 stars.",0

"i usually check out the mtv movie awards to watch a witty, entertaining show that delivers a unique award show (chewbacca winning a life-time achievement award as example). so this year was no different. while i'm not a fan of justin timberlake, seann william scott has always been funny-albiet stupid-to me. i've laughed at stiffler in both american pie movies, and even enjoyed him in dude where's my car?. but the mtv movie awards were simply horrible. nothing was coherrent, humorous, or entertaining. justin timberlake should stick to singing and dancing; he sure as hell can't act.  i'm curious as to who the writers were for this show. last year's performance by jack black and sarah michelle gellar was extremly funny (the lord of the rings parody alone was worth watching the entire show), but this year was completly different. did anyone understand timberlake's comments regarding luke wilson and kate hudson (""they're staring in a movie together, but have never met! here they are..."") where was the joke? kate and luke just went into their lame dialogue, never making a reference to the ""joke"" by timberlake. and seann was completly wasted as a talent, not even causing me to smile, yet alone laugh. and what was the point of harrison ford's one-liners? did they make any sense to anyone? perhaps the mtv writers figured the young viewers would only know the aging ford as han solo, indiania jones, or the president from air force one. i'm baffled. and would someone tell me the deal with adrian brody? how old is this guy and how old does he think he is? the guy looks 30, trying to act 19 again....give it up, show some class (like in your best actor academy award speech) and act your age!  i give this show 1 star out of 4, simply because of the speech by gollam for best visual performance. this was very creative, extremely well done, and caused the only genuine laugh of the entire evening.",0
"i wasn't expecting this to be a great movie, but neither was i expecting it to be so awful. i hated the mother character so much i had to turn the channel. i turned it back, hoping it was just one part of the movie, but no. and for the daughter to sit there take being embarrassed, or almost done out of a job, or driven to madness inside her own home? are you kidding me? i was raised to respect (and even fear) my mother but i'd put her up fast in the nearest hotel if she proved that annoying in my house. i was expected to follow a set of rules in my mother's house, after all.  i didn't buy any of it. i tried giving it several chances, i really did. sorry.",0
"when i first saw this film in the 1980's, i was in my middle teenage years and somewhat reluctant to see this since i considered myself grown up and out of the ""sesame street/muppets"" age. i honestly don't remember if i liked it at the time or not. however, somewhere in college i watched this film again, and it wound up going (and staying) into my personal best films ever collection.  this film is loaded with humor that goes far above and beyond what one would have expected from the muppets. i mean, obviously the muppets always have appealed to adults and children because there's humor geared towards both generations. but come on...janice is accidentally overheard telling someone ""i don't take my clothes off for anyone, even if it is artistic""...there's a joke from a father to a son that if the son in love with kermit the frog then the father doesn't want to hear it...gonzo saves a chicken with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation (sp?) and afterwards says ""i think we're engaged now""...these and plenty of other moments in the film had me rolling. add to that very smart dialogue, very smart new york/broadway ""wink wink"" humor, the usual large amount of celebrity cameos and some really enjoyable songs that don't border on ""kid-level cheesy"" whatsoever...this film is a masterpiece! i don't throw ""10""'s out on a regular basis...but this one deserves it. over 20 years later, this film totally holds up, perhaps even more so. the muppets never were and never will be again, as funny and smart and just plain brilliant as this film was and is. ---q",1
"trying to cash in on the success of deal or no deal and 1 versus 100 comes this lame excuse for entertainment - show me the money, in which 12 sexy 'dancers' shimmy out in shiny red hooker attire. a contestant is given the beginning of a phrase, such as ""which team lost . . ."" with three choices, a, b, or c, each which completes the phrase. the contestant has three chances to give an answer to one of these 3 choices. the host - william shatner, at his obnoxious smarmiest - asks the contestant if he wants to ""lock into the answer"" and when the contestant says yes, he picks a 'dancer', to whom he yells ""show me the money!"" she opens a scroll that has an amount, and if his answer was right, he adds that amount to his winnings; if he was wrong, the amount is subtracted. (so theoretically, it is possible for a contestant on this dreary debacle to actually wind up owing shatner money.) there is also a ""killer card"" and if the contestant picks the girl who has that vile scroll, but he has answered properly, nothing happens. if he's answered wrong, the game goes into sudden death and has to answer another question. if he gets that one wrong, he leaves with nothing.  before going to commercials, shatner yells, ""let's dance"" and shatner, the contestant and the 12 dancers shake booty. at the end of the show, shatner asks the ladies for ""a last dance"" and they all shake it some more.  i give this show 6 episodes at the very most, at which time hopefully this pathetic excuse for a game will be shown the door. (it could've been worse - they could've somehow bribed cuba gooding jr to be the host, although i bet he's a better dancer than 'shat,' as they call him these days.)  7/08: guess what - i was wrong! it lasted for only 5 episodes. there is hope for the world.",0
"this is another typical unbelievable and non-sensical piece of hollywood dreck.  kurt russell, as snake pliskin in a business suit, convinces me he was a better 2nd baseman. ray liotta as the psychotic cop is totally predictable and absurd. madeline stowe is her usual cardboard self, and does little to be a convincing victim.  every scene in this persiflage is absolutely predictable all the way to the end when kurt clouts ray with a vase or something, knocking him down and out. kurt and madeline then do their obligatory end-of-the-movie embrace, and everybody--- except russell and stowe, knows liotta is going to get back up and menace the couple again.  he does, of course, and russell drills him 10 times with his 9mm, which was entirely unnecessary. this movie could just as well ended with the bludgeoning scene--- except hollywood dotes on unnecessary violence, and the more they can add, or ""enhance"", the more slobbery they get.",0
"there is a scene in dan in real life where the family is competing to see which sex can finish the crossword puzzle first. the answer to one of the clues is murphy's law: anything that can go wrong, will go wrong. this is exactly the case for dan burns (steve carell, the office) a columnist for the local newspaper. dan is an expert at giving advice for everyday life, yet he comes to realize that things aren't so picture perfect in his own. dan in real life is amazing at capturing these ironies of everyday life and is successful at embracing the comedy, tragedy, and beauty of them all. besides that this movie is pretty damn hilarious.  the death of his wife forces dan to raise his three daughters all on his own... each daughter in their own pivotal stages in life: the first one anxious to try out her drivers license, the middle one well into her teenage angst phase, and the youngest one drifting away from early childhood. things take a turn for dan when he goes to rhode island for a family reunion and stumbles across an intriguing woman in a bookstore.  her name is marie (juliette binoche, chocolat) and she is looking for a book to help her avoid awkward situations... which is precisely whats in store when they get thrown into the burns family household.  if you've seen steve carell in the office or little miss sunshine, you'd know that he is incomparable with comedic timing and a tremendously dynamic actor as well. steve carell is awesome at capturing all the emotions that come with family life: the frustration and sincere compassion. the family as well as the house itself provides a warm environment for the movie that contrasts the inner turmoil that builds throughout the movie and finally bursts out in a pretty suspenseful climax. the movie only falls short in some of the predictable outcomes, yet at the same time life is made up of both irony and predictability: which is an irony within itself.  dan in real life is definitely worth seeing, for the sole enjoyment of watching all the funny subtleties we often miss in everyday life, and i'll most likely enjoy it a second time, or even a third. just ""put it on my tab.""",1
"if the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music, they succeeded with me. commonplace human situations became original, personal and immediate so that i personally felt touched by each situation. i believe i would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie. without spoiling, i can say that i was very moved by the movie's approach to living. haven't actually cried out of-what- joy? empathy? just deep emotion? in a very long time. i would love to find a way to show it to others. saw it at seattle international film festival.",1
"a friend gave it to me saying it was another classic like ""debbie does dallas"". nowhere close. i think my main complaint is about the most unattractive lead actress in porn industry ever. even more terrible is that she is on screen virtually all the time. but i read somewhere that back in those days, porn had to have some ""artistic"" value. i was unable to find it though. see it only if you are interested in history of development of porn into mainstream, or can appreciate art in porn movies. i know i am not. but the director of the movie appears to be a talented person. he even tried to get simon & garfunkel to give him permissions to use his songs. of course, they rejected.",0

"despite some reviews being distinctly luke-warm, i found the story totally engrossing and even if some critics have described the love story as 'mills and boon', so what? it is good to see a warm, touching story of real love in these cynical times. many in the audience were sniffing and surreptitiously dabbing their eyes. you really believe that the young victoria and albert are passionately fond of each other, even though, for political reasons, it was an arranged marriage. i did feel though that sir john conroy, who was desperate to control the young queen, is perhaps played too like a pantomime villain. as it is rumoured that he was in fact, the real father of victoria (as a result of an affair with her mother the duchess of kent) it would have been interesting to explore this theory. emily blunt is totally convincing as the young princess, trapped in the stifling palace with courtiers and politicians out to manipulate her. she brilliantly portrays the strength of character and determination that eventually made victoria a great queen of england, which prospered as never before, under her long reign. i believe word of mouth recommendations will ensure great success for this most enjoyable and wonderful looking movie.",1
"fulci experiments with sci fi and fails. usually in his non horror films we still get sum great gore, but not here. sum very funny scenes like when the prisinors are forced to hold onto a bar for 12 minutes and if they drop they are electecuted. the guy falls and and has some kind of fit on the floor for about two minutes until his friends who were struggling to hold on anyway lift him off the floor. the city is an obvious model but not a bad one. and the end explosion is at best laughable. and dont get me started on the terrible battle scenes.  4/10",0

the story line was very straight forward and easy to follow and contained a lot of no-brainer comedy to a point where it just got boring. some of the audience seemed to find it funny but i like more intelligent humor.  there were several known swedish actors in the movie and their performance were decent considering the script. lena endre was good looking as always.  i don't remember the original movie so i can't say if it's better or worse.  if you enjoy movies like sällskapsresan this movie might be worth taking a look at.,0

"i saw this film in a london cinema in 1975 and have not seen it since. i found it hilarious. i loved it's originality. it's rare that someone makes a movie like this - and it's sad too.  what i mean is, i once read a book called ""the black hotel"" - and as a film-fan, i always ""picture"" books as films. kinda ""adapt"" them, you know? but as i read it, i thought, well, this would make a great movie - but of course it would have to be ""adapted"" - to the point where it would bear little relationship to the book.  but then i thought, well why? sure, it could never be shown on sunday afternoon tv, but provided it were shown in cinemas to adults, who knew what it contained, where's the harm? dammit, my civil liberties were being crushed here. a director should be able to make a literal film adaptation of ""the black hotel"".  in an ideal world, censorship of films for adults should not exist. but sadly, whilst i accept that with intelligent adults, such freedom might be harmless, there would always be those who would lack the rationality to differentiate between fantasy and reality, and who might be spurred on to commit foul deeds.  however, it's hard to see how ""la bete"" falls into that category.  on it's appearance in england, the british censor dismissed it out of hand. despite the '69 relaxation on nudity, given the film's theoretical theme of bestiality, had the censor passed any of it, he'd have been looking for a new job on monday.  but... in those days, there was an alternative. the g.l.c. this was a local town council with a department who had the power to pass a film just for london, where it was deemed audiences were more ""sopisticated"" than those who lived out in the sticks.  the film was duly submitted and passed. however, it later emerged that the ""board"" consisted of just four people - three who voted, plus a ""chairman"". and on the day, one of the voters was off sick. thus the remaining two voters and the chairman sat down to view ""la bete"".  one of said voters thought, like me, that the film was hilarious and hardly likely to encourage foul deeds by anyone. the other lacked imagination and simply thought the piece disgusting. and the chairman didn't understand it, so decided to err on the side of freedom.  when the missing voter finally saw the film, they too thought it disgusting, but it was too late! the film had received its ""x-london"" certificate and opened to mixed reaction. the g.l.c. film censorship board was disbanded soon after! thus ""la bete"" only opened in london by what could best be termed a fluke! but i'm glad it was. it's great! if you haven't seen it, do so. it's a fantasy, and as such, it's far less disturbing than most things you see on the news these days...",1
"""voodoo academy"" features an ""academy"" like no other, one that houses only six male students in one bedroom. these teenage guys are instructed in religion by a sinister young priest, who enjoys tormenting and comforting them simultaneously. the sole administrator of this ""academy"" is a young and seductive headmistress, and she retains her handsome charges on a short leash, so to speak.  sexual overtones abound, and the director obviously has high regard for young male bodies. these young actors occasionally strip down to their designer underwear to sneak about the ""academy,"" and their sexuality is the entire focus of the movie. if you're not interested in the male form -- stay away!  burdened by weak and awkward dialogue, this low-budget exploitation piece just stumbles along with a few laughable special effects tossed in between the yawns. the mood is claustrophobic, with tediously long takes, a handful of cheap sets and few costume changes. these visual elements come interspersed with seemingly unending sequences of banal dialogue, intended as character and plot development. it gives one the feeling it was filmed in three days...",0
"kids - of whatever age - do not want to know about their parents' sex lives. and grown-up children are often seriously baffled and disconcerted by any evidence that aging parents possess an active libido. lastly, many moviegoers are very uncomfortable watching a dowdy, frumpy widow who would pass unnoticed almost anywhere discover her aching capacity and need for raw passion with a handsome man half her age.  ""the mother"" is a provocative look at a scarcely filmed reality - a woman who isn't ready to stay home, watch ""the telly,"" and vegetate after her husband of nearly three decades, and a controlling, dominating chap at that, packs it in with a massive heart attack.  may (anne reid) and her husband have two children, each dysfunctional in his or her own way. the male son lives with a beautiful wife who may well be driving him to the bankruptcy court with her extravagant commercial venture. paula (cathryn bradshaw), is a teacher with aspirations of succeeding as a writer. she's attractive, not pretty, and she seems to have a close relationship with mum - at first.  back at her house after burying her husband, may determines to not stay there. rejecting typical widowhood with its legacy of boring days and no adventure, she goes to stay with paula who has a young son. paula's boyfriend, darren (daniel craig), is a ruggedly handsome contractor who seems to be taking an awfully long time to complete an addition to may's son's house. may is quite taken with hard-drinking, coke-sniffing darren whose treatment of paula ought to have alerted may that he was, for sure, a fellow of the royal academy of cads.  what follows is a torrid affair between darren and the besotted and now bubblingly alive (dare i say reborn?) widow. the love scenes are graphic but take second place to amateur artist may's pen and ink sketches of their trysts which then play a role in the enfolding drama (or debacle, take your pick).  the theater in manhattan was packed for today's early afternoon showing with well over half the audience in the range of may's age. that some were shocked or disturbed to see her disporting herself with erotic abandon in the arms of a much younger man is an understatement.   this blindingly honest look at an older woman's awakened passion after decades of dutifully obeying her husband's desire that she stay at home and raise kids (she also mentions he didn't like her to have friends-what a guy) surfaces a number of issues. while may's dalliance with darren doesn't constitute incest, there are real psychological dimensions, and issues, with a mother bedding her daughter's lover. and paula isn't made of the stoutest stuff to begin with. the affair, once disclosed, allows the peeling open of the mother-daughter relationship which, from paula's viewpoint, left something to be desired. ms. bradshaw is excellent in the role of a daughter who wants her mother's support as well as her love-she hasn't been dealt a terrible hand by life but it isn't a bed of roses either.  may is strong in her resolve to both acknowledge her sexuality and expect, indeed demand, a future of happiness. but she is also inescapably vulnerable. she's fishing in uncharted emotional waters. who controls her relationship with darren and why are difficult issues for her to understand, much less resolve. in her sixties, she's still a work in progress.  ""something's gotta give"" recently showcased mature sexuality but in an amusingly antiseptic way assuring no viewer would be discomfited. after all it's jack nicholson and the always beautiful diane keaton cavorting in the world of the rich. and to insure that no serious psycho-social issues were explored, keaton's young girlfriend, amanda peet, daughter of keaton, not only blesses the match but insures that the audience knows she and her old(er) would-be lover never hopped into the sack.  no easy out here. anne reid's inspired performance forces discomfort on some while drawing respect from others. her naked body bursts with sexuality for some and appears absurd as an object of physical attraction to others (the comments of audience members leaving today reflected all these views).  kudos to director roger michell for tackling a fascinating story with verve and empathy.  9/10.",1
"the league of gentlemen is one of the funniest, strangest, darkest and most unforgettable comedies of our time. so much so, it paved the way for more comedies of its ilk, many of which have copied the style, but have never succeeded.  unlike every other sketch show around, the characters of the league of gentlemen are all loosely connected. firstly they all live in the fictional town of royston vasey, in the back of beyond of northern england.   the first characters to greet newcomers are tubbs and edwrad, the pig-faced owners of a supposedly local shop situated so far away most of the residents probably don't know of its existence. other oddities include: the denton family, with an obsession with hygiene, chastity and toads; hillary briss who sells a special yet thankfully unknown brand of meat; pauline, a restart officer with a sharp tongue and even sharper pens; mr. chinnery, kind-hearted vet and menace to all things four-legged; geoff tipps, a plastics salesman with a vicious sense of humour, often involving guns, electric tubes and . . . . . . . plums!!!!!   despite being a comedy at heart, the league of gentlemen often transcends genres whilst never appearing to be spoofing or ripping off other people's material. there are several horror references such as the disappearance of a hiker, a pair of silent twins, an obsessive circus owner, and a sudden outbreak of nosebleeds. even more striking are moments when the series takes on a more sobre tone and aforementioned characters such as pauline and geoff are shown in a more sympathetic, vulnerable light. the film adaptation is the best demonstration of this, but some fans may decide they belong local.  the equally underrated third series also takes a different route, instead of sketches each episode focuses on an individual character with each storyline leading to one conclusion involving a plastic bag and a runaway theatre company van. although many fans may not enjoy the structure of the film or the third series as much as the first two, they're certainly signs to how inventive the league of gentlemen can be, and how unafraid to explore new areas.  in short, the league of gentlemen is definitely worth a look, as like the welcome signs says: you'll never leave!",1

"if they could get ed asner why didn't they get other actors instead of people who go to the same church as the producers? and why did the protagonist throw the wise old sage character to the ground when he was never in danger. it forced the old guy to mask the injury out of pride and so the young guy would feel guilty leaving him with a life long disability. i guess thats why the main character refuses money though and why the old guy works him like a dog even when he volunteers for extra work. if the d-bag boyfriend is a bad guy because he is long-distance boyfriend then why is a soldier any better. he has good reason to be jealous, good reason to get her away from her hometown and over protective, controlling manipulative father. all the characters that are meant to be likable aren't and everyone else is the 'bad' boyfriend. how did they meet anyway, a wine broker and a saw mill worker?",0

"******warning: may contain spoilers**************  so who are these ""mystery men?"" simply put, the mystery men are a group of sub-heroes desperately trying to live out their adolescent fantasy lives while botching both their real identities and their super identities. the shoveller (bill macy) works construction during the day, and at night, leaves his wife and kids at home while he cruises the street looking for crimes to tackle with his extraordinary and unique shovel-fighting style. the blue raja (hank azaria) sells silverware to newlyweds by day and flings tableware at crackpot villians by night, if his mom isn't keeping him busy with the latest snooping. mr. furious works in a junk yard to earn his pay, then takes out his frustration on his friends at night, tossing ill-conceived one-liners at friend and foe alike and threatening to get really angry (leaving everyone to wonder, so what?). ben stiller breathes such life into this character, you can't help but love him.  these three spend their nights trying to capture that 'moment of glory' they've dreamed about... becoming real super heroes. obviously, it could happen. champion city has captain amazing, after all... a flying, fighting super-cop with enough corporate logos on his costume to stop an extra bullet or two. greg kinnear turns in a stellar performance as a middle-aged sellout trying to recapture his fans attention in the twilight of his career.  to bring back that 'extra magic' that might win the endorsements again, c.a. frees casanova frankenstein, a waaaaay over-the-top menace played to chilling perfection by goeffrey rush. this lunatic genius has created a 'psychofrakulator' to warp champion city into a reflection of his own insanities... and ends up capturing c.a. within hours of his release from prison. this leaves only the mystery men to stop frankenstein's evil plan, but with such henchmen as the disco boys protecting frankenstein, the trio are going to need a little help.  recruiting commences, and after a painful recruitment party, the team settles in with the bowler (janeane garofolo), who initially has the only real talent in the team, with her mystic bowling ball seemingly animated by the vengeful spirit of her dead father; the invisible boy (kel mitchell), who claims to turn invisible when absolutely no one is looking at him; the spleen (paul reubens), granted mystically powerful flatulence by an angry gypsy; and the much underused sphinx (wes studi), who is shown to be able to cut guns in half with his mind, then spends much of the rest of the movie spouting inane riddles and acting over-wise.  this film really is a cross-genre romp. anyone wanting to pigeon-hole films into neat little categories is fighting a losing battle. this is a spoof/parody of the superhero genre - from the pseudo-burton sets recycled endlessly (and occasionally decorated with more spoof material) to the ridiculous costumes, the comic-book genre gets a pretty good send-up. but at the same time, it is a serious superhero flick, as well. both at once. while not a necessarily unique idea in itself (for example, this movie is in some ways reflective of d.c. comic's short-lived inferior five work), it is fairly innovative for the big screen. it offers the comic-book world that requires a suspension of disbelief to accept anyway, then throws in the inevitable wanna-bes - and we all know, if superheroes were real, so would these guys be real. if the big guy with the s were flying around new york city, you'd see a half-dozen news reports about idiots in underwear getting their butts kicked on a regular basis. sure, the shoveller fights pretty well, and the blue raja hurls forks with great accuracy - all parts of the super-hero world. but does that make them genuine super-heroes? only in their minds.  this movie is also a comedy, albeit a dark one. inevitable, when trying to point out the patent ridiculous nature of super-heroics. one-liners fly as the comic geniuses on stage throw out numerous bits to play off of. particularly marvelous is the dialogue by janeane garofalo with her bowling ball/father. yet, it isn't a comedy in the sense of side-splitting laughter or eternally memorable jokes. it mixes in a dose of drama, of discovery and of romance, but never really ventures fully into any of it.  what really makes mystery men a good film, in the end, is that it is very engaging. the weak/lame good guys are eventually justified and, for one shining moment, really become super-heroes; justice is served; and the movie ends with a scene that reeks of realism (as much realism as is possible in a world where bowling balls fly and glasses make the perfect disguise). if the viewer stops trying to label the film, then the film can be a great romp.  of course, no movie is perfect. claire forlani comes off as bored and directionless as mr. furious' love interest, in spite of having a pivotal role as his conscience. tom waits seems somehow confused by his own lines as the mad inventor dr. heller, although his opening scenes picking up retired ladies in the nursing home is worth watching alone. and the villians are never more than gun-toting lackeys (a point of which is made in the film). the cinematography is choppy and disjointed (such as happens in the average comic book, so it is excusable), the music sometimes overpowers the scenery, and the special effects are never quite integrated into the rest very well.  yet, overall, this film is incredible. you probably have to be a fan of comics and the superhero genre to really appreciate this movie, but it's a fun romp and a good way to kill a couple of hours and let your brain rest.  8/10 in my opinion.",1
"i first saw this film as a young boy and recently purchased it on dvd.  james stewart brings great depth to the role of chip hardesty, a hardworking and dedicated fbi agent. his life in the bureau is intercut with his family life, which is not all rosy. his wife (an excellent portrayal by vera miles) lives in fear of the dangerous nature of his job, and they even separate for a time; chip's best friend and fellow agent sam crandall (murray hamilton) is killed in a gunfight; chip's son, mike, enlists in the marines during world war ii. through it all, the family carries on with bravery and dignity.  the action sequences are quite exciting and the semi-documentary style of the film works effectively. and the music by max steiner says it all; fidelity, bravery and integrity.  this country owes a great debt of gratitude to the men and women of the fbi and, yes, to j. edgar hoover as well. if mr. hoover's type of vigilance had been observed, we might have been spared 9/11, the surge in crimes against children and many of the venal politicians we've had to put up with since his passing.",1

"i had a recent spectator experience with the perfect witness (2007) because the netflix computer recommendation engine suggested i watch this film. apparently, at some point, i told it how much i liked michael haneke's, benny's video. i don't know about you, but this parallel being drawn provoked in me a maelstrom of emotion and excitement over thomas c. dunn's film and made the allocation of my time toward it virtually impossible to refuse. just this kind of recommendation from the netflix computer intelligence, for me, had the aesthetic/moral movie bar set to level so high that, upon reflection, it represented something pretty much unaccomplished in every film produced in the year 2007.  having prefaced my response to the film that way, i'm going to proceed in knocking this picture down as poorly executed and banal; and i really hate to do that because i think our boy, wes bentley, happens to be not only one of the most interesting young faces in contemporary cinema, but also one its most overlooked and underrated screenacting talents in the us. i'm more than moderately concerned that the poor guy's going to miss the fame ship if he keeps fiddling around with first time movie directors like this.  the perfect witness is about micky (wes bentley), who, about thirty, still lives with mom (""you're not drinkin' again area ya's?""), but he's a ""filmmaker"" or at the very least some kind of street-level voyeur with a pension for shooting would-be johns in the seedy back alleys of philadelphia with his dvx 100b. out there, doing his private investigator-like drills, micky ""inadvertently"" video-tapes a brutal murder on a hapless early-twenty-ish coed with his hand held camcorder. baring the notion in mind that snuff and movies as cultural currency can be his equated with his ticket out of the white urban ghetto (and not to the debts of his unwitting friends and relatives who put up the money for his atrocious films), micky approaches the assailant, james lemac (mark borkowski: also takes a writing credit) or ""mac the knife"" whichever- and blackmails the killer into making a documentary about his murder impulses, holding this found footage over the attacker with threats of the police.  the problem with this movie is not that no interesting ideas exist because they do. while both the writing and direction are amateurish, that alone doesn't make a film bad. it's that these guys commit a rather poor assumption that what they are presenting is shocking in the context of a culture in which just about any person in the free world with access to a private computer can log-on to the web and catch the veracity of the action of a beheading on their little mac or pc. no film relies on shock value alone any more (unless of course, ironically, it's a film about torture on animals) and therefore cinematic images of violence (real or fake) have less and less cultural capital with each year that passes. also, we've got this astounding actor-talent in the lead all styled-up, real hip guy: his two inch beard and skull cap with the little bill on it, backwards, just like the dork from high school who craved after the potential services of my primary love interest same guy who just now calls himself a ""poet.""  spare me. ""i'm an artist,"" ""i'm a filmmaker."" okay. please do, carry on with that shtick, cronnie. seems to have bought you a lot of expensive 35mm stock. and go ahead, you can wear all the accrutements of a ""creative"" but don't expect us top respond to you, to follow your below average character through your two hour movie while you take down wes bentley's career. why don't we just let history speak to the merits of what you do, filmmaker guy. my guess is history will eventually have say something about that like, probably that's in not is good as you think it is. and yeah, odds are you'll be laying the blame on your dear ole ma, end up like our man micky here in the perfect witness; hooked on smack and covered in your buddy's blood with a video camera in your hand. great.",0
"one wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen, like it's the case with this movie. ""the wedding date"" is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake, under the guise of a new story, something that should have been let alone. if a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos' approval, then go all out with big stars and glossy production values, that way, people will come for the stars.  alas, that's not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy. the problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to london, when basically, this seems to be a typical american situation that not even the setting will be able to fix. then there is the problem with the stars. debra messing and dermot mulrooney? they have as much chemistry as oil and vinegar!  since the kat and nick have no conflict from the start, the viewer is not pulled into the film the way the creators thought they would be. it's clear that kat will fall for nick, and vice-versa in this predictable story. amy adams, who was the best asset in ""junebug"", comes across as a shallow girl who is willing to keep her lie going on and not come clean to the man that loves her and is going to marry her.  for anyone interested, the credits at the end of the film run for almost seven minutes!",0

"much like orson welles thirty years earlier,mike sarne was given ""the biggest train set in the world""to play with,but unfortunately lacked the ability to do anything more than watch his train set become a train wreck that is still spoken of with shock and a strange sort of awe. despite post - modern interpretations purporting somehow to see it as a gay or even feminist tract,the fact of the matter is that it was a major disaster in 1970 and remains one today.how anyone given the resources at mr sarne's disposal could have screwed up so royally remains a closely - guarded secret.only michael cimino ever came close with the political and artistic armageddon that constitutes ""heaven's gate"".both films appeared to be ego trips for their respective directors but at least mr cimino had made one of the great movies of the 1970s before squandering the studio's largesse,whereas mr sarne had only the rather fey ""joanna"" in his locker. furthermore,""heaven's gate"" could boast some memorable and well - handled set - pieces where,tragically,""myra breckinridge""s cupboard was bare. simply put,it is overwhelmingly the worst example of biting the hand that feeds in the history of hollywood.",0
"mary pickford often stated that tess skinner was her favorite movie role. well said! she played the part twice and for this version which she herself produced, she not only had to purchase the rights from adolph zukor but even give him credit on the film's main title card. needless to say her portrayal of this role here is most winning. indeed, in my opinion, the movie itself rates as one the all-time great experiences of silent cinema.  true, director john s. robertson doesn't move his camera an inch from start to finish, but in robertson's skillful hands this affectation not only doesn't matter but is probably more effective. a creative artist of the first rank, robertson is a master of pace, camera angles and montage. he has also drawn brilliantly natural performances from all his players. jean hersholt who enacts the heavy is so hideously repulsive, it's hard to believe this is the same man as kindly dr christian; while lloyd hughes renders one of the best acting jobs of his entire career. true, it's probably not the way mrs white intended, but it serves the plot admirably, as otherwise we would have difficulty explaining why the dope spent a fortune on defense but made not the slightest attempt to ascertain who actually fired the gun that killed his future brother-in-law! needless to say, this particular quality of the likable hero is downplayed by jack ging in the bowdlerized 1960 version which also totally deletes the author's trenchant attack on smug, middle-class christianity. notice how the well-washed priest here moves forward a pace or two in surprise at the interruption, but then makes no attempt whatever to assist our plucky little heroine in the performance of duties that he himself was supposedly ordained to administer. this is a very moving scene indeed because it is so realistically presented.  ""tess"" also provides an insight into the work of another fine actress, gloria hope, whose work was entirely confined to silent cinema. she married lloyd hughes in 1921 and retired in 1926 to devote her life completely to her husband and their two children. lloyd hughes died in 1958, but she lived until 1976, easily contactable in pasadena, but i bet no-one had the brains to interview her. another opportunity lost!   to me, forrest robinson only made a middling impression as skinner. i thought he was slightly miscast and a brief glance at his filmography proves this: he usually played priests or judges! but david torrence as usual was superb.  in all, an expensive production with beautiful photography and marvelous production values.",1

"i was p***ed when i couldn't see this one when it was screening at the philly film fest last year, so when i saw that it was going to be on cable tonight, i put it on remind as soon as i could. so was it worth the wait? well let's backtrack a tad as i have yet to give you the plot. sean crawley is a young man who doesn't know what his path in life is. enter duke (george wendt) who introduces him to his boss ray (danny baldwin). one night ray totally hammered asks sean to off the guy that they had sean following around. and it goes on from there. which leads me back to the question posed. was it worth the wait? yes and no, the buildup was pretty good and george wendt stole the movie for me. he just took the ball and ran with it. but it's nowhere near as violent as i was led to believe and somewhere along the movies running time the ball is not only dropped, but fumbled and taken in the other direction. i know where this point happened exactly, but can't say without spoiling the film. but needless to say it happened. the ending doesn't save the film either. poor stuart gordon nothing can be good like ""re-animator"" or ""castle freak"".  my grade: c  where i saw it: showtime extreme  eye candy: kari wuhrer shows her ta-tas in one fantasy and then in the next more ta-tas and it pans down and...oh my god my eyes my eyes!!!!!",0
"there is this private campground in plymouth, massachusetts, that's been around since 1959. my grandparents were among its founders, my parents had a site starting in 1965, and my two brothers have sites there now.  (this doesn't have anything directly to do with the movie; bear with me.)   i spent summers at blueberry hill from when i was five years old to when i was eighteen, and it is to people like me to whom this film speaks: the ones for whom a group camp in the woods was, as my fiancée tells of me, ""the good and happy place."" if you've never experienced the lifestyle, indian summer will probably be lost on you; don't bother. it's not quick-paced, it doesn't have rapid cuts, the plots aren't in the least bit convoluted, it has no explosions, such dramatic tension as exists is mild, there aren't any a-list actors, there are no rapid-fire quips just to show off how clever the scriptwriters are (other than, perhaps, kimberley williams' killer line about how her fiancé shouldn't ""overwind his toys."" that is not the least degree what this movie is about, any more than the godfather is a slasher flick just because it has a lot of on screen gore.  but indian summer is godfather's polar opposite. if you have experienced the lifestyle, see this movie. don't read any more, just do it.  for me, this is a 9/10 film.",1

"oh dear!what a disappointment. i've been watching old westerns on british tv for decades, and i wasn't aware of this one until its showing yesterday - most other scott westerns come around every few years or so and are usually worth watching again.  the rich colour and outdoor sets were good, but that's all i can say about this film. i have to agree with most of the other negative comments already made. several times i felt like turning it off, and finally i did, halfway through, something i hardly ever do.  scott seemed unusually oily in charming the girls, his two sidekicks were annoying and so was the mexican bandit lad. and i've a feeling the army uniforms were 20 years or so too modern, not that this has bothered makers of many other westerns.  perhaps it got better in the second half, but i couldn't be bothered to wait and see.",0
"prison is set in wyoming where work on a new prison has hit a problem so the state board decide to re-open an old state penitentiary that has been closed for 20 years, warden eaton sharpe (lane smith) is put in charge. 200 odd prisoners are shipped in & they are put to work fixing the rundown prison up including burke (viggo mortensen) who is ordered to break into the old execution chamber, he duly obliges but when he penetrates the bricked up door an intense beam of light shoots out & all the electrics, gas & fire around the prison goes crazy for a few minutes. burke has unwittingly unleashed a deadly evil force which is in the mood for some killing & no-one is safe...  directed by renny harlin i thought prison was a poor late 80's horror flick that seemed to forget about the small point of having a story. the script was by empire pictures regular c. courtney joyner who was responsible for writing such 'classics' as class of 1999 (1990), puppet master iii: toulon's revenge (1991) & puppet master vs. demonic toys (2004) amongst other low budget horror crap that even i haven't heard of & seems to take itself very seriously. the biggest problems i have with prison are that it's far too slow, it's over 30 minutes into the film before the 'evil force' is even released although the pace does pick up towards the end but by then it was too little too late as far as i was concerned, then there's the fact there's no discernible storyline here at all. for a start it never tries to explain why there's an 'evil force' bricked up in the old execution chamber, it never explains why this force decides to kill random inmates when it's supposed to be out on a revenge mission or why it just doesn't kill warden sharpe straight away, no explanation is given to where burke fits into it even though he looks exactly the same as the prisoner who was electrocuted & has come back, there's no real explanation as to how the warden is connected to everything that's going on apart from two early nightmare sequences in which he seems to be remembering something although it's never revealed what it is or why. to be honest i couldn't really give you a plot synopsis as the film doesn't have a rigid story which it follows all the way through. the character's are dull & forgettable, the murders are few & far between, the pacing is way off, the whole film is a mess & even ghosts can't shoot straight when it comes to trying to shoot the hero. a less than satisfactory way to spend 100 odd minutes, there really are better things you could be doing.  director harlin's full american flick debut he does a good job & there's a decent atmosphere but after over an hour of constant drab, dull, dark prison cells & corridors i started to get bored. i just think the look of the film is far too repetitive, bland & frankly lifeless. i didn't think it was scary & the gore is pretty tame apart from the best moment in the entire film when a police guard gets killed when a load of barb wire wraps itself around his body & face with a nice close up of his throat being torn open. other than that there's a burnt corpse & a mangled body which falls from the ceiling & very little else. there is a scene when the warden burns all the prisoner mattresses in front of them & then makes them stand all night in their underwear in the yard, i was watching this scene & thought that you'd never get away with doing something like that. over here prisoners have rights & if the warden did something like that there would be a national outcry from all those humanitarians & every prisoner would sue the warden, the prison service & the government for everything they had & they'd win!  with a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 prison actually had a pretty healthy budget although it doesn't really look like it on screen, sure there's a decent cast & the few special effects that are included are good but overall it's set in the same location with limited ambition. prison was actually shot in a real wyoming state prison so it certainly looks the business. the acting is alright, prison proves that sometimes hollywood stars not only have one crap horror film skeleton in their closets but in the case of mortensen he has two with this & the awful the return of the texas chainsaw massacre (1994) both of which i'm sure he'd like to forget about...  prison is a dull, lifeless, colourless & humourless waste of 100 minutes, despite one good gore scene i didn't like it at all as i actually prefer my films to have a story rather than seemingly random events & incidents cobbled together with no narrative sense.",0
"scott is right. the best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie. the sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good. however, the fight in the middle is the best even compared to japanese samurai movies. chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the japanese in terms of entertainment value. especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies, japanese movies excel, example being the lone wolf and cub series. even though duels in japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most, the sheer intensity of those moments made them better. but, this is one example where chinese swordplay surpasses the japanese. the scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever. the other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene. if you haven't seen it, you have to. john woo is the man.",1
"this movie is not just bad, not just corny, it is repulsive. something about daphne, about the creepy call-girl, about the whole damn (and i use the word literally) film radiates a grotesquery that would offend a brothel mistress. this film makes my skin crawl, makes me regret having reproductive organs, and makes me feel unclean.  one of the things that bothers me most about this movie is that they used such a good concept. a creature that makes fantasies with disastrous results, rather than the cliché worst nightmare and the overdone twisted wish, is a truly fascinating film idea.  thought: the reason why hobgoblins need to be killed before day is that they are attracted to bright lights. during the day, bright lights don't show up well, so they could go anywhere.  count the hobgoblins: four hobgoblins drive out of the film studio, and yet at least nine of the pernicious plush-toys are killed throughout the course of the movie.  discussion question: if you had a frigid, demanding, unappreciative girlfriend, would you enter garden-tool-combat with a military chunkhead? explain.",0
"tales from the crypt: and all through the house starts on christmas eve as elizabeth (mary ellen trainor) kills her husband joseph (marshall bell), she drags his body outside ready to throw it down a well but while doing so misses an important news bulletin on the radio that says a homicidal maniac (larry drake) dressed as santa clause has escaped from a local mental asylum & has already killed several women with elizabeth next on his list but she has other ideas & tries to turn the seemingly dangerous situation to her advantage...  this tales from the crypt story was episode 2 from season 1, directed by the one of the show's regular executive producers robert zemeckis and all through the house is a decent enough watch. the script by fred dekker was actually based on a story appearing in the comic 'the vault of horror' & was originally adapted to film as one episode from the britsih horror anthology film tales from the crypt (1972) which starred joan collins as the murderous wife character here played by ellen trainor. this particular version is good enough but doesn't do anything different or special & is a bit too linear & predictable to be considered a classic. at only 25 minutes in length it certainly moves along at a good pace, the story is just about macabre enough & it generally provides decent entertainment & i quite liked the downbeat ending. this time there are christmas themed opening & closing crypt keeper (john kassir) segments complete with the usual puns.  director zemeckis does a good job & there's a nice winterly atmosphere with a hint of christmas influence as well. there's not much gore here, someone has a poker stuck in their head, someone's face is cut with an icicle, someone's arm is cut with an axe & there's some blood splatter but generally speaking it's not that graphic. the acting by a small cast is pretty good.  and all through the house isn't the best tale from the crypt but it's a decent one all the same, worth a watch but after the comic book story & original 1972 film version did we really need or even want this?",1

"man on fire tells a story of an ex-special forces guy with a drinking problem who accepts a job as a personal bodyguard of a little girl in mexico during the wave of kidnappings for ransom. at first he's not to friendly, but then they befriend with each other, he decides to stop drinking etc., etc... then one day she gets kidnapped... and killed...  and he, won't stop at anything to get the revenge.  that's basically the story of man on fire but expect some big twists at least a few times including the ending which is beautiful and will probably make you cry.  that's also because of the great music harry-gregson williams with lisa gerrard (gladiator) composed.  but the strongest part of the movie... wait... the thing is, everything here is perfect.  first - acting. denzel washington is at his best, mickey rourke and christopher walken good as always, great radtha mitchell and amazing young dakota fanning. and that's not the end of the list...  then come the cinematography which is dazzling and along with superb editing, should have won an oscar for sure.  the story is... not just a revenge movie. the story is intelligent, the story makes you think... and is pure beautiful. really.  this is one of those movies you need to see in your lifetime, at least once!",1
"i'm rather surprised that no reviewer so far has commented on the rather elementary chess blunder in luzhin's game as white against an unnamed opponent immediately before the final. despite the use of jonathan speelman as consultant chess expert, luzhin is shown winning the game with an illegal move. in between the rapid cuts away and back to the board it is not hard to spot that after luzhin's combination culminating in a queen sacrifice, his rook on d1 is still pinned by black's rook at c1 against his king in the corner at h1. thus he is unable to play the purported mating move rd1-d8 which would be illegal - but he's shown doing so to rapturous applause from the audience.",1
a great british indy movie! fantastic chemistry between the 3 main characters make for some hilarious drug-fuelled set pieces that cheech and chong would be proud of. great to see phil daniels back on the big screen (even if he has swapped sides since quadrophenia!) and gary stretch is surprisingly good and a treat for the ladies! loved the final fight scene with it's nod to zulu and now i know what happened to arthur brown after he set himself on fire on top of the pops!...he's not acting....he really is a bona-fide british hippie!!! you don't have to be a biker to enjoy this and it's straight into my friday night post-pub repeat viewing collection.   give this film a go and you won't be disappointed.,1
"we saw the silent version of this film, and it is quite simply shimmeringly beautiful. it's quite hard to see how a sound version could have been created, since it is shot with pure silent technique, long wordless sweeps of narrative without a single intertitle -- save for a few disconcerting sequences where louise brooks, playing a french typist, is quite visibly speaking in english... the only section that obviously cries out for sound is the final scene, where brooks is watching the rushes for her test 'for a sound film': footage which plays constantly in the background as the action unfolds, with her mouth moving in ceaseless soundless song. i was unsurprised to learn afterwards that this passage alone in the talkie version had been hailed as an exemplar of new technique!   in the sunny beauty of its opening scenes and the fairy-tale inevitability of what follows, the film resembles a dream. as a 'louise brooks movie' it was not at all what i was expecting, either from her hollywood comedies or from g.w.pabst's german melodramas: i found the idiom more fluent and enjoyable than either, and brooks herself is a different creature, a sturdy laughing young animal rather than a shop-window vamp or manipulated doll.  but what gives this film greater depth than at first appears is the unexpected second half; repelled by the rich parasites who cluster around her beauty, the pauper princess returns to a tear-stained reunion with her humbly-born true love... and the tale might very well have been ended there. fairy-tale, however, turns to tragedy. the dilettante grabovsky, confident in his ability to manipulate the woman he desires, is yet all too correct in his self-interested prediction -- the young lovers cannot make each other happy -- and andré, ironically, was right to mistrust the social influence of beauty contests: after the intoxication of her moment's glory, lucienne frets herself to despair over the humdrum routine of married life while her husband, in turn, is driven wild by any reminder of the whole affair. if it were a simple case of a mis-matched marriage, that would be one thing... but the true tragedy is that they do love each other.  in many ways ""prix de beauté"" reminds me of murnau's ""sunrise"". but if so, the fairground and photographer scenes here would form a distorted mirror-image of the joyous reconciliation in ""sunrise""; no dream but an alienating nightmare. and the following dawn brings not a miraculous reunion but an empty bed and deserted home. leaving a letter to say that she loves him and will always love him, lucienne vanishes again from andré's life in quest of brightness and freedom; and this time she will never come back.  gossip columns confirm all andré's worst convictions, as he learns of his wife's whereabouts through reports coupling her name with grabovsky. when the young workman penetrates at last to the lavish sanctum of the screening-room, it is with drawn gun -- to be greeted by the sight of his rival courting and caressing a laughing lucienne, the same woman who had pledged her undying affection as she left him. he kills her, but even as he kills is transfixed by the living image on screen, lucienne in all her transformed glory as he never saw her. the two women are juxtaposed in an endless, powerful moment, as andré is seen, seized, unresisting, and pulled away: the dying girl and her singing self still projected above, caught unknowing out of time into celluloid eternity, playing on unconscious of life or death or love beneath her...  the main jarring element in the film is the character of andré's co-worker antonin, who appears to serve no role throughout other than to be the licensed butt of his contemporaries' malice. he is the ugly one who can never get the girl, the ungainly wimp who is tripped and tormented in the washrooms and at work, and must take it all with an uncertain ingratiating smile in his fruitless hope for social acceptance: a typical product of the bullying of the more gifted and popular, in other words, but one the audience is apparently being invited to laugh at along with his tormentors. unless the intention is to expose a darker side to the protagonists (for which i perceive no sign), the character seems to exist merely as comic relief, but comic relief with a distinctly nasty edge. when we know him only as an inept peeping tom at the waterside, it's easy to laugh, although the others' revenge seems a little over the top; when we discover that he is no chance-met stranger but andré's colleague and regular sidekick, the continuing attacks rapidly cease to be very funny.  but it is the images that remain. beauty, nightmare, and dream.",1
"i missed the entire season of the show and started watching it on abc website during the summer of 2007. i am absolutely crazy about the show. i think the entire cast is excellent. it's one of my favorite show ever. i just checked the abc program lineup for this fall and did not see it on the schedule. that is really sad. i hope they will bring it back ... maybe they are waiting until bridget moynahan has her baby? or is it only my wishful thinking?   i read some of the comments posted about the show and see so many glowing remarks, similar to mine. i certainly hope that abc will reconsider its decision or hopefully another station will pick it up.",1
"with stunning cinematography and a thread of kafkaesque absurdity, this movie had me from the simple yet fascinating opening scene. the movie plays much like a dream, and i think that may be why people either hate it or love it. characters are drawn superficially and the story itself is slight and perhaps a little pointless. but these are failings of the movie but conscious choices. the film works isn't trying to work as history, but rather is a deconstruction of 1940s war movies.   i would have trouble arguing that there was much real substance to the movie, but the movie is such a cinematic wonder that i was completely swept away. this is one of the most beautifully filmed movies ever, and there is a wild imagination in its style. i can completely understand why people would hate it, but i give it 9/10.",1
"the secret fury, in many ways a run-of-the-mill romantic suspense drama (directed by mel ferrer) boasts top-notch principals in colbert and ryan; it stays puzzling if not quite gripping until towards the end, when implausibility conquers suspension of disbelief -- as so often it does in this genre. but for some viewers the film's highlight will be the portrayal of blowsy leah by vivian vance -- the immortal ethel mertz on ""i love lucy."" oddly, vance had very few film roles; her true home was broadway, where (among other gigs) she understudied for ethel merman. here she contributes a winning turn as a chambermaid suborned to play a minor part in a nefarious scheme; watch her half-heartedly trying to wave away the smoke when she's puffing a furtive cigarette in the hotel's linen-storage room -- a transgression for which she ultimately pays the supreme penalty.",1
"i remember this film from many years ago. certainly the best film on the subject in my experience. the fact that i vividly remember so much of the film after so long a time testifies to its impact.   it is difficult to comment on the level of the performances because of the language barrier. but they were nonetheless very powerful.  this subject continues to fascinate us even with the passing of years. and it was most effectively treated here, with the proper proportion of historical perspective and skepticism.  i wish it would be shown on tv at least once. or at least be available on tape or dvd. or is it? is some art film archive hoarding a copy of it??",1
"what we have here is a film about how the pursuit of money & revenge can corrupt your soul... or something like that. guy ritchie, a director known for his reworking of the gangster genre, bites off more than he can chew with this one.  his use of modern film noir to tackle the theme of a man setting himself free by swallowing his pride, being nice to his enemy & giving away all his money falls flat on it's face. when jason statham's character no longer fears ray liotta, it apparently drives liotta crazy enough to blow his head off in the final scene. why? basically you cannot set up a mafiosi like the liotta character, who has presumably got to his station in life by displaying the kind of ruthless behaviour evident throughout the film, only then to have him driven to suicide by nothing more than a pitying smile on the face of statham's character.  before anyone starts to say i'm missing the point... i'm not. i get it ok? opt out of the quest for riches & you'll find true happiness and inner peace. be nice to your enemy and this will confuse him into self-destruction. this seems to be the gist of the movie and in itself this is not a bad premise for a story, although hardly original. the problem is that ritchie simply doesn't have the skill as a movie maker to carry it off. at the moment when even guy ritchie realises this, he appears to get bored with the story and begins to insert red-herrings: the scene when statham gets knocked over by a car - why? the shooting of some scenes as marvel comic animations... again, why?  there are so many loose threads & unanswered questions left at the end of the movie you could get all 2001-ish about it and try figuring them out, or simply accept that there are no answers & each viewer will interpret things in their own way. myself? i was so bored with the pompous tone of the film that i simply didn't care. frankly the ending couldn't come too soon so that i didn't have to sit through any more of this pretentious psychobabble.  a waste of two hours of my life.",0
"jane eyre has always been my favorite novel! when i stumbled upon this movie version in the late 90's i was ecstatic! this is the best and most complete version of the book on film! this version is a little long to sit through in one sitting but well worth it. timothy dalton is amazing as rochester. i was glad that they cast a normal looking actress (zelah clark) as jane and not a glamorous person. i love the sets and the location. for anyone who is a true jane eyre fan, this is the version to watch!!! for those of you who are interested, i just found this version on dvd. i have watched my vhs copy almost to breaking so i was thrilled to find it on dvd.",1
"i do get irritated with modern adaptations of shakespeare when the director can't make his mind up whether to use the original or to update it. if it's using the original words in an updated setting, that's particularly tricky if set in the 20th or 21st century although it can work ok in period styles, eg the trevor nunn twelfth night set late victorian very effectively. it could work with the 30's setting if only there had been far less of the song and dance and far more of shakespeare's text. unfortunately, it just ends up being a pretty trivial though very pleasant show.   another problem is branagh himself. i agree he's far too old to play one of the students but more important, he's such an experienced shakespearean actor that in spite of all his efforts to be just another student, his strength of acting shows all the time. of course he should have played the king - no problem in having a mature student king surrounded by younger students. instead we had a pleasant but unimposing actor for the king, thus an unimposing so-called king with no kingly attributes.   the amount of song and dance, which i found tedious in spite of the nice songs and pleasant enough dancing, unfortunately meant the great shakespearean dialogue had to be cut down drastically. so the whole thing ends up a trivial and mild confection, and i got very bored, including with the comic turns, and was glad when it ended. branagh has not done shakespeare justice in this production.  accolades however to richard briers and geraldine mcewan, absolutely splendid as the older couple.",0
"""citizen x"" tells the story of ""the butcher of rostov"", nickname for a heinous and perverse russian serial killer who claimed 52 lives from 1978-92. the film focuses on the novice detective (rea) who doggedly pursued the killer against all odds in the face of an uncooperative bureaucracy in self-serving and convenient denial. an hbo product for t.v., the film offers a solid cast, good performances, spares the audience much of the grisly details, but plays out like a docudrama sans the stylistics of similar hollywood fare. an even and straight-forward dramatization of a serious and comparatively little known story more interesting than ""jack the ripper"".

"after viewing several episodes of this series, i have come to the conclusion that television producers are completely devoid of any form of originality. here is an old science fiction standby, ingeniously wrapped in the form of a truly original concept - and still they can only -almost - make it work.  the dialog is good! the male actors are reasonably proficient at their professions. most of the characters are well drawn, with special kudos to the hero and his more than likeable side-kick. and most of the episode plots come across as palatable. so what could be wrong? how about the, the female characters and the cosmeticly perfect actresses who are chosen to portray them.   the producers insist on portraying the female characters in this - almost good - series, in a manner that makes the end product appear to be a misplaced cheerleader. why, i ask, why?  the episodes all fall flat whenever the female guest star or recurring character comes on screen. these actresses are all totally unbelievable in their roles, and you don't actually have to see them to know they are incapable of their acting assignments. a blind person could tell. just listen to them talk. they deliver their dialog with all the drama and effect of a 16 year old at the high school prom. who would believe these women are phd scientist, senators, corporate executives and medical doctors?  in a nut shell, if the producers have their choice of a stockard channing or a morgan fairchild, guess who they'll choose - every time? and of course, the series suffers for it. too bad!",1
"whoever wrote the script for this movie does not deserve to work in hollywood at all (not even live there), and those actors need to find another job. the most dreadful hour and some minutes of my life... and i only kept watching to see if it would get better which, unfortunately for me it did not.  even at the end, the credits gave me anxiety. i guess there weren't a lot of people behind the movie so they had to roll the credits slowly... very slowly.  this movie is definitely a great ""how not to make a movie"" guide. too bad i can't give a 0.",0
ya. that is what i think. sure it was still a great show with john in it but i personally think that it is way better without.  i love having c.j. and grandpa living at the house because they are so funny together.  when john was still around i really didn't laugh as much as i do now.  it is too bad that no more are being made. ( i don't think...) because i would love to see some new material.  my favorite character must be rory. poor rory is almost always left out. it is always about bridget or carrie. what about rory!!!??? honestly this is a great show and to any one who has never watched it you must go and watch it. i almost guarantee you will laugh. well even chuckle.,1
"as far as the muppet line goes, however, this is not the best, nor the second best. this was marketed towards the kiddies, but has some dark, and emotionally upsetting adult moments, to which parents may not wish to expose their children. one of which showcases miss piggy going ""postal"" in a jealous rage, which lasts basically throughout the duration of this work.  beyond that, however, the story is progressive, and highly entertaining. one scene in which joan rivers and miss piggy go berserk in a department store is simply hilarious! and there are other parts of this work which contain the same level of levity and fun.  i like this very much, and enjoy it still today.  it rates a 7.6/10 from...  the fiend :.",1
"this film is great. as often heard, it is indeed very realistic and sometimes brutal, but unlike some other people i am clearly not of the opinion that it is depressing, negativistic or dismantling austria as a proto-fascist society. quite the contrary: while there are indeed some very heavy scenes in hundstage and some characters are to be called very bad persons, at the same time you watch love, beauty and humor in ulrich seidls film. and that's exactly what distinguishes hundstage for me from other films that try to show the lives of the 'ordinary people' in an intense, realistic way; their hustle, their wishes, their dark sides: seidl clearly never tries to prove, that the lives of the working-class people are trash! in my opinion, viewers who come to this conclusion seem to be very afraid of admitting, that nearly nobody's live is as 'clean' and 'normal' as we would like other people to believe. and that every live has its dark and often depressing sides. the most beautiful scene: the old viennese man, watching his old girl dancing 'the oriental way', as he is calling it. i think everybody who finds this scene ugly lacks a sense of beauty and should ask themselves what it is, that's proto-fascist: the characters in hundstage or viewers, who are turned off by the body of a 70+ year old woman, dancing with all her charms for her lover.",1
"spoilers alert  homeward bound: the incredible journey is an important film from my life because it's the first film i remember seeing in the cinema of my home town as a 4-year old scamp. the story is based on the sheila burnford novel, and is a reason why it's not possible to write this one off as a brainless lassie clone.  the basic story: two dogs and a cat happily live in the seaver family when the new husband to the mother of the three children, gets a job in the city and they have to temporarily move into inner san francisco while the animals are sent to a ranch to live for a couple of months. the bonds between the animals and the children they watch out for are especially strong, and shadow the golden retriever and sassy the himalayan cat are heartbroken as the children are, though the young and happy-go-lucky american bulldog known as chance is a little less concerned and somewhat cynical (due in part to his voice-over explaining his being abandoned as a pup, picked up to an animal shelter, and being bought by the family), though his growth as a character during the story provides much of the important storytelling.  the three pets escape the ranch and head off into the wide and dangerous wilderness (fantastic wilderness settings by the way), driven on by shadow's instincts of direction. they meet several perils along the way, hoping to make it home, while the family and the ranch hosts are suddenly concerned about the animal disappearance. there are funny moments all the way through, great dialogue between the three animals and hilarious lines (see - memorable quotes), and a touching comradeship that grows between the main characters during the course of the storytelling, punctuated by moments of sadness (such as when sassy's arrogance of trying to cross a river without getting wet causes her to fall in the river and get washed down a waterfall, leaves a moment of loss that is felt deeply by the viewers).  somehow though, i fail to see what the inclusion of saving the girl lost in the wilderness adds to the story and the journey they take. somehow, it seems a little unnecessary as part of the story.  the ending cranks the stakes higher when shadow falls into a pit in a trainyard and having hurt his leg, finds it hard to get out and gives up, exhausted, followed by chance climbing in with him to persuade him to climb out, telling him how important he is to him and how he's pushed them this far so he shouldn't throw it all away so easily.   the way that this scene (brilliantly done) isn't concluded leaves an ambiguity that carries on into the final scene when chance and sassy return home, but shadow is nowhere to be seen. then just as all seems lost, he slowly appears, and is reunited with the family. chance's conclusion at the end speaks of the comradeship that has developed between he and his fellows on the journey, and the realisation to what home really is from his long journey to get there, leaves a fine epilogue to demonstrate how much his character has grown, but also how the other two have as well. hang on a second, i think i'm going to cry...  anyway, i haven't read sheila burnford's book, so i don't pretend to know where the differences between book and film lie. but this is a film that all the family can watch, and while the tots will love the talking animals, older viewers will understand the plot line better (as i found when i watched the film again after several years without seeing it). this film is a masterpiece in cinema, and i suggest that if you haven't seen it you go out and get it!  and please avoid the sequel (see my review for homeward bound ii!)",1
"as a spiritualist and non christian. i thought i really was going to be holding onto my faith, but what a load of i seers. i thought the film would have great arguments, but only got one sided views from atheists and jews??? and who are all these street people he's interviewing who don't know the back of their arm from their head. where are the proper theologians and priests and stuff he could have got arguments from. not retired nuts who wrote books and finished their studies in 1970. personally this dvd was a waste of time and not worth my time to check if the facts are right or wrong or if i should or should not believe because an anti-christ told me so. please to think he came up with the conclusion of not finding god because his own ego and demons got the better of him. no im not going to say the movie was stunning to help atheists reading this feel better about themselves. but if you really want to show the world you care about us poor souls who believe in jesus then entice us with your worth, not your beating off the drums.",0
"first, let me just comment on what i liked about the movie. the special effects were fantastic, and very rarely did i feel like i was watching a video game. there, that is the last nice thing i have to say about this film. in fact, i would just like everyone reading this to take note that i can't even put into words how hard it was for me to write this review without swearing.   i have innumerable complaints about the film, but four major complaints jump to mind. my first major complaint has to do with the incredible cheesiness of the ""plot twist"" (if you can call it that since most people probably saw it coming a mile away) where lois's 5 year-old son turns out to be the super-powered child of superman. when the crying super-child throws a piano at lex's henchman to save his mother, i almost got up and left the theater. singer could have made a much better superman movie without resorting to cheap gimmicks like a seemingly fragile but latently super-powered illegitimate child. it's been 5 days since i saw the movie and i still want to vomit.   my next major complaint has to do with the fact that superman lifts a continent made out of kryptonite up into outer space. it doesn't take comic book guy from the simpsons to point out what's wrong with that. i don't know how many comic books brian singer has read, but when superman is exposed to even a small amount of kryptonite he barely has the strength to stay on his feet. whoever had the idea to have him fly a large island made out of his greatest weakness into space has no business being associated with any superman-related projects ever again. the concept is as ridiculous as making a dracula movie where the title character has a stake through his heart and still manages to fly a spaceship made out of garlic into the sun. why not just have superman eat kryptonite? he can eat it and then brush his teeth with it, and then go to sleep in kryptonite pajamas. that's not any more absurd then having him hoist a continent of kryptonite into space and then fall powerless through the atmosphere without burning up in re-entry or splattering all over central park when he hits the ground.   my third major complaint has to do with the fact that singer slaps movie-goers across the face with religious symbolism the entire movie. i have to take issue with his characterization of superman as the only son of a god-like jor-el sent to earth to be a savior. jor-el wasn't all-wise, he was just a scientist. and he didn't send his son to earth to be a savior, he threw him in a rocket and hurriedly fired it into space because his planet was about to explode. i'll buy the christ allegory if brian singer can show me the part in the bible where god sends christ to earth because heaven was about to explode, and then radioactive pieces of heaven become christ's primary weakness. furthermore, the ""crucifixion"" scene where luthor stabs superman in the side with a kryptonite ""spear"" just makes me want to slam my face into a brick until i'm too brain-dead to notice the brazenly obvious and inappropriate symbolism that will be tainting the man of steel for the foreseeable future. they might as well rename this movie ""superman returns: the passion of the christ.""  and speaking of luthor, my last major complaint has to do with singer's depiction of lex luthor. lex luthor is a shrewd, cold-hearted business tycoon who is more apt to run for president (which he does in the comics) than try to destroy the world. the man wants money and power; he wants to be in charge, not wreck everything. yet the luthor we see superman returns, as well as all the previous superman movies, is a wacky theatrical dunce who comes up with zany schemes to destroy the world. if singer had the slightest loyalty to the characters instead of the (quite awful) previous superman movies, this film might not be such an unbearable travesty. maybe singer's next project can be a batman movie where he focuses on the interpretation of batman from 1960s tv show. zam! whap! pow!!  to summarize, i don't know what i hate more, the movie itself or the fact that so many people seem to be giving it good reviews. everyone is entitled to their opinion, but if you don't hate this movie then your opinion is wrong. i sincerely encourage anyone who reads this not to see this movie if you haven't already. don't see it, don't buy it when it comes out on dvd, don't rent it...basically don't contribute any money towards it in any way. this movie does not deserve to make any money. in fact, i think that for every person that sees this movie, bryan singer should be fined 45 billion dollars. if you're a superman fan and you really want to see this movie, just bend over and have someone kick you in the balls and you'll get the same experience without having to waste 2 hours of your time.",0
this has to be the worst movie i have seen. madsen fans don't be drawn into this like i was. he is only in it for a maximum of five minutes. this movie is so bad that the only reason why you would watch it is if all the rest of the movies on earth as well as t.v. had been destroyed.,0
"at this point it seems almost unnecessary to state that jon bon jovi delivers a firm, strong, seamless performance as derek bliss. his capability as an actor has been previously established by his critical acclaim garnered in other films (the leading man, no looking back). but, in case anyone is still wondering, yes, jon bon jovi can act. he can act well and that's come to be expected of him. it's easy to separate derek from the guy who belts out hits on vh-1.  i generally would not watch a horror movie. i've come to expect them to focus on sensationalistic gore rather than dialogue and plot. what pleased me most about this film was that there really was a viable plot being moved along. the gore is not so much as to become the focus of the film and does not have a disturbingly realistic quality of films with higher technical effects budgets. so, gore fans might be disappointed, but story fans will not.  unlike an action film like u-571 where the dialogue takes a back seat to the bombast, we get a chance to know ""the good guys"" and actually care what happens to them. a few scenes are left unexplained (like derek's hallucinations) but you get the feeling certain aspects were as they were to lay the foundation for a sequel. unfortunately, with the lack of interest shown by hollywood in this film, that sequel will never happen. these few instances are forgiveable knowing that vampires could have been a continuing series.  is this the best film i've ever seen in my life? no. is it a good way to spend about two hours being entertained? yes. it won't leave the person who fears horror movies with insomnia and it won't leave the horror movie lover completely disappointed either. if you're somewhere in between the horror genre loather and the horror genre lover, this film is for you. it reaches a happy medium with the effects and story balancing each other.

"set in providence, rhode island, feeding the masses tries to be a satiric look at the role of the media in government. at best, it could be applied to how the us try to control media during the iraq war, but it ends up feeling hollow. there's never any really tension in the story and the acting never very good. worst, the direction of the movie is atrocious, focus more on odd camera angles that fail to convey anything beyond ""isn't this an odd way to hold the camera."" special effects are pretty bad...at one point video of an explosion is green screened over the city, and it's laughable at best.  the film does have a couple bright spots...namely the advertisements for post-zombie services (including a reclamation service and a party bus). but it's far too little to make the film worthwhile.  for a better zombie film, try hide and creep. it has the same weak production value, but there's much more wit, humor and talent behind it.",0
"val kilmer and dylan mcdermott are terrific. i have seen kilmer on the doors, however his interpretation of john holmes is superb. nothing compared to boogie nights which was kind of slow. wonderland is a movie which is able to show you a horrible crime story from the perspective from a guy who is just indulged in his drug vice and indolent of what ever happens around. at the same time, the john holmes character shows a very clever hustler who is able to pass through the nastiest and ugliest situations almost unharmed. the movie deserves being watched more than once. the seventies ambiance sensual and full of drugs is amazing.",1
"when this play was first shown by the bbc over 30 years ago, it would have been something quite different for the time. so therefor some people would have found it quite scary, and may well have been impressed with the special effects?  looking at the play in this day and age, it doesn't seem to be all that scary anymore, even the special effects can leave a lot to be desired.  would a train really be allowed to pass a red light into a dark tunnel? i don't think so......but if you watch this play again, you will observe that the first train that enters the tunnel, rushes straight through the red light! (maybe that's how it was in dickens time)?  you will also notice that the footpath that leads down to the signal box is very steep and in a poor state. surely there would have been a series of proper steps with handrails for the signalman to climb up or down into the cutting. (i can't help but notice things like that)  i will not take anything away from the acting, both denholm elliott (signalman) and bernard lloyd (the traveller) gave wonderful performances.  i am not at all sure what is going on......i mean was the ghost the traveller, or what??? does anyone really fully understand this rather confusing story??? (well maybe i am the only one that don't)???  to sum up.....  the play has a wonderful atmosphere throughout, with great character. it suffers from not being that scary these days, and a little if not very confusing in places, and has some rather unusual signalling practises....  thanks for reading my review.",0
"there have been very few films i have not been able to sit through. i made it through battle field earth no problem. but this, this is one of the single worst films ever to be made. i understand whoopi goldberg tried to get of acting in it. i do not blame her. i would feel ashamed to have this on a resume. i belive it is a rare occasion when almost every gag in a film falls flat on it's face. well it happens here. not to mention the sfx, look for the dino with the control cables hanging out of it rear end!!!!!! halfway through the film i was still looking for a plot. i never found one. save yourself the trouble of renting this and save 90 minutes of your life.",0
"ok, let me again admit that i haven't seen any other merchant ivory (the distributor) films. nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director, so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated. with that admittance, let me begin.  before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn't know which genre it wants to be. at first, it pretends to be a romance. in most romances, the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character, is separated from the supporting character, and is (sometimes) united with his or her partner. this movie's hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her. his name is henry moores and her name is sajani, and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj (british imperial rule). henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid, despite his legal marriage and child overseas. what could be better than that? they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them. word spreads to sajani's husband who questions her involvement with moores. she denies any contact with him, but moores asks her to leave the area. sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide. please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film. the film changes tone and becomes a crime-drama in its final portions.  sajani's body is discovered right as moores' family comes to visit. the alleged perpetrator is moores's english-educated assistant t.k. t.k. knows of his master's affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened. once he is declared innocent, he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores. t.k. is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall.  i want to warn you, this isn't a romance film. the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting. this image is captured directly from the film's opening, but quickly disappears. then it's over. it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love. it isn't effective, at all. not only is the movie not a romance, but its characters lack any personality. they are bundles of walking clichés. moores is an arrogant white man who doesn't recognize his indian friend, t.k.'s intelligence. t.k. is torn between his own heritage and his educative background. sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life. oh, and, of course, moores' family is inquisitive into sajani's death but still slightly racist to indians. if the tone wasn't so serious, i would be willing to overlook these problems, but it isn't. the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development.  no, this film isn't terrible. other than the laughable screenplay, it isn't poor. the actors are all experienced and perform well here. nandita das, who plays sajani, was part of wonderful indian drama water. even director sivan has an impressive resume. he recently oversaw the terrorist, which is part of roger ebert's ""great movies"" collection. what happened here? why is this movie so bad? well, sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs. apparently, the story was ""timeless,"" and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930's india. i don't have any problem with that approach, but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time. the actors, cinematography, and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan's aura, you'll probably not enjoy it. my recommendation is that you presume you aren't in accordance with him and watch something else. final consensus: *and ½ out of *****",0
"the only reason i am bothering to comment on this movie is to save you all 97 minutes of your life and maybe your money.  i bought it ex-rental for £3.00, it looked interesting, so i took a chance.  within minutes of turning it on i realised i'd made a mistake. the entire cast should be stored away until winter and then thrown on the nearest log fire, where they could meet more of their kind.  as for the devin hamilton (writer and director), he should just be shot, sadly this should have been done before he made this rubbish.  avoid this film, if you see it in the shops run away.  1/10",0
"superficically, ""brigadoon"" is a very promising entertainment package. gene kelly and vincente minnelli, the team behind ""an american in paris"", are reunited with a lot of the great craftsmen and women behind their previous collaborations. gene's leading lady is cyd charisse, one of the best dancers of 40s/50s cinema, and unlike the generally superior ""it's always fair weather"" this film gave them the chance for not only one but two dances. lerner and loewe were the rising team behind such future hits as ""my fair lady"" and minnelli's musical masterpiece ""gigi""; lerner and minnelli had already demonstrated their sanguine collaborative juices on the excellent ""american in paris.""  what happened along the way? why is the movie itself such a stupid bore? minnelli himself didn't want to do the movie, despite his previous warm artistic and personal relationship with lerner. maybe it was because the movie's innate conservatism was just a bit too much of two steps forward for mgm and one step backward for vincente minnelli. but once trapped in this assignment like the denizens of brigadoon are trapped within its city limits, minnelli strove to turn it into something that would be entertaining in a specifically distracting, if not liberating way. the ultimate result is truly horrific to behold.  while aiming for the naive charm of previous minnelli hits like ""cabin in the sky"" and ""meet me in st. louis"", the plaid-tights wearing inhabitants of brigadoon can conjure up none of the illusive nostalgia of those never-have-been locales. its whimsy doesn't even match up to the glossy luster of ""yolanda and the thief"" or ""the pirate"" because the highlands settings seem at the same time too specific for such an exotic fantasy and too generic for real human emotions. the only people in brigadoon who i at least can relate to are the malcontented man who tries to escape and the unfortunate fellow-traveler played by van johnson who accidentally shoots him. the general proceedings in the township of brigadoon itself are too arcane and provincial even to be attributed to a backwards form of christianity: they seem positively pagan in their aspect. for example, in exchange for brigadoon's immortality, the honorable and most generally ""good"" pastor of the town has sacrificed his own place in the supposedly blessed refuge.  at one point we're assured that ""everybody's looking for their own brigadoon."" suffice it to say the box office for this picture confirms my own suspicion that most of us aren't looking for this kind of quasi-queasy paradise. the premise itself is ridiculous and almost insultingly patronizing, but could work if the players were perfect. but kelly himself is the most patronizing thing about the movie, and charisse is horribly miscast as a virginal optimist in much the same way as lucille bremer was miscast in ""yolanda and the thief."" van johnson does his best version of the classic oscar levant sidekick to kelly (even lighting 3 cigarettes at one point like levant in ""aip""), and he provides a lot of amusing moments. but it says something in itself if the best part of a big budget extravaganza with all the best talents of mgm is a tossed-off van johnson performance.",0
"""footlight parade"" is fascinating on so many levels. there is no way the supposedly staged ""theater prologues"" could have been produced in any theater on earth, of course. think of the huge pools and three-story tall fountains for ""by a waterfall,"" for instance. (berkeley directed john garfield in ""they made me a criminal"" six years later and had the dead end kids singing ""by a waterfall"" as they took their showers.)   ""shanghai lil"" is the best production number in the picture. it's a catalog of '30s warner bros. sensibilities. note the african guys mixed into the scene with white and asian prostitutes. you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene in other films of the period unless they were porters on a train or maids in a big house. here the black guys are sitting at the bar and singing with the others. i also get a thrill when the military dancers do a ""card section"" presentation of roosevelt's image. there's also the nra eagle--the logo of the controversial national recovery administration of the new deal. fdr was the new president and hopes were so high that he'd pull the nation out of the depression. you'd never see something so working class oriented coming out of mgm, of course. warner bros. wholeheartedly supported the uplift dictated by the f.d.r. administration.   dear little miss ruby keeler was never better than she is playing the chinese hooker, ""lil."" she hardly even watches her feet as she dances, which was one of her signature flaws.   the pre-code stuff is fun. the ""by a waterfall"" number is wonderful in that regard. the girls change into their bathing suits on the crowded bus speeding through times square with all its lights on. the spread-eagle girls swimming over the camera provide the kind of crotch shots that would not be seen for 35 years. in a few months the production code would eliminate such naughty pleasures.",1
"ok, i overrated it just a bit to offset at least one of those grumpy reviews. but i did enjoy it. i didn't laugh out loud, but it held my interest and pulled me along without dropping me at any point. the story built. yeah, you knew it would have an happy ending--this genre always does. meantime, it was quirky with sight gags you could miss, so pay attention when you watch. stiller and black delivered expertly yet again. good team. they should work together more. don't know that it will be a cult classic, but it was certainly a fun ride. not as good as what about bob, or dirty rotten scoundrels but what is? it is still worth going out of your way a little to get and watch this movie.",1
"spike lee has been in a decline since his early successes and this mess does nothing to help. i looked at my watch frequently hoping the movie would end or get to the point. lee's first movie with an all-white cast is a major disappointment.  what's the point? that italians swear and like funky sex, but not with their wives? if i wanted to see scorsese, i'd go to a scorsese movie. the incredibly lame godfather character only adds to the stereotype.  i've admired several of lee's films, especially ""do the right thing"". this movie is a waste of time.",0

"i have always had the philosophy that every single human being has different tastes, i found this movie to be awesome and i think every college student out there might agree with me. notwithstanding this is not a ""movie with a plot"", its about real guys and some of the ""problems"" that they face. i found the movie hilarious(especially the parts that they played the practical jokes on each other). simply put, if you are in the same ""wave-length"" as these people, you will find this movie amazing. i don't think that this is going win any golden globes or oscars, or that the people in this movie will become future hollywood stars, but its a kind of ""cult-classic"" among young people who could relate to their experience. for me the guy that stands out the most is hans: the scandinavian guy,who ,according to him ""isnt a looker"", but gets all(or some) of the chicks. the ""little-people"" also play a big part in the movie, especially when they are drunk. if i keep going, i might provide a spoiler and i don't want to do that, just go and get the movie and you will not regret. i give it a 8/10",1
"this film was screen as part of the 2007 sydney mardi gras film festival. i had no expectation of the film as someone else choose it for me.  i actually like films that take time to develop, films that allow the characters to unfold and lets the story flow. stillness is good. but this film though was just plain slow.  credit must go to the two main actors. there was a sense of tension between them as two totally different people, misfits really, come together in a very awkward way. there were tender moments and sadness as we learned more about them.  i also liked the setting and the way it was shot. it was claustrophobic and monochrome and it added to the film's intimacy and reinforces the oddness of the characters.  i just don't understand the ending. what was the point of it all?",0
"i'm not kidding about that summary and vote! the video distributors have packaged this as just another typical '80s werewolf movie, but it is in fact the greatest parody of the horror genre that you can imagine, having done for the horror movie what ""blazing saddles"" did for the western. i have seen plenty of comedies - good, bad, stupid, weird, etc. (usually walking away unimpressed), and i think that comedy must be the most difficult genre for filmmakers and actors to work in - it takes just the right kind of touch to make things successful, and part of that is having good ideas. ""full moon high"" is bulging with good ideas - so many, in fact, that it can easily put the zucker/abrams team of ""airplane"" and ""naked gun"" to shame. one of the best of these is the very presence of ed mcmahon in a starring role as a john birch-style right-wing crackpot. the jokes, non-sequiturs, wisecracks and word-play are literally non-stop and everything, including the kitchen sink, has been thrown in. the ironic tone is very similar to that of ""back to the future.""   some people (i.e. almost every reviewer here) must have been turned off by the spirit of anarchy here, but i almost died of laughter, and this is one of those movies in which you never know what kind of insane situation will transpire next. since b-movie extraordinaire larry cohen had not made a straight comedy before this, one gets the sense that he was making up for lost time by including any joke he or his collaborators could think of. if mel brooks had made this, the critics would have labelled it a comic masterpiece, but because it was made by cohen, it has been dismissed as schlock. critical reviews have called this movie too ""silly."" silly? what is a comedy supposed to be - serious?! anyway, i laughed out loud more for this movie than any other i can think of. cohen makes fun of everyone - himself included, with plenty of references to his usual brand of low-rent film-making; he and the actors must have had a complete blast making this.  the humor is very mel brooks-ish, and anyone who loves jewish humor or watches a lot of b-movies (especially horror) will love this. trust me: the movie isn't too hard to find, and as long as you accept it for what it is - a roller-coaster of belly laughs with no pretense of social value whatsoever - then you'll truly enjoy it!!  one sidenote: this movie should somehow go down in history as the one thing bob saget ever starred in (albeit briefly) that was actually funny.",1
"this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description. but to me it was a bit of a let down. very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening. it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed (definitely not in sequential order). also, nothing of any consequence was being filmed. i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer's part, which is different from the typical hollywood film. but this one befuddled me to no end. i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn't do anything for me. i still don't really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey. if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person's life, i guess he succeeded. but i was looking for more. needless to say, i can't recommend this movie to anyone.",0
"on broadway, a chorus line was pure magic. from the second the show opened with a spectacular burst of energy to the truly grand finale, a joyous curtain call of all those chorus members who we grew to love during the course of the show, we were totally engaged - captivated by the intensely personal stories, some funny, some clever, some stirring, of this chorus line. the movie is another matter entirely. the focus is now on the director - and what an ogre he is! every time the film switches to michael douglas, there he is with a bitter, sour expression, barking out questions and orders, screaming and yelling whenever he gets the chance. yikes!! that changes the dynamics of the story. on broadway, the director was indeed an imperious offstage presence, but he was also sort of a theatrical device to allow the stories of these amazing strong/fragile/intriguing/hilarious chorus line members to be told with insight and clarity. there is a reason this work won the pulitzer prize! and actually in one of the only moments the director appears, he is there to comfort the young puerto rican dancer after we hear that dancer's heart-breaking story. he appears again to ultimately express his genuine affection/ concern for cassie. but in the movie, from the second douglas' director starts bitterly barking orders, the chorus line members' stories become secondary. it's like they are in a lousy profession, where a jaded director instead of showing the joy at creating a new exciting theatrical show, is jaded, exhausted, furious at having to audition these chorus members. on stage, there was always the excitement of the show. here in the movie practically from the word go, you feel sorry for everyone involved. during the course of the musical, we desperately wished every single one of those chorus members well, and how happy we would have been if they had all gotten the job! but of course that couldn't happen. but in the finale when they all came back in glorious costume with those amazing spinning mirrors on stage, sometimes reflecting us in the audience, in our hearts, and we know, also in the hearts of all those chorus members both accepted and rejected, they were on stage forever dancing in a profession they loved so much, bringing magic to the theatre. in the movie, after all the misplaced story lines and emphasis, that magic becomes totally diluted. all we feel (even with the exact same curtain call), is that some of the members got a job with a mean-spirited director. so they all come on the screen and are dancing again. big deal.",0
"how powerful and captivating simple quality filmmaking can be. this film tells it's tale with everyday scenes that manage to revel the poignancy hidden within. it's true as others have stated, how this film really makes it glaringly obvious how lost hollywood is in it's special effects, overblown emotionalism and over the top climatic endings and have forgotten the essence of a meaningful story told with simple realism. so much of what these characters are going through is implied by the scene rather than spelled out in wordy dialogue. one aspect that i really enjoyed about the film was the contrast of the two brothers, one so very openly expressive in his childlike way and the other completely stoic but both able to evoke deep emotion. the older brother needed to say little, as he usually did, it was all there in that deadpan face of his! beautiful cinematography, wonderful acting, great direction! not to be missed!",1
"i would not hesitate to put this adaptation of 'death trap"" in a top 5 list of the best stage-to-movie adaptations ever. caine and reeves (an underrated actor who never really got a chance to do more than soggy romances and ""superman"") play off each other extremely well here. even dyan cannon - who i normally don't care for - is perfectly cast in a role that exploits her annoyance value as an actress.  i'm not sure that comparisons of ""deathtrap"" with ""sleuth"" - another brilliant stage-to-screen adaptation featuring michael caine - are valid, or even fair. yes, the two stories have a lot in common. but ""sleuth"" is as much about class warfare as the battle of wits, and the house in ""sleuth"" is set is at least as much a character in the movie as the two actors - the house doesn't really have an equivalent in ""deathtrap"". and ""deathtrap"" isn't so much a battle of wits as it is a pointed vignette about how people are no damned good (and never as smart as they think they are) and deserve everything they get. i'll just say that both movies are superb examples of the genre, and well worth your time and money. this is america, after all. you don't have to choose!   i won't give away the twists and turns of the plot, but i don't think it matters anyway. i've watched the dvd eight or nine times in a dozen years, and still enjoyed the chemistry and the timing and the mean, scary moments when things go ""all pear shaped"". it's all done so well that the ride becomes more important than the actual destination.  anyone who likes black-hearted comedy and suspense in the hitchcock style of film-making will probably enjoy ""deathtrap"" immensely.",1
"10 out of 10, this brilliant, super documentary is a must see, with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years, untill this was screened in 1974. the film clips in this documentary from the war doesn't miss out anything, some of the clips left me dumbstuck. the whole series is over 20 episodes long, and sir lawrence olivier is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war. simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still, and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch. you must watch this at some time, even if it's a few episodes, even at that you will still be blown away at the impact this documentary means to those who have been there suffered and died in the name of war, in a world at war..",1

"this movie, which starts out with a interesting opening of two hot blondes getting it on in the back of a driver-less, moving vehicle, has quite the quirky little personality to boot. the cast of seven (although one girl doesn't hang around for the bodycount, which is unfortunate because the death toll is already so small as is) are all super-hot, as our story centers around teens partying way out in the desert (an odd but effective choice of setting), who are hunted down by a creepy man in black gloves and jeans who drives a black truck. it predates many of the vehicle-inspired slashers to date (""the trip"", ""joy ride"", ""jeepers creepers"") where the killer's vehicle itself becomes an evil antagonist. the killer himself is quite creepy, and we find solace in the extremely likable heroine in jennifer mcallister (look at the interesting symbolic contrast of the evil killer in all black, while our benevolent heroine sports all white attire, as scanty and stonewashed as it may be). director bill crain does some really great things with his camera, some neat tricks on screen, and the cast tries their absolute best. there's enough gore in the low bodycount to please the gore fans, and enough t&a from a couple of the girls to please t&a fans. overall, this flick is highly underrated and widely sought out in the slasher movie world as it's proved quite rare to find on video. highly recommended.",1

"this is so exciting! after i saw ""la roue"" this afternoon, a short, light-hearted little movie, i consider this one a real treat! this is absolutely delightful and one of the most charming pictures i saw this year. it is the more amazing since it is an early talkie and puts some great pictures of the 30's to shame due to its innovative use of sound in cinema. it's simply filled with music and an adorable mood that's really upbeat and, bottom line, it made me happy! obviously it wouldn't be so difficult to retrieve the lottery ticket the male lead was looking for, but the pace is so exhilarating and the movie is so spectacularly entertaining that i didn't even think of it twice. the comedy is many times hilarious and i think it is even superior to the marx brothers, possibly the biggest comedic force of the time. this is rather perfect.",1
"this is a film about life, the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit. i defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie. this is more than just a tear-jerker, its an engaging, thought-provoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially derek luke and denzel washington. 7 years on, i'm amazed that luke is still a virtual unknown and washington only directed one other film. nevertheless, apart from a slow build-up, the story of this foster child's trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it. like many fox searchlight pictures, this was more of a sleeper hit and didn't get the mass critical acclaim it deserves. the scene where antwone finally meets his mother summed up the movie for me, there were so many ways that could have been done and it could have been all schmaltzy or it could have been unrealistic but washington struck exactly the right tone, his mother never said a word and could only shed a tear, while antowne asked simply why. her overwhelming guilt prevented her from saying anything, what could she say to defend herself? one of the most moving cinematic scenes i have seen.",1

"i always follow the dakar, so when my husband bought charlie's 'race to dakar' dvd home i couldn't wait to watch it! of course we'd seen the broadcast of the race when the actual race was on, but that never gives the background and specific teams.  if you watched long way round then you won't be surprised by the language which frankly i find more amusing than offensive.  i think the only thing that annoyed me about the dvd was charlie's hair, but he had it styled before dakar so my feminine need for neatness was assuaged; tho' i could have lived without the 'flame' undies lol as with lwr, the preparation was every bit as interesting as the race itself. i nearly cried when charlie broke his hand, and winced at every bruise he sustained while training....and of course the death of andy caldicott...that was an appalling tragedy, but then every year there's something.  russ drives me nuts, although his attitude has improved a thousand times from the argumentative cynic he was in lwr. it's great to see him get along so well now with charlie.  what i learned from this odyssey was - 1. never let scorpion prepare your vehicle for anything! - they had months to prepare the x5, and still the day before the team left for lisbon, scorpion had only done half of things that needed to be done, and the vehicle was a pain throughout the whole race; 2. the dakar organizers need to put a lot more work into their rider/driver retrieval plan - leaving matt (and presumably a large number of other riders/drivers out to dry the way they did was nothing short of culpable negligence; 3. charlie has an endearing enthusiasm for 'rough and tough' adventure but needs to toughen up a lot to really perform as he'd like; and finally, 4. charlie and ewan are planning another of these epos called the long way down in 2007, and i can't wait to get my hands on it! :d if you love bikes and/or genuinely nice blokes 'having a go', you have to watch this, i guarantee you love it. it's very entertaining.  in conclusion, to simon pavey - you sir are a hero, i was so impressed by the your 'quiet achiever' manner and the fact that you actually finished.....just incredible considering what an monumentally difficult race it is. and to charlie, matt and the rest of the team - full marks for pulling it off. to think that a relatively green team could have achieved so much is truly admirable. you're all wonderful.",1
"jane porter's former love interest harry holt(neil hamilton) and his friend martin (paul cavanagh) come to tarzan's hidden away jungle escarpment searching for the ivory gold mine that is the ""elephant's graveyard"" first seen in tarzan, the ape man...only we soon discover both men have hidden intentions...namely jane. will tarzan stand for that? not likely (in fact tarzan won't even stand for any disturbance done to the ""elephant's graveyard"") and knowing this martin attempts to take tarzan out of the picture only he later finds himself in a world of trouble later he and his party (including jane who leaves with them after she believes tarzan is dead)is captured by a native tribe intent on feeding them to the lions..will tarzan be will and able enough to get to them in time?  this film is adventure filled with loads of scenes involving tarzan and other facing down wild animals and a climax that grips the viewer's interest and doesn't let up. the cruelty displayed towards animals and the portrayal of native people may disturb some today but all should remember this is basically fantasy adventure entertainment and shouldn't be taken so seriously.",1
"i liked chiba in street fighter, and i figured hey, no matter how stupid this movie will be, i'll at least get to see him kick some ass, right? wrong. this is a dull, dreary mess of pointless talking, half-assed scriptwriting and meaningless scheming. there are few action scenes of any kind, even fewer martial arts scenes, and the few that are are shot and edited so poorly that you can't even make out what in the world is going on. the dub is also atrocious, and perhaps the idiocy that is this movie is best illustrated by the fact that it supposedly features the italian mafia... except they're all japanese! avoid like the plague--you would see better martial arts by looking through the window of your local preschool karate class for five minutes.",0
"  the movie ""slugs"" is unique because the titular vermin are actually the good guys in this horrific tale of nature gone awry. you see, these poor slugs have been mutated through the pollution of evil humans and don't mean to do anything malicious, they're just slugs- slugs with sharp teeth who eat flesh and excrete poison, but slugs none the less. the real bad guys are the humans, who either actively try to destroy our beloved slugs, or overreact when they encounter them.  for example, take the scene where the guy puts on the glove full of slugs. they were just hanging out in a comfortable work glove when out of nowhere this giant hand came at them, and they reacted instinctively, defending themselves and biting the guy. now, instead of seeking medical attention for his slug bite, this guy runs around his greenhouse screaming like an idiot, spills some highly volatile chemicals, starts a fire, knocks a bookcase over on himself, and cuts off his own hand- then the fire and volatile chemicals mix and his house explodes. how can you blame that on the slugs?  this movie paints a portrait of humans that is less than favorable. the characters in this movie include the dumb sheriff who hates everybody, the drunk hick who's mean to his dog, and the lumpy sidekick whose wife is at least forty-five years older than him. there's also a set of drunken teens  that get attacked while copulating, and we have to see the skinny long-haired freaks' genitals. meanwhile, there's a guy who looks like a demonic leslie neilson who yells ""you don't have the authority to declare happy birthday!"" for some reason. finally, this parade of loathsomeness is rounded out by the guy from the mst3k classic ""pod people"" whose face explodes after eating a slug-laces salad (another easily avoided fate blamed on the helpful, harmless slugs).  humans are portrayed as greedy, stupid, racist, alcoholic, and, in one pointless scene, as would-be rapists. in the movie's climactic scene, the villainous humans try to burn the slugs who are cowering helplessly in the sewers, well, since they're idiots, the humans succeed in blowing up the entire town. they alone do more damage than the slugs ever did!  if you hate humans, and i know i do, you'll appreciate ""slugs"". if you're a fan of bad cinema, you'll also appreciate this crapfest from the director of ""pieces"" and ""pod people"". there's enough bad acting, silly dialog, illogical plot twists, lame special effects, pointless scenes, and poor dubbing to hold your attention.",0
"in my line of work, i occasionally get contacted by independent filmmakers who are trying to publicize their film. when i can, i take a look at these low-budget films and often they make me think that the future of hollywood is going to the dogs. once in a while, though, there is a film that is born of pure passion and desire, as if created for the purpose of reminding the film industry that good movies are still possible. the short film b r o k e n, directed by alex ferrari, is a genuine surprise and worth a second look.  clocking in at a scant 20 minutes, b r o k e n tries to tell a compelling (but surreal) story with almost no back story. the audience is plopped down in the middle of the action with no clue as to what is happening. a young woman (samantha jane polay) awakens from a dream to hear a gunshot and is subsequently abducted from her home. when she awakes, she is surrounded by a group of mercenary thugs that look like they would be at home in a comic book. these nasty guys and girls are larger than life. they are all guns and knives. there is no way out.  the kicker here is that, despite being a low budget film it doesn't play like one. from the very beginning, the feeling is that b r o k e n has been shot, edited, and produced by professionals. it looks like something quentin tarantino might have done on his day off when he was jamming with the wachowski brothers. the film is sharp and cool, it looks good and it feels like something big.  the acting is much better than i usually see in these smaller films. polay and paul gordon (who plays the head killer, duncan) were well chosen. as two of the few speaking roles in the film, it is up to them to carry the film. no special effects, no matter how good, would have saved this film from bad acting. thankfully, polay manages to convey true fear and gordon manages to come off as a real psycho. some of the more limited roles seem to be filled by lesser talent, but it hardly shows.  the downside to b r o k e n is that it's only 20 minutes long. the story ends with a twilight zone twist that seems a bit contrived and is hardly subtle. watching it, i felt like i was supposed to have some epiphany, but there was only a feeling that it was much more mundane than i had hoped it would be. the film tries hard to be one of those puzzles that leaves audiences talking for hours at the local coffee shop, but it comes off as unsatisfying. i keep thinking that this is the first 20 minutes of a longer film.  my rating: 8 out of 10.",1
"let me start out by saying that i used to really like betty grable, particularly from ""down argentine way"", but by the time she got around to this disaster, she had also got ""round"" and frankly the whole film was an embarrassment. costarred with douglas fairbanks jnr (who must have been fairly desperate) the story was bad, the colours good, and the film far too long. it had some of the old standbys in it like harry davenport and reginald gardiner to try and stimulate interest but with no success. the music score was woeful, and i have to say not one tune was memorable in any way....as i was such a fan of miss grable, i always wish i had never seen this one!",0

"i began watching this movie with low expectations, as a matter of fact i only noticed it because it was an adaptation of a s.k. novel ( a novel i never read).  i'm glad my expectations were low because the movie wasn't nothing close to good, but it manages to keep you interested. what really drags this story down is the work done by the director and the actors. the movie is overlong, hasn't no ""nice"" shots and no scares, the dialogs are dumb and the special effects are crap.  the only things good are that, as i said, it keeps you interested ( i guess the book must be good) without using much horror cliches.  my vote 4/10.",0
"love rosario dawson, think she's one of the finest actresses of the modern era.  descent seems to be more about self-empowerment than anything else. it's the consistent undertone in everything in the film. the dialog is flat, the characters seemingly intentionally bland and one sided. the only consistency is the representation of self-empowerment in the characters and rosario's journey from self empowerment to loss of empowerment and back again.  pitching this as a rape classic isn't appropriate, and that's probably why so many people don't enjoy the film. the standard 'rape' audience wouldn't particularly like this film, and maybe that's the point? the film asks more questions than it answers, and it does confront it's target audience, whether they like it or not. there's a compelling relationship between the characters and the target audience and while the film doesn't slap the audience across the face with self-righteous audacity it does engage the viewer for what may or may not be, all the wrong reasons.  descent is a good film which imho is severely under-rated.",1
"anna (charlotte burke), who is just on the verge of puberty, begins to have strange dreams which start affecting her in real life--especially involving a boy named mark (elliott spiers) who she meets in her dreams.  very unusual fantasy with some truly terrifying moments. despite the fact that this is about a teenage girl and has a pg-13 rating, this is not for children. also, if you hate fantasies stay far away. but if you're game for something different this fits the bill.  well directed by bernard rose with a just beautiful music score and a few nice, scary jolts. the only thing that prevents this from being a really great movie is burke--she's not a very good actress (it's no surprise that this has been her only film) and it hurts the movie. however, everybody else is just great.  spiers is very good as mark; glenne headley (faking a british accent very well) is also very good as anna's mother and ben cross is both frightening and sympathetic as anna's father.  a sleeper hit when released in 1988, it's since faded away. that's too bad--it's really very good.",1
"i remember watching this film, thinking was so interesting. i really wanted to know what happens next. i was amazed by how much they could fit into an 8 minute short. we start in a school yard. . two friends are debating on skipping class. kid b says to kid a ""lets not go to class today."" and kid a declines, claiming they could miss something really important. so kid b skips and kid a goes to class. when he gets there the teacher informs him that today they were going to learn the only and most important lesson they will ever learn. they were going to learn the meaning of life. she gives everyone a pamphlet, and when she gets to kid a, she runs out and tells the boy next to him to share. well, the kid won't share, so kid a goes looking for the teacher. when he finally finds her, he gets a shocking revelation on what the real meaning of life is. i suggest everyone watch this short. it will only take 8 minutes from your life, but the message is so important, it could help you for a life time.",1
"i can fondly remember bo derek's heyday and the uk press attention (the mucky sun & news of the world papers especially)- all following her small role in ""10"" with dudley moore. understandably, much fuss was made of her photogenic face, crystal clear blue eyes and her perfectly formed bouncing breasts.   unfortunately, acting is, and never was, her forte! i think they should make one of the triple disc collections you always find in the bargain dvd bins- orca, tarzan the ape-man and bolero. all these films could be nominated for the ""so bad they are great"".  it would be a guilty ""must buy"" of mine! should you ever read your press, or this comment ms derek, please do not be offended- always had a soft spot for you and there are more important things going on in the world to worry about than your acting ability. much love.x",0
"the movie is a real show of how unemotional and selfish the upper society has become. it has plenty of characters and each and every character is representing a different category of person. no character is 100% good and moral unlike the heroes of all the typical indian movies and no character is 100% bad rather all are just different. the movie is a very perfect mixture of emotions, drama and entertainment. for the very first time i liked a movie that has raised some social questions. i would recommend all to see the movie. madhavi sharma is a journalist who covers those hip-shaking parties of bollywood for the page 3 of the newspaper but this is the story of how she becomes a crime reporter for the newspaper. but this is not all, then it shows how she couldn't survive there and when she helped rescue some innocent children, how brutally her voice is suppressed. even she is fired from the job. then she couldn't find a job of crime reporter and has to do page 3 again. not only her but a very very large number of characters are interwoven in the movie and all gives different feeling while watching the movie. i would really congratulate the director for making such a great movie. please do not afford to miss it.",1

"this service comedy, for which peter marshall (joanne dru's brother and later perennial host of the hollywood squares) and tommy noonan were hyped as 'the new lewis and martin' is just shy of dreadful: a few random sight gags are inserted, everyone talks fast and nothing works quite right -- there's one scene in which noonan is throwing grenades at officers and politicians in anger; they're about five feet apart, noonan is throwing them in between, and the total reaction is that everyone flinches.  in the midst of an awfulness relieved only by the fetching julie newmar, there are a few moments of brightness: marshall and noonan engage in occasional bouts of double talk and argufying, and their timing is nigh unto perfect -- clearly they were a well honed comedy pair.  it isn't enough to save this turkey, alas.",0

"historical drama and coming of age story involving free people of color in pre civil war new orleans. starts off slow but picks up steam once you have learned about the main characters and the real action can begin. this is not just a story about the exploitation of black women, because these were free people. they may not have had all the rights of whites but they certainly had more control over their destinies than their slave ancestors. the young men and women in this story must each make their own choice about how to live their lives, whether to give into the depravity of the system or live with optimism and contribute to their community. i enjoyed all of the characters but my favorites were christophe, anna bella, and marcel.",1
"a wonderful surprise of the spanish cinema. i never thought jordi molla could be such a great director, after all, i really don't care much for his choice in movies. however this film was absolutely fantastic and not predictable at all... something i always enjoy! it hasn't enjoyed much good press and i really don't think it'll ever be released in the us market. we'll have to content ourselves with the dvd or vhs if even that... i don't want to say much about the story because i don't want to spoil it for you but basically the movie is about a homeless drunk who becomes the new messiah just for kicks and to get some money out of it (like sooooooooooo many), before he knows it he is immerse in a life he was not counting on.",1
"right, then, he's absolutely brilliant. but you must be intelligent and quick to understand his humor. he covers (attacks?) all sorts of topics, such as the first moon landing, easter/christmas, transvestitism, movies, and herr doktor heimlich.  for those of you are averse to swearing, this isn't for you. while some of us punctuate with commas and periods, he uses the f-word. also, if you can't laugh at yourself, never watch this; you will feel the fool.  incidentally, i've watched his other stuff and even saw him perform live, and this is by far his best work. he simply shines.  what might go so far as to say he is glorious.",1
"this is an odd film for me, as after i reviewed a nice film from a new film maker (far out by phil mucci), another writer/director, ryan jafri, contacted me and asked me to watch and review his film, the cure. i don't normally review films this way, but what the heck--i love shorts and couldn't wait to see another.  interestingly, while it turned out i did like the cure, i was not thrilled by it and let jafri know. to his credit, he encouraged me to review it anyway--giving it my honest appraisal.  the film has tremendous style and as far as jafri's direction goes, it's exceptional--especially for such an inexperienced film maker (it's his first film). the combination of exceptional choices of color, pacing and music that well-suited the film created a great sense of atmosphere. you really are pulled into the film and that is a credit to the film making. however, the thing i didn't love was some of the writing. while the basic idea was great, the ending was just too easy to foresee. i really would have loved the ending had it come as more of a surprise or there to have been an unexpected twist. however, considering that this film is from someone who shouldn't be able to make such a professional film given his experience, it bodes well for his future. good job.",1
"like the great classic bugs bunny cartoons, this movie has humor at different levels. i just introduced this to my 10 year old daughter and 11 year old son. both enjoyed the movie - busting out laughing quite a few times... and my daughter is not much of a sci-fi fan. the movie kept me laughing despite having seen a few times... the adult-level humor (that is, humor that adults will get simply because of greater life experiences, no baudy or r-rated stuff to be found here) keeps the movie equally enjoyable for adults. for example of the adult level humor, the martian voices are based on characters of different movies/actors. the martian pilot, blaznee, has the voice and mannerisms of jack nicholson; the scientist, that of peter seller's dr. strangelove. the special effects are surprisingly good for this film. the lack of top 10 actors actually works in the movie's favor, and the actors/actresses play their part well - in fact i would say the producers picked out actors and their skills for the roles' needs over box-office draw power (an excellent example is wayne alexander's ""vern"" character). i had to write this review... the kids are playing this for the 3rd time in 4 days over dinner right now. good for a rainy day or a late night weekend there's-nothing-on-and-i'm-bored movie.",1
"i loved that this film recognizes the intelligence of the viewer, allowing the layers to peel from the characters through their interactions with each other about the unspoken loss that has so affected each of them.   the cinematography is a beautiful, and is an inspired reflection of the vision of someone i believe is an extremely talented new filmmaker with the maturity and artistic insight to tell a story that others with much more experience have failed to accomplish. i see a bright future for this writer/producer/director who had the ability to focus on a goal and accomplish it with integrity.  kudos for this achievement.",1
"seeing all of the negative reviews for this movie, i figured that it could be yet another comic masterpiece that wasn't quite meant to be. i watched the first two fight scenes, listening to the generic dialogue delivered awfully by lungren, and all of the other thrown-in oriental actors, and i found the movie so awful that it was funny. then brandon lee enters the story and the one-liners start flying, the plot falls apart, the script writers start drinking and the movie wears out it's welcome, as it turns into the worst action movie ever.  lungren beats out his previous efforts in ""the punisher"" and others, as well as all of van damme's movies, seagal's movies, and stallone's non-rocky movies, for this distinct honor. this movie has the absolute worst acting (check out tia carrere's face when she is in any scene with dolph, that's worth a laugh), with the worst dialogue ever (brandon lee's comment about little dolph is the worst line ever in a film), and the worst outfit in a film (dolph in full japanese attire). picture ""tango and cash"" with worse acting, meets ""commando,"" meets ""friday the 13th"" (because of the senseless nudity and lungren's performance is very jason voorhees-like), in an hour and fifteen minute joke of a movie.  the good (how about not awful) performances go to the bad guy (who still looks constipated through his entire performance) and carrere (who somehow says her 5 lines without breaking out laughing). brandon lee is just there being lungren's sidekick, and doing a really awful job at that.  an awful, awful movie. fear it and avoid it. if you do watch it though, ask yourself why the underwater shots are twice as clear as most non-underwater shots. speaking of the underwater shots, check out the lame water fight scene with the worst fight-scene-ending ever. this movie has every version of a bad fight scene for those with short attention spans and to fill-in between the flashes of nudity.  a bad bad movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",0
"i only saw iphigenia once, almost 30 years ago, but it has haunted me since.  one sequence particularly stays in mind, and could only have been fashioned by a great director, as michael cacoyanis undoubtedly is.  the context: the weight of history and a mighty army and fleet all lie on king agamemnon's shoulders. an act of sacrilege has becalmed the seas, endangering his great expedition to troy. he is told he must sacrifice his daughter iphigenia to apollo in order to gain the winds for the sails of the thousand ships. he initially resists, but comes around, and tricks his wife clytemenstra to bring their daughter to the greek camp in order to marry the greatest of all warriors, achilles.  clytemnestra and iphigenia arrive, find out about the sacrifice, and rage to the gods for protection and vengeance. meanwhile, the proud achilles discovers that his name has been used in this fraudulent, dishonorable way. he climbs a hill to tell iphigenia that he will protect her.  the shot: the camera circles the two young people, without looking directly at each other. they bemoan their fate, and the weakness of men that deceive their loved ones and lust for war. suddenly, they gaze at each other and, for one moment, we feel both their power and beauty, and the unstated--except by the camera--irony that in another time, another place, they perhaps could love each other and be married. it is a sharp and sad epiphany that lasts only for an instant.  what direction! what camera! what storytelling!",1
"every christmas eve i make my kids endure yet another showing of it's a wonderful life. i also thoroughly enjoyed bad santa. so sue me. i admit it. i like cheesy, schmaltzy movies. i like excellent, intelligent ones too, but as with so many things, variety is a good thing. what would the christmas season be without the annual cinematic ka-ching ka-ching of santa in all his guises, from edmund gwenn to billy bob thornton? fred claus will make no one forget bedford falls, but i do not believe a christmas film should have to reach iconic stature to succeed. ""fred"" is a perfectly ok holiday movie, with enough humor for the adults and sufficient charm for the kids. my wife and i laughed a lot, even if most of the humor was obvious and vince was just being vince. paul giamatti was a top-notch santa, which helped a lot. not a great flick, and unlikely to become must-viewing for anyone's annual christmas traditions. but my wife and daughter and i enjoyed it for what it was, holiday schmaltz with a small dash of spice. there's nothing wrong with that.",0
"""witchery"" might just be the most incoherent and lamentably scripted horror movie of the 80's but, luckily enough, it has a few compensating qualities like fantastic gore effects, an exhilarating musical score and some terrific casting choices. honestly the screenplay doesn't make one iota of sense, but who cares when linda blair (with an exploded hairstyle) portrays yet another girl possessed by evil powers and david hasselhof depicts a hunky photographer (who can't seem to get laid) in a movie that constantly features bloody voodoo, sewn-shut lips, upside down crucifixions, vicious burnings and an overused but genuinely creepy tune. eight random people are gathered together on an abandoned vacation resort island off the coast of massachusetts. the young couple is there to investigate the place's dark history; the dysfunctional family (with a pregnant linda blair even though nobody seems to bother about who the father is and what his whereabouts are) considers re-opening the hotel and the yummy female architect simply tagged along for casual sex. they're forced to stay the night in the ramshackle hotel and then suddenly the previous landlady  an aging actress or something who always dresses in black  starts taking them out in various engrossing ways. everything is somehow related to the intro sequence showing a woman accused of witchery jump out of a window. anyway, the plot is definitely of minor importance in an italian horror franchise that started as an unofficial spin-off of ""the evil dead"". the atmosphere is occasionally unsettling and the make-up effects are undoubtedly the most superior element of the entire film. there's something supremely morbid and unsettling about staring at a defenseless woman hanging upside down a chimney and waiting to get fried.",0
"the 1930s saw a vogue for documentary films about remote corners of the world, with an emphasis on wild animals, exotic terrain and primitive people with unusual cultures. despite the logistics of transporting a film crew to a distant and dangerous place, and then bringing 'em back alive (with the film footage), such films were often much cheaper to make than were conventional hollywood features ... because there were no expensive sets, costumes, or high-priced movie stars.  the most successful makers of such films (artistically and financially) were the team of martin e. johnson and his wife osa, who made several documentaries (sometimes with blatantly staged events) in africa and asia. the johnsons' safari films were extremely popular, inspiring several parodies ... most notably wheeler & woolsey's ""so this is africa"", in which the very sexy esther muir plays a character named mrs. johnson-martini (instead of martin e. johnson, geddit?). although several other filmmakers were producing safari documentaries at this time, the johnsons' films were the most popular in this genre because they relied heavily on humour. viewed from our own more enlightened (i hope) standpoint, this is a serious flaw in the johnsons' documentaries: there are too many scenes in which the funny little brown or yellow people are made to look complete idiots who are easily outsmarted by the clever white bwana johnson and his wife.  one definite asset of these movies is the presence of osa johnson. ten years younger than her husband, she manages to seem young enough to be his daughter. while certainly not as attractive as the shapely blond esther muir, osa johnson was a pert brunette who gave ingratiating performances in front of the camera in all the films she co-produced with her husband.  'congorilla' is probably the best of the johnsons' films. the shots of the congo are interesting and have some historical value as evidence of what this environment looked like in 1930. the shots of the pygmies and other natives are also interesting, although these suffer from the johnsons' penchant to stage events in a manner that makes the natives look 'wild' and alien.  the best (and funniest) scene in 'congorilla' is an improvised sequence in which osa johnson attempts to teach a jazz dance to some pygmy women. (the dance is the black bottom, no less ... the same dance which bob hope famously taught to daisy and violet hilton, the conjoined twins.) wearing jodhpurs, riding boots, and a pith helmet, osa johnson starts scat-singing while she does high steps and slaps her knees in her attempt to teach this dance to the african women. meanwhile, they just stand there staring at her, apparently wondering what this crazy white woman is trying to accomplish. it's a very funny scene, but it has unpleasant undertones. osa johnson is doing a dance that was invented by black americans: the implication seems to be that black africans should instinctively be able to perform this dance after a brief demonstration (using natural rhythm, i guess) because it's in their blood, or something.  i'll rate 'congorilla' 4 points out of 10. this film says a little bit about african life in the 1930s and rather more about american cultural perceptions in that same decade.",0
"wow, here it finally is; the action ""movie"" without action. in a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.  there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly ""matrix"" without having the money to do it right. yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.  and, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.  believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. in fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money.",0

""solino"" is about a italian immigrant who arrives in the ""ruhr"" region of germany during the 60s. the immigrant and his family then start the first pizza restaurant in the region. the characters are excellent drawn. especially gigi, the main actor. you live every second, every feeling he does. his brother, played by moritz bleibtreu, isnt that good. well, you just dont believe him the role. but the character is wellbalanced and fits perfectly into this script. i feel an urgent need to compare the style of this movie with the style of ""the godfather"". many people will probably hate this movie, say its boring. not much tension? - yes, but an outrageous movie. 9 out of 10.",1
"***spoilers*** seething with hatred and revenge half breed zach provo, james coburn, had spent the last 11 years on a chain gang planing his escape. what provo want's more then freedom is to even the score with the man who captured him and in the process, during a wild shootout, killed his navajo wife: the former pima county sheriff sam burgade, charlton heston.  making his escape after killing two prison guards provo makes his way towards yuma knowing that that's not just where burgade lives but where his his young daughter susan, barbara hershey,resides as well. using his fellow escaped convicts to lure burgade into the vast arizona desert, by promising them $30,000.00 in gold coins that he buried there, provo plans to exact his bloody vengeance on burgade. but only after having him witness his daughter being brutally raped by his fellow convicts or are, in not being with a woman for years, as horny as a rabbit during mating season!  brutal and very effective western that updates the john wayne 1956 classic ""the searchers"" in a father searching through dangerous indian territory for his kidnapped daughter. charlton heston as the guilt-ridden sam burgade in his felling somehow responsible for killing provo's wife and then having to face the fact that the same thing can very well happen to his daughter susan is perfect in the role of the aging and retired sheriff. charles coburn as the vengeful half breed zach provo is also at his best as the obsessed with hatred and murder escaped convict.  the man who escaped with provo are really not interest in his personal affairs but have no choice, in that he knows the territory like the back of his hand, but to go along with him. it's only the thought of them having their way with susan, when provo gives them the green light, as well as the buried $30,000.00 in gold coins that keeps them from breaking up and going their own way.  also going along with burgade is susan's boyfriend hal brickman, chris mitchum, who proves in the end that he's as good as burgade is, who felt that he just didn't have it in him, in both tracking down the escaped criminals as well as using common sense, which in this case burgade lacks, in doing it.  ***spoilers**** the unbelievably brutal and blood splattered showdown between burgade and provo is almost too much to sit through. provo who's hatred of burgade bordered on out right insanity wanted him to suffer a slow and excruciating death. it was that hatred that bugrade took advantage of and, after taking some half dozen bullets, thus ended up putting the crazed and blood thirsty, as well as mindless, lunatic away for good!",1
"this movie is a fantastic movie. everything about it in my opinion was top notch from the acting to the directing. i know mr. garfield was blacklisted in the 1950's but the majority of his other films are on video if not dvd. that being the case,why isn't this one? a friend recorded it off of tcm for me but to have it on dvd would be great. for special features they could have say a marine historian talk about the battle and if mr. schmid's wife or son are still alive they could be interviewed as well. anyway this is a great movie and i highly recommend it.if it ever is put out hopefully it won't be colorized. colorizing it would in my opinion just ruin the whole effect of the film. the battle scene was quite realistic as far as a 1945,film would go. mr. garfield did a superb job of portraying mr. schmid. some actors might have been tempted to overact the part of mr.schmid's disability but i feel he got it just right. i sincerely hope they come out with this movie on dvd someday as a tribute to the courage of al schmid and all the other marines who sacrificed so much for us in world war two.",1
"a meteor crashes into crater lake, the heat from the impact causing a prehistoric egg to hatch.  alright, so the plot is just trash. but despite its obvious low budget, this comes across as one of the most gripping and entertaining monster-on-the-loose films in existence. there are also some good moments of humor. in an age filled so-called 'monsters' which are no more than laughable men-in-rubber-suit creations or lizards dressed up in frills and forced to rip each other to pieces (cheap exploitation-style), it's refreshing to discover that the plesiosaur in this little gem is an excellent harryhausen-style stop-motion creature.  quite a hard film to find, but it's worth finding.",1
"i enjoyed this film far more than anything had led me to anticipate; from reading other comments here, i suspect it benefits enormously from being seen on a full-size screen in the cinema, in the company of a cheerful and enthusiastic audience. i was lucky enough to have that experience, borne up on ripples of laughter from all around, and had an immensely good time with this undemanding comedy.  for it is as a comedy that it shines, if it shines anywhere at all. the music is nothing special -- in fact, i hadn't realised it *was* a musical, and was very surprised when the assembled ancestors burst into half-spoken lyric -- but i do have to admit that the half-threat, half-promise of 'oh, what i'll do...' has proved far more catchy than it ever seemed at the time, as it's still going round and round in my head!  the plot, such as it is, largely pivots around the past history of the eponymous francesca, a sixteenth-century portrait sporting a distinctly anachronistic hairstyle and fur-coat. her idea on the sanctity of marriage don't quite jibe with those of her distant descendant, the countess angelina, and one can almost hear the storyline creaking at the seams under the strain of the production code in order to ensure that the heroine arrives unsullied in her much-delayed marriage-bed with the right man...  the romance is scarcely earth-shattering, and in fact the first few scenes, played pretty well straight, verge on the tedious. but where script and film really come to life is in the battle of the sexes that follows. the impudence of douglas fairbanks jr's courtship of betty grable's married angelina is equalled only by betty-grable-as-francesca's pursuit of him in turn, culminating in complete role-reversal in the hilarious fantasy sequence where she -- literally -- sweeps him off his feet. this is probably the comic climax of the plot, although the consequences of the colonel's understandable confusion are worked out with a deft touch in the remaining two 'acts' of the operetta-structure, and the spectacle of fairbanks' blissful, bemused awakening is more or less worth the price of admission on its own.  grable is entirely convincing in establishing her two contrasting characters, wisely gets almost all the (limited) singing opportunities, and shares the honours where the swathes of quotable dialogue in the various verbal duels are concerned. but in the field of unspoken reaction she is really outclassed by her male supporting leads; fairbanks in particular is an absolute treat in a number of wordless sequences whose set-up and humour is worthy of the silent screen.  this film is too uneven in style to be a classic, varying from sparkling repartee to hackneyed tedium. but at its best it is quite honestly very funny indeed, and brought a round of spontaneous applause and laughter across the auditorium at the end as the lights went up. out of tune with its times, it may have failed to draw contemporary audiences -- but, on this showing, really didn't deserve to be disowned by both grable and preminger, the (uncredited) director. this is no masterpiece, but a thoroughly entertaining minor work, and i for one found myself grinning in remembrance all the way home.",1
"gere and danes star as 2 workers for the department of public safety who keep track of released sex offenders. gere, who plays babbage, refers to them as his flock. gere is an over obsessed vigilante whom is on his way out. he is training, new comer allison, to take over his job. gere sees his flock as very sick, disturbed puppies. he asks them questions that are not on the list, and tries to act like the police and solve crimes. he keeps getting warned for this behavior, hence the reason he is being replaced. during his final few days on the job, a young girl goes missing, and babbage is sure it is one of his flock whom has gone astray. him and allison narrow a list down and discover some of the offenders have gone awol. so, he decides that he needs to track the missing girl down rather than help the police. that part is a little far fetched.  there is some sick, twisted stuff shown in this film. like when babbage and allison go to this building where a bunch of sick people do disturbing things to each other. also, there are the people who kidnapped the girl. at the end of the film, we see what sick freaks they are. however, i wouldn't call this movie excessive because not really much is shown on film.  final verdict: if you like thrillers and films about serial killers and cops chasing killers, then you will like this.",1
"when sabrina first came onto our screens i was about 12, and therefore spent my teenage years watching the teenage witch get into all kinds of weird predicaments.  it was always one of my favourite programmes, the witchy feeling of sixties sitcom 'bewitched' but this time the character was cooler. i always liked sabrina because she was smart. she was also friendly and easy going which made her enjoyable to watch. the characters at the beginning were great; harvey, jenny, libby, the quizmaster, salem and mr. poole (my personal fave, shame he left so early on) hilda and zelda her aunts started off ok, but then became irritating.  i liked mr. kraft too as he was always that little bit closer to discovering sabrina's secret. what i loved about the first three series was the original ideas, the discovering of the family secret and learning new spells but as it went on it became more predictable. too many characters came and left, such as valerie, dreama and brad and then they decided to do sabrina at college which ruined it for me.  sabrina became self-absorbed at college, there was less magic, no spell book, no aunts living with her and roxie, miles and morgan were annoying.  the last series was boring, and i only watched to see what happened in the end. not having hilda and zelda seemed wrong somehow and miles was gone just like that. the last episode made me feel a lot better though (spoiler)having sabrina end up with harvey on her wedding day to dullard aaron was great! overall a great programme if you forget the poor last two or three series which reminded me of so many teen shows. magical.",1
"one of the most disturbing and tragic periods in american history began. the members of the summer of love culture, at the end of the seventies and onset of the 80's, were eventually tool old for love beads and all night parties and evolved back into mainstream life, whatever that meant. for those who could not out grow their youthful and sometimes irrational exuberance, their's was the culture of wonderland. a love for drugs and a sense of entitlement coupled with a distaste for authority, values and ""the establishment"" is the world that the film captures.   the sixties were a time of revolution and violent change that tore the american ""house"" apart. once the battles were over, we all had to deal with the aftermath of the carnage. the characters in the wonderland house are icons of the misfits of the seventies; part biker, part hippie, part crook, all outcast. no ideology to express, just a sense of dissatisfaction with everything and allegiance to nothing. ron, billy and david fancy themselves as some sort of robin hoods with dope. they talk of love and behave violently; they take from the rich and sell to the misbegotten; they steal from everyone.  holmes and company are the end result of a strange collision of anti-matter like sex, and drugs and rock & roll, when the lab technicians get bored and move on.   the film is skillfully directed and paced and captures the frenetic world of the drug fiends in their element. the fact that holmes is a porn star is almost irrelevant. that story was told in ""boogie nights"". this is a story of a transitional and forgettable era.",1
"this review is for the extended cut of this movie.  i first watched dragon lord when i bought it on dvd many years ago. i always liked this movie and you can read some of the more positive reviews of it to get the general idea.  that being said. i've always found the storyline a bit confusing. the movie is, after all, a love story. and it always seemed strange to me that a love story should end with a 20 minute fight scene.  well, in the extended version this is no longer so. the old ""original"" version begins off with a huge barrel-climb/rugby-like sequence which is the new ending sequence in the extended version. the opening sequence is dragon(jackie chan) hanging around his house and pretending to be training and reciting whenever his father is around.  other sequenced have also been shift or prolonged in the extended cut and the story makes a lot more sense when you watch it. the pacing is also better and overall it just works better. it feels more like a love story and doesn't leave you asking questions about why it ends so drastically and dramatically as the regular version does.  i suggest everyone who is a hong-kong cinema, or just plain jackie chan fanatic to get a hold of the extended version and watch the movie the way it was originally intended.(or at least that's how i think it was intended. why else would they make it and rearrange some of the scenes) when i was done watching it, i felt like i had watched a completely new jackie chan movie although most of the sequences were the same.",1

"'the vampire bat' is definitely of interest, being one of the early genre-setting horror films of the 1930's, but taken in isolation everything is a bit too creaky for any genuine praise.  the film is set in a european village sometime in the 19th century, where a series of murders are being attributed to vampirism by the suspicious locals. there is a very similar feel to james whale's 'frankenstein' and this is compounded by the introduction of lionel atwill's dr niemann character, complete with his misguided ideas for scientific advancement.  the vampire theme is arbitrary and only used as a red-herring by having suspicion fall on bat-loving village simpleton herman (dwight frye), thus providing the excuse for a torch-wielding mob to go on the rampage - as if they needed one.  this is one of a trio of early horror films in which lional atwill and fay wray co-starred (also 'doctor x' and 'the mystery of the wax museum') and like their other collaborations the film suffers from ill-advised comic relief and a tendency to stray from horror to mainstream thriller elements. taken in context though, 'the vampire bat' is still weak and derivative.  all we are left with is a poor-quality frankenstein imitation, with the vampire elements purely a device to hoodwink dracula fans. but for the title the film would struggle to even be considered as a horror and it is worth noting that director frank strayer was doing the 'blondie' films a few years later.",0
"what i hate about this show is how poorly the leads are written. these women have no self-respect or dignity. the entire plot is them throwing themselves at guys. amanda bynes' talent is completely wasted. she was brilliant on ""all that"" and her own show. why they would write her and jenny garth as vapid, airhead, desperate, men chasing, ""old-maid"" wannabes is beyond me.  their plots and dialog remind me of ""the simpons"", homer says whenever his cartoon character poochie is not on screen, ""everyone should ask, where's poochie?"". all the talk centers on whining about some guy, and then whining to some guy. sometimes they change it up and the guy whines instead. then they get back together or break up at the end. the 2 women are either shallow, stupid, or sex addicts. the only word i can think of is ""sucks"".",0
"slackers is just another teen movie that's not really worth watching. dave (devon sawa), sam (jason segel) and jeff (michael c. maronna) are about to graduate from holden university with honors in lying, cheating and scheming. the three roommates have proudly scammed their way through the last four years of college and now, during final exams, these big-men-on-campus are about to be busted by the most unlikely dude in school. the plot is very stupid and there's no reason why to watch this unless your looking to shut off you brain for a little while. slackers is just a predictable teen flick that really adds nothing new to the genre. the comedy in slackers is either hit or miss but there's no real true funny or original moment in the movie. its really just a collection of gags and some are actually pretty funny. though for every joke that works there's at least eight more that don't. the screenplay is full of penis and breast jokes that some high school and college students may enjoy. even if they do they probably won't remember this film after awhile as its not a very memorable comedy. jason schwartzman plays the freaky ethan and after appearing in some good comedies he has stoop pretty low. jaime king and devon sawa are the other main stars but they do a rather poor job in this film. this is directed by dewey nicks and this is his first film so you can't blame him too much. the funniest character was probably laura prepon though, she's not in the movie very much. the film is very short at only 86 minutes long however, that may be too long for some people who don't really like this type of humor. slackers isn't the worst film of 2002 but certainly is below average. when compared to other films in the genre there's a lot better out there such as not another teen movie, american pie and its sequels , scary movie 1 & 2 etc. so unless you have seen most of them and you're looking for something new then slackers might fit that bill but its better if you just watch something else. rating 4.3/10 a below average teen comedy that's worth skipping.",0
"this movie is a total dog. i found myself straining to find anything to laugh at just so i wouldn't feel like i'd totally wasted my money--and my time. the writing in this film is absolutely terrible. it's a shame it's not up to the standards of other hale storm movies.  they should have saved the money on getting d-list actors like fred willard and gary coleman and spent the money working the script until it was right. even gary coleman wasn't properly utilized for his role.  this movie leaves you wondering what the point of most of the plot was--including the subplots. after viewing this movie, i'm left with the impression that the producers were hoping to capture some kind of napolean dynamite-like humor, where it's not so much the lines as the character and the delivery. unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver the lines, the characters, the delivery or the humor. i should have gone to the dentist instead!",0

"i'd like to start off by saying that i am not an anime fan (with a few notable exceptions), and i generally have a low opinion of so-called otakus, as they are so in love with their particular brand of cartooning that they label every movie starring spiky-haired, big-eyed characters as a work of art without even considering other more vital factors, such as the plot. and no anime movie better represents this division between otakus and people with actual taste than this elegant piece of trash, fatal fury: the motion picture.   as seen through the glassy, witless eyes of an otaku, there's little to find fault with in fatal fury-- there's plenty of quirky japanese-y humor, one-on-one duels, some ""dramatic"" moments, and everything is beautifully drawn. but everyone else will be turned off by the cliched, predictable plot with cliched, predictable characters, culminating in a cliched, predictable ending. the love scenes are hilariously overblown-- the scene in which sulia ""heals"" terry is obviously intended to be a tender moment, but it's virtually impossible to not be thrown into spirals of giddy laughter by the sheer ludicrousness of it. and of course, fatal fury is not without the obligatory cartoon t&a-- this is supplied gratuitously by the huge-breasted mai shiranui. and since fatal fury is based off the video game series of the same name (oh boy), we're treated to numerous pointless cameo appearances by popular characters with little or no relevance to the plot whatsoever (they go through all the trouble of introducing kim early on, only for him to disappear from the movie totally after that point). this mess of a movie reaches its climax with the unintentionally farcical final battle, in which all the main characters engage the all-powerful main villain in one-on-one combat in turn. that's some thing that's always amused me... even when battles in animes aren't taking place in a tournament, they always happen as if they were, regardless of the fact that it makes no sense whatsoever!   otakus always rave about how anime movies should be treated as movies as opposed to merely cartoons, and a disturbing portion of those same people love fatal fury. so would fatal fury have been good if it wasn't an anime? the answer is an emphatic ""no""-- all of this movie's charm, what little of it there is, resides in the actual drawings. had fatal fury not been an anime, it would have been worthy of an episode of mystery science theater 3000, if the show was still on the air. that's the key-- this is nothing more than a laughably bad b-movie in the guise of an anime epic. if you're a fan of movies so bad that they're actually entertaining, consider renting fatal fury (or catch it on the sci-fi channel), as it is definitely one of those. if you're an otaku, please wake up and realize that a good 90% of the stuff you're watching is garbage. as for everyone else, buy a dreamcast and fatal fury: mark of the wolves, but don't even consider seeing this movie.",0

"i still liked it though. warren beatty is only fair as the comic book hero. what saves this movie is the set, the incredible cast and it offshoots a mediocre script. i really expected something more substantial in the terms of action, or plot but i got very little. the main reason to watch this movie is to watch some of the biggest stars in hollywood at the time in such an unusual film.   the one person who did a terrible job and did not even belong in this film was madonna. she did not belong in this movie and her acting job was pretty bad. the movie at some points just stood still. you expected something more and you got nothing. al pacino plays a really bad dude and he does pretty good. he and beatty do make an excellent good guy and bad guy.   it is also interesting to see dustin hoffman, and warren beatty in a film other than isthar. i did not see ishtar but i heard bad things. the thing about this movie is it is good, but it could have been so much better. i liked it as a child because i thought it looked cool, and visually the movie is amazing, the sets are incredible, the writing is only fair, and with such a cast in the movie i would expect a little better anyway.   spoiler  i especially thought the finale was not big enough. it was interesting but for such a grand scale film i just thought it could have ended with a little more of a bang. the reason to watch this movie is the atmosphere. the movie only uses the 7 comic book colors making it all that more excellent visually anyway.  the costumes and makeup were flawless as well. the facial makeup for the villains was great. beatty is just not up to such a bigger than life character. still, this is a good movie that could have been much much more. it is to me better than batman, the other comic book adaptation that came out close to the same time. of course that movie was much bigger in terms of gross.",1

"so often with stephen king adaptations, you just get a collection of characters reciting dialogue from the books. this really captures the heart of the book. maybe because they don't use large chunks of text straight from the book, but it's a bit more of an improv of the events in the story. a big part of its success is miko hughes as baby gage. dale midkiff and denise ""tasha yar"" crosby really act like his parents. there's a scene where louis is cuddling gage, and they are very natural together. fred gwynne is wonderful. he nails the maine accent perfectly without lapsing into parody, and is wise and warm just like jud should be.

"for those fans of laurel and hardy, the 1940s and beyond were a very sad time for the team. their contracts with hal roach studios had expired and now they were ""free agents""--able to work for any studio who offered them a job. unfortunately, fox, rko, mgm (without roach) and even a french film company who hired the boys had absolutely no touch for their comedic talents. plus, stan and ollie were a lot older and seeing these geriatric men taking pratfalls seemed sad, not particularly funny. stan looked very ragged and ollie's weight had ballooned up to the point where he could barely walk--and so it made me feel uncomfortable laughing at their very, very sedate antics.  in addition to their age, this particular film suffers because fox studios oddly cast them in a supporting role and created a parallel plot involving a young couple--something that reduced their time on screen and turned them into insipid ""hangers on"" instead of just being themselves. a cute and cuddly stan and ollie is very foreign to the old laurel and hardy of the 20s and 30s--and just seemed awfully strange and suited them poorly.  now even with their age, this could have been a decent movie if it had been given decent writing and if it appeared the studio cared--and it's quite obvious they were using the ""b unit"" here--with, at best, second class support. in particular, there are very few laughs and the last 10 minutes of the film is simply dreadful--relying exclusively on a sloppy rear-projected screen for the stupid chase scene--which might just rank as one of the worst of its kind in film history.  for mind-numbed zombie lovers of laurel and hardy, it's probably a film they will love. but, for lovers of the team who are willing to honestly evaluate this film relative to their amazing earlier films, it simply comes up wanting indeed. in fact, of all their full-length films pre-1940, i can't think of one i liked less than dancing masters. unfortunately, of the post-1940 films, this might just be one of their better ones. sadly, it got a lot worse--with wretched films like the big noise and nothing but trouble. i just wish the boys had just retired after saps at sea.  finally, i wonder if all the generally positive reviews for this film on imdb might reflect the reviewers' love of the team more than it's an indication that this is a good film? for an audience who are not already in love with the team, i don't know how this film will do anything but bore the audience--it certainly won't convince anyone that laurel and hardy were comedic geniuses. but even comedic geniuses need material worthy of their talents.",0
"a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom. it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john livien's traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche. instead, it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john livien's life with john lennon's. john livien's suicida mother's hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself. instead of focusing on john lennon's musical brilliance, and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life, it showed lennon's legacy to be that of a confused, drug addicted soul, who should looked upon as a god instead a man. i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another ""crazy"" person obsessed with lennon, lennon's killer , mark david chapman. lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon. do we need to be reminded of that? john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person, as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon, and not show his beautiful contributions to the world. yoko ono graciously honored john lennon's memory,by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects, and remember john. instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide. i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennon's memory. he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death, and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan. it ruined the movie completely for me . it could have been a decent movie, but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. let john lennon, and his family rest in peace and not be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie.",0
"i am a big fan of fred macmurray and carole lombard. and, in addition to them, charles butterworth (a very enjoyable supporting actor) was in this film,...so why didn't i particularly enjoy it?! well, despite a good cast, this is one of the poorest written and most clichéd ""a pictures"" i have ever seen. given the talent and money spent to make this film, it is shocking how slip-shod the writing was. i knew the film would be tedious when time after time early in the film i found myself predicting exactly what would happen next--and i was always right! and this isn't because i am some sort of ""movie savant"", but was because almost no imagination or effort went into it. in fact, it seemed almost as if the film was just a long string of clichés all strung together! also, i found it a bit irritating that fred mistreated carole so bad throughout the film and yet, true to convention, she came running to him in the end. uggh! there is more suspense in a lassie film (""will he bring people to rescue timmy or will the rope he is dangling from break?"").  despite the very, very tired and clichéd script, there were a few positives about the film. it was pretty cool seeing fred look like a broken lush at the end of the film--it was pretty believable and he looked like he hadn't eaten, shaved or slept in days. also, charles butterworth's ""prattle"" did provide a few mildly humorous moments. but all this just wasn't enough to make this film look any different than a ""b movie"". it's a shame,...it could have been so much better.",0

"lame, lame, lame!!! a 90-minute cringe-fest that's 89 minutes too long. a setting ripe with atmosphere and possibility (an abandoned convent) is squandered by a stinker of a script filled with clunky, witless dialogue that's straining oh-so-hard to be hip. mostly it's just embarrassing, and the attempts at gonzo horror fall flat (a sample of this movie's dialogue: after demonstrating her artillery, fast dolly shot to a closeup of barbeau's vigilante charactershe: `any questions?' hyuck hyuck hyuck). bad acting, idiotic, homophobic jokes and judging from the creature effects, it looks like the director's watched `the evil dead' way too many times.   i owe my friends big time for renting this turkey and subjecting them to ninety wasted minutes they'll never get back. what a turd.",0
"shocking!  in 1965 i saw jury gagarin alive. he was sincere, unpretentious and kindly, he was at ease and looked like well-educated and intellectual person. in this movie i saw a clown! the actor looks like dummy with affected gestures and mimicry. they made a cartoon! the real gagarin was someone else! don't believe in this movie!  i saw this movie after the movies like ""taming of fire"" and ""apollo 13"" and after reading books ""rockets and people"" by chertok and ""korolev: myths and facts"" by golovanov. i was shocked by tiresome scenario, poor acting and producing, and a lots of inexactitudes of ""space race"".  the movie is the tedious rendering of well-known in russia historical facts. a lots of interesting known facts of the space projects was not demonstrated. some facts and details were perverted. for example, in 1945 korolev was already not a prisoner (liberated in 1944), and in 1940 he was already not in kolyma prison gold mine, but in special prison design bureau. korolev was the designer in prison design bureau and he was not buried the dead prisoners. but in the movie korolev worked as grave digger after 1940 (because jailer have shoulder straps on uniform). imho, the authors of movie have no profound knowledge about this part of the history and they can't to make interesting movies.",0
"the mind boggles at exactly what about universal soldier merited a sequel. since the real star, dolph lundgren, would not be able to reprise his role from the original, there is already scant reason to indulge oneself in this obvious tax write-off. bold attempts are made to fill the gap with professional wrestler bill goldberg and martial arts expert michael jai white. to their credit, they give their action sequences a good sense of excitement. bill goldberg looks like he is having the time of his life on this film, and he makes a fair stab at filling the requisite comedic villain role. for once, his role is the kind that involves repeating the same line a few times, and it does not get irritating. the problem from the audience's point of view is that neither of these gentlemen really have the sense of comic timing or minor humility that makes lundgren such a pleasure to watch in almost all of his films. and therein lies the problem. you do not go to see a van damme film because you want serious action. you go because you want comedy, however unintentional.  unbeknownst to many people, universal soldier was followed by two direct-to-video sequels. i have only seen the first, which had production values so bad one can only wonder if it was meant to be some kind of elaborate joke. matt battaglia was so terrible in the role of luc deveraux that for once in his career, the sight of jean-claude van damme comes as a welcome relief. the film more or less completely disregards the stories of the aforementioned direct-to-video sequels, and instead begins a whole new story set an indeterminate time after the events of the original. after years of investigation and explanation, the unisol project is still going ahead, with some minor modifications. for one, the new unisols are stronger and more damage-resistant than their earlier cousins. for another, all of the unisols are now under the direction of a supercomputer called seth. in the early parts of the film, seth exists primarily as a series of abstract graphics within a glass dome.  being that the film barely lasts more than eighty minutes, we are quickly told that funding to the military is being cut. the unisol project is on the chopping block, which essentially means that seth will be turned off. seth, somehow overhearing this conversation through means that are never really explained, decides to mobilise the unisols as an army against those seeking to shut him down. his only problem is that every so often, a code is required to be put into his system in order to prevent automatic shutdown. two individuals possess the code in question. seth kills the first in short order, and those who are familiar with the plot kit that van damme's films are constructed out of will guess within five seconds who the second happens to be. the rest of the film revolves around the unisols' attempts to get the code out of van damme without injuring him too badly. a subplot with a daughter and a reporter is woven into the film, but it adds about as much to the story as van damme does to the profession of acting.  the film is loaded to the brim with ridiculous lines and clichés. when seth transplants his command module into the body of michael jai white, we get a speech about how the time of the humans is over. he goes on to tell his foot soldiers how fear and mortality will be humanity's weakness(es). gee, seth, you mean they will not be our strong points? all kidding aside, the short length of the film is both the film's weakness and its strength. it leaves the action without adequate setup. in the original, we are given a very thorough explanation of the unisols, how they work, and how they are brought to the state that is seen in the majority of the film. here, the writer seems to take it for granted that the viewer knows what a unisol is and how they operate. at least in the original, a moment of curiosity and wonder was created by leaving the explanation for later in the film when the hero lies in a tub of ice. here, one of the villains is shot with a gun that leaves massive holes in his uniform (and presumably his body), getting up every time without stopping for breath.  i tend to reserve the score of one for films that are so bad that they become entertaining in a completely unintentional manner. if you can see it on the cheap, knock yourself out. this is the kind of film that makes me mourn the loss of mystery science theatre.",0
"1914 was an amazing year for charlie chaplin. it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films! while most of these films weren't particularly good, they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona. however, by this film, the familiar ""little tramp"" character was still in development. sure charlie looked the part, but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed. instead, chaplin often hit, kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly no reason at all.  as for this very slight film, it is interesting to watch for the cast. while they are not familiar today, chaplin stars along with mabel normand, chester conklin and mack swain--all exceptionally popular stars with keystone films. the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes, the plot seems very vague and improperly developed. chester and mabel got to the race track (a very common theme in keystone productions--it must have been located near a race track). charlie and mack show up and sneak in. mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl. in the end, for no apparent reason, the cops take chester and mack away--leaving charlie with mabel (who, oddly, didn't seem put off by charlie's boorish behaviors).  unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian, this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin. what he and the other actors actually do on stage, while not unusual for a keystone film, isn't particularly funny when seen today.",0
"this is a very good spanish movie but i am worried that many out there will feel lost because many around the world have no idea what the spanish civil war was all about or when it was fought. being a history teacher, i had a big advantage but could easily see how the film could be confusing until you piece together all the pieces. i doubt if this would be a big concern in spain where this film was made, but for other audiences they may be a bit confused until later in the film.  the movie begins with 12 year-old carol and her mother returning to her mother's home town. years have passed and you gather that they are coming to spain from new york city. despite the strangeness, carol speaks reasonably good spanish and much of the film is about how she adapts. as for why her and her mother are alone, i'll spill it now for those who don't pick up on the fact that carol's father is fighting in the war on the side of the republicans (who eventually lost in this very bloody conflict).  the movie gets exceptional marks for its lovely camera work and music. the rather slow and rambling pace isn't bad provided you are someone who can accept films this way. i have seen several other spanish films about this war and this compares pretty well to them--not better or worse--just a decent slice of life film about those who are left behind as well as a nice coming of age flick.  ps--if you don't know which side is which, the republicans were mostly socialists and they were backed by the soviet union and mexico as well as volunteers from many countries (including the usa). the nationalists were led by franco and were aided by portugal and the fascist states of germany and italy.",1
"i didn't know what to expect from 'ned kelly', but absolutely loved it. it was dark, dramatic and gripping. it also felt very authentic, i felt that i had been transported back to the 1800's. i've never been much of a heath ledger fan, having only seen him in teen type movies, however he is quite compelling in this role. ledger plays ned kelly with dignity and intensity, showing us how an highly spirited boy became australia's most notorious killer. naomi watts is great in a supporting role as kelly's society lover. highly recommended - and that's from an aussie!",1

"i never watched the 'next action hero' show, and until reading the other comments here, did not know that this movie was the 'prize' from that competition. i was just flipping channels and came across this, and found myself watching, dare eagerly, all the way to the end.  yes, the plot's been done (the most dangerous game, etc.) but i was hoping for, and almost received, the 'gotcha' - how the protagonist was going to beat the hunter in the end. i think the high-tech was overdone (gps's) and gave me cold-sweat flashbacks of night rider, but it nevertheless was not too overdone.  the basic problem i had with this movie was the degree of sod (suspension of disbelief) that was required of the viewer. do we really think that someone flying in a helicopter could lob countless incendiary grenades at a public bridge and no cops show up to investigate? could a limousine do countless donuts in a las vegas intersection and no cops show up? pleeease. way too much of that type of thing - fun to watch, but keep it at least plausible, thank you very much.  the final solution was good, but the ending was disappointing, with the after taste of a bad star trek episode. at least now i understand why the acting was so cheesy - except for zane, who doesn't get near as much work as he deserves imho - they were winners from a reality show.  knock me out.",1
"a lonely depressed french boy mathieu (jeremie elkaim) on vacation in the summer, meets and falls in love with cedric (the gorgeous stephane rideau). quiet and slow this is a very frustrating movie. on one hand, i was absorbed by it and really felt for the two boys. on the other i was getting annoyed--the film constantly keeps flashing around from the past to the present with no rhyme or reason. it's very confusing and pointless.   spoilers ahead!!!  also there are tons of plot holes--mathieu, at one point, does something that ends him up in the hospital. what is it--we're never told! then he breaks up with cedric and tells everybody else he's living with him. why? we're not told. then he hooks up inexplicably with another guy at the end. why? no explanation. it's clear cedric loves mathieu and mathieu is living in the same town so... however it is a tribute to the film that you really care about the characters so much. if only things were explained!  elkaim as mathieu is not good. he's tall, handsome and has a nice body--but he can't act. his idea of acting is sitting around with a blank look on his face--all the time. rideau, on the other hand, is great. he's very handsome, has a very nice body and is one hell of an actor. also he has an incredible sexual magnetism about him. there is full frontal male nudity, lots of kissing and a fairly explicit sex scene in the movie which is great--most movies shy away from showing male-male love scenes. this one doesn't and it helps to see how the characters care and feel for each other.  so, a frustrating film but somewhat worth seeing--especially for rideau's nude scenes--that is, if you like good-looking nude young men!

"good times was a groundbreaking comedy about the first nuclear black family living in the chicago projects. whether or not, you live in the inner cities, ghettos, suburbs, or rural countryside, this show is still a treasure to watch and observe a family being just a family rather than a show about a poor black family. but they don't dwell on it. they find humor and have strong family values and morals. despite the story behind the scenes, this show was worth keeping on the air except i didn't like them killing off the father which i agreed with esther rolle who fought hard to keep the family together. but despite all the fights behind the scenes, good times was a show about a family. we all loved jj's dynamite and his antics. we watched janet jackson's penny grow up a little. this show was groundbreaking to show despair in drugs, gangs, and alcoholism. without being to preachy, the evans always tried to do the right thing rather than do something wrong to get out of the ghetto.",1

"hello playmates.i recently watched this film for the first time ever and it is also my first experience of arthur askey, i have to admit i was very impressed by this film. as a fan of black and white films generally, passport to pimlico, the lavender hill mob and tommy trinder (who is apparently a distant relative), this film appealed in that it provided good old fashioned british humour. i notice that there are some on here who have criticised askey's performance, however in my opinion it stands the test of time as a fine example of forties comic acting and if anything adds to the picture by creating characters that are more than the mere stereotypes which seem to so dominate films now.if you can get hold of this film i would recommend you get hold of it,shame these films generally aren't shown on sunday afternoons anymore.i am also glad to have had the opportunity to watch another piece of work by arnold ridley (private godfrey in dad's army).i thank you",1
"solino really moved me with its deeply drawn characters. while being a simple tale of rivalry between two brothers, it was not simply about hate or jealousy. what i liked most about the movie was how i could identify with the feelings gigi was going through especially when he had to take his mother back to her home town in italy and miss out on attending the festival film awards ceremony his film was entered into. to see this character who struggled so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother was so frustrating. even at the end when he makes one more attempt to reach out to his father was so brave. and as in real life, most fathers can never get past their walls to reach out to their children. i could even identify with giancarlo, the brother, who while being the more self assured and elder brother, had so many insecurities. a really beautiful film that made me laugh and cry.",1
"unlike endemol usa's two other current game shows (deal or no deal and 1 vs. 100), the pacing in this show is way too slow for what is happening on the screen.  dond and 1 vs. 100 can get away with slow pacing because the games can change pace--or end--at any moment. there is risk involved in every action the player takes, the rewards are wildly variable, and it is difficult for the players to leave with a significant amount of money. suspense is usually put to good use.  show me the money, on the other hand, is just too slow-paced. when a question is revealed and it is obvious that the player knows the correct answer, you can rest assured that absolutely nothing exciting will happen in the next few minutes. it would greatly help the pace of this show to reveal the correct answer first, and then have the player select a dancer, instead of shat wasting time talking about what will happen if the player gets an answer wrong when we all know they're right. the random dancing is filler that actually feels like filler. too much time is wasted while not enough is happening... and the fact that players cannot choose to quit the game early guarantees that there will be a lot of time wasted.  oh, and i have no interest in watching shat shake his groove thang, especially right after i've eaten dinner.  i am a lifelong game show fan, but even i had a lot of trouble sitting through an hour of this. it either needs major changes or early retirement.",0
"the film's design seems to be the alpha and omega of some of the major issues in this country (u.s.). we see relationships all over at the university setting for the film. befittingly, the obvious of student v.s. teacher is present. but what the film adds to its value is its other relationships: male v.s. female, white v.s. black, and the individual v.s. society. but most important of all and in direct relation to all of the other relationships is the individual v.s. himself.   i was amazed at how bilateral a point of view the director gave to showing the race relations on campus. most films typically show the injustices of one side while showing the suffering of the other. this film showed the injustices and suffering of both sides. it did not attempt to show how either was right, although i would say the skin heads were shown a much crueler and vindictive (quite obvious towards the end). the film also discusses sex and rape. it is ironically this injustice that in some ways brings the two races together, for a time. lawrence fishburne does an over-the-top performance as the sagacious profesor phipps. he crumbles the idea of race favortism and instead shows the parallelism of the lazy and down-trodden with the industrious and positive. other stars that make this film are omar epps, ice cube, and jennifer connelly. michael rapaport gives an excellent portrayal of a confused youth with misplaced anger who is looking for acceptance. tyra banks make her film debut and proves supermodels can act.  higher learning gets its name in showing college as more than going to class and getting a piece of paper. in fact, i would say the film is almost a satire in showing students interactions with each other, rather than some dry book, as the real education at a university. it is a life-learning process, not a textual one. i think you'll find ""higher learning"" is apropos to the important issues at many universities and even life in general. 8/10",1

"i must admit that i have been a sucker for samurai flicks since i can remember. i used to watch rather indiscriminate, be it ""elitist"" works like the seven samurai or the bloody comic-book variation like lone wolf and cub. i also liked us-/japanese ""crossovers"" like the bushido blade. and of course everything containing sonny chiba and hiroyuki sanada. and i've virtually watched every samurai at least twice. but not kabuto.  in 1993 i first watched kabuto on video, that even samurai films can be boring. in the beginning i was looking forward to mayeda reaching europe and the confrontations that would come from that but by the time he actually reached spain, i really didn't care so much for the movie anymore.  it wouldn't do the film justice to call it ""bad"". technically it's a clean entry into the genre. but there is simply never quiet enough. sho kosugi has limited skills as both director and actor and has only a fraction of above mentioned japanese actors charisma. and speaking of sho kosugis son kane, who appears in almost all sho kosugi films as shos son: he has inherited little-to-none of his fathers limited acting skills. adding to the minus-points is the absence of the blood and gore that until then was a trademark of all samurai film. this was obviously intended for a younger us- / european audience.  lets just say that it's a so-so film for the average historic-action-adventure fan but a bore for hardened fans of samurai cinema. fans who are into the ""samurai meets ""-genre, should rather go and watch red sun (1971), featuring charles bronson as cowboy who has to team up with samurai toshiro mifume to retrieve a samurai sword from bad-guy alan delon. it pretty much how to do it right and where kabuto went wrong.  so, even though the film is a mere 100 minutes, it seems like a much longer film.  the reason i gave this a honourable 4/10 points instead of 3/10: first time i saw this film, i saw it in the german synchronized version. in this version, kosugi can actually be understood. i must admit that his 'engrish' is at times funny but gets tiresome after about 30 minutes.",0

(and his character ""homer simpson"" makes me wish for the animated version. d'oh!) then you had the creepy child actor, the creepier billy barty, and so on.  this is one of those films cinema buffs love and the rest of us look at each other and go, ""what the heck!""",0
"this picture reminds me of a keneth more picture from 1957 called the admirable crighton"" whilst on the boat he was a servant and on the island he became the master and upon being saved reverted back to servant. madonna did ok in some movies however this one doesn't fire. if there is any picture that show madonna can't act it is this one.  i am not sure whether this was a subtle copy of ""the admirable crighton"" but it sure looks like it and if thats the case then hollywood must be running out of ideas and that is sad. to provide a platform for actors to improve their career profile and just on that this fails in every corner and detail.  the plot is loose and the acting is mediocre. the script should have been put thru the shredder before taking it on location. while many here have canned madoona for all her acting i think that in films like ""a league of their own"" was quite good and enjoyable and ""who's that girl"" showed a quirkiness of madonna's style not shown before or afterwards. other madonna films are not as enjoyable and i would have liked a to see a madonna animation series with the character from ""who's that girl"" i like the music from these two films however ""swept away"" remains at the bottom of the pile here and will remain so.  everyone has a bomb right?",0
"i couldn't believe this terrible movie was actually made at all. with the worst actors you could find, the worst script written (mark frost & sollace mitchell) and by far the worst waste of time in viewing. i won't belabor the story as it's really not worth it. but i will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story. as to the story, it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did. that in reality the wife couldn't defend herself against a little bitty of a thing. that the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all. that the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up. and the final result of the film is an insult to justice, movie codes, and the male species. the theme of this mess is let women do as they wish, kill whom they want, defend the killer and get away with it, while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim. hard to believe that sollace mitchell, the director and a man, would even want to make this dribble.  as to the acting: jordan ladd, the killer, is awful. a loony toons, who does needlepoint during her murder trial (is this allowed in court?) she bored me to the hilt. one more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and i'd throw up. she's not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife. the husband, played on one level by vincent spano, just seems to look and act stupid most of the time. he was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him. the worst by far was holland taylor as the defense attourney. she over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice. if she would cross examine me anytime, i'd have told her to go take a hike. everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do so.  i wish i could give this film a zero rating. however we are forced to start with 1. too bad. let's not have anymore painful watching films like this. lifetime can do better then this, i know it.  this is a postscript: made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake. as soon as i saw the bimbo jordan ladd i knew i'd seen it before and didn't like it or her. i not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like sollace mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick. doesen't anyone see that her/his message is that sickness pays. being ill and going around killing people is okay with this director/writer. totally making the male species idiots. well, this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful. we're not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie, which in this person's mind deserves to be trashed.  and again this loser is shown. why???? can't you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie? are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo jordan ladd again and again? get her off tv, films and out of sight. she's just terrible in every sense of the word. phew!!!!",0
"this, is not one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe i have ever scene, the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries, but without the sex, the only reason i bought this was i wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one i could find, possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever, the soundtrack is really tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films, why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me, if they had really attempted to make an original movie and failed i would be nicer in this review but they don't they just got the rights to reproduce stuff from the first two and then edit it and repeat it into this film with about maybe under 1 3rd original footage which is about up to the standards of film school students, do not buy this movie. the only entertainment this dvd can offer is if you were to stick it in the microwave and watch the flashing lights! utter utter utter uttter unbelievable garbage! 0/10 if only the voting system would allow that.",0
"this is so incredibly bad. poor actors. you can tell they're trying really hard to polish a turd, but we all know you can't. the writing is so obvious and facile, it's sad watching them try to sell it. the humor and pacing are so labored, it's hard to believe any of these good actors signed on for this.  that said, it's so awful that we're having a hard time looking away from the screen. we just have to know where this trainwreck goes. but that's only because we caught it on tv. if we had actually paid for this, we'd be disgusted.   so it gets 2 stars for being at least amusingly/fascinatingly bad. and the incidental music (as opposed to the trying-too-hard indie soundtrack) is laughably reminiscent of an episode of scooby-doo... but not as good.",0
"don't understand how these animated movies keep coming out, and no matter how good (or bad) it is people love it.  i saw this movie with my two kids (5,7). they like pretty much anything animated (like most people who rated this film). the theater was almost full, and i looked forward to seeing the movie with its superb cast. to tell the truth i was bored silly. it was unbelievably predictable and just plain unfunny. there were a couple chuckles throughout the film and that was it. of course they tried time and time again to get the cheap laugh, but just didn't work. my son almost always says to me that he wants the dvd after we see an animated movie, but not on this one. my daughter fell asleep half way through. also, the kids thought the character animation looked weird. i haven't heard that from them since seeing the polar express, which gave my daughter nightmares.  trust me, i'm not the type who looks for the negative in everything. but quality is quality, and like so many animated movies they throw out there, it has very little.",0
"this movie never made it to theaters in our area, so when it became available on dvd i was one of the first to rent it. for once, i should listened to the critics and passed on this one.  despite the excellent line up of actors the movie was very disappointing. i can see now why it went straight to video.   i had thought that with bloom, ledger, and rush it could have some value. all have done wonderful work in the past.   the movie was slow moving and never pulled me in. i failed to develop much empathy for the characters and had to fight the urge to fast-forward just to get to the end.   i do not recommend this film even if you are thinking of renting it for only for 'eye candy' purposes. it won't satisfy even that.",0
powers booth is hypnotic as cult leader jim jones who led his peoples temple followers from 1953 until 1978 when he led them in a mass suicide in 1978 where over 900 died. a very well done movie which may seem a little dated due to the 70s time period but well worth the time 8 of 10,1
"oh what a condescending movie! set in los angeles, the center of the universe from the pov of hollywood filmmakers, this movie tries to be a deep social commentary on contemporary american angst.  stereotyped, smarmy characters of widely varying socio-economic backgrounds cross paths in their everyday, humdrum lives. the plot is disjointed and desultory. numerous unimaginative plot contrivances keep the film going, like: a drive-by shooting, an abandoned baby left in the weeds, a gang of thugs intimidating a lawyer, a guy flying through the night sky over the city, a kid at summer camp.  and through all these events, the one constant is the generous helping of sociological ""insights"" imparted through the dialogue, as characters compare notes on their life experiences. one character tells another: ""when you sit on the edge of that thing (the grand canyon), you realize what a joke we people are; ... those rocks are laughing at me, i could tell, me and my worries; it's real humorous to that grand canyon"".  and another character pontificates about the meaning of it all: ""there's a gulf in this country, an ever widening abyss between the people who have stuff and the people who don't have ... it's like this big hole has opened up in the ground, as big as the ... grand canyon, and what's come pouring out ... is an eruption of rage, and the rage creates violence ..."".  aside from the horribly unnatural and forced dialogue, aside from the shallow, smarmy characters, aside from the dumb plot, the story's pace is agonizingly slow. acting is uninspired and perfunctory. the film's tone is smug and self-satisfied, in the script's contempt for viewers.  this was a film project approved by hollywood suits who fancy themselves as omnipotent gurus, looking down from on high. they think their film will be a startling revelation to us lowly, unknowing movie goers, eager to learn about the real meaning of american social change.",0
"this is probably one of the worst movies ever made. bad acting, bad special effects, bad plot, bad everything. in the last 15 minutes a cat suited-cyborg is introduced which muddles everything. malcom macdowell must have needed to make a house payment because otherwise he would have had to sell himself on hollywood blvd to pay the bill. i just don""t know how you can go from clockwork orange to this crap and be able to look yourself in the mirror each morning. i could have done better special effects in my bathtub. there's no continuity. the editor must have been asleep or on drugs its so bad. acting. do they have to smoke to be bad.? the gun either shoots blue flames or bullets, make up your mind. the bad girl and the other girl in the movie look so much alike that it is confusing. whay is it called 2013 seadly wake. it has nothing to do with the movie",0
"i've watched this movie a second time to try to figure out why it wasn't as successful (commercially or artistically) as it should have been, and discovered considerable artistic merit--which may ultimately have been its commercial undoing.  first of all, this movie attempts ""serious"" science-fiction, social commentary, more than action-adventure. there is action in it, but that's not really what it's about. if you focus on that, you'll end up with (as others have noted) a bad ""aliens"" clone. but, again, that's not what it's about.  the movie is really about todd's (kurt russell) transformation from human to near-machine and back to human (mostly *back*). but because it's not trying to give you a typically glib hollywood style answer, kurt russell must make this transformation without speaking, and largely without broad expressions. and he really does a wonderful job--it can take two viewings to appreciate it.  the surrounding ""social logic"" is flawed and it's never adequately explained whether todd's ability to hold his own against an army of supposedly superior troops comes from his experience on the battlefield or his newfound human-ness or what, but the movie still makes a marvellous showcase for russell's (easy to underestimate) talent.",1
"this is a movie about animal cruelty. under the guise of a marathon race, we see depictions of extreme animal abuse, including literally running a horse to death in slow motion. the guy who did this then has his conscience spiritually cleansed by the flames from the burial/burning of the horse, which of course is still dead, having been tortured to death. this is one of the sickest, slimiest movies i've ever had the displeasure of viewing. as gene hackman and james coburn near the finish line on their dying animals, we're supposed to admire their spirit for finishing the race. i'd like to put the producers and director in a marathon race; i'll decide when they're finished, probably about 20 minutes after they stop breathing.",0
"i watched this movie with my mother when i was in high school many years ago. i definitely was not the least bit interested in opera at the time, but he changed my views. i enjoyed this movie very much and have truly enjoyed opera ever since. i even bought several of his cd's. who cares what his acting abilities were, he basically just played himself, which was adorable. he was so charming, so charismatic; i honestly just wanted to hug him. i feel very sad that so many are criticizing him so harshly. it was so straight, did not accept people pushing him around or judging him for his actions. he deserves to be respected and admired for his talent. he will definitely be missed!!!",1
"this movie has an all star cast, john candy, richard lewis, ornella mutti, cybill shepard, and jim belushi to name a few, run amuck in monte carlo, as well as some other beautiful european locations, and is very funny. the trouble that everyone gets in when they lie to protect themselves is great, and i highly recommend that you see this movie, it is well worth it! john candy is in top form in once upon a crime, as is everyone else! if you and your family are looking for a great family film, this is your ticket. everyone gives stellar performances, great acting, great comedy, and great timing, which is rare in movies these days. great plot, great mystery, (which i love anyways) and overall, well worth the money you spend on it. so get the kids, grab some popcorn, juice, or tea, or sodas, and enjoy the show!!!!",1
"i'd passed this title 15 or 20 times while in blockbuster, looking for something halfway decent to watch. all i can say is that they were all out halfway decent films the night i chose to rent this.  i will give it credit for being leaps and bounds better than ""dracula 3000"", but in actuality that's pretty easy to say since this one didn't have caper van dien in it. the other things it lacked in spades were: an interesting cast, interesting story, good dialog and originality, but i suppose you can't have everything.  ***spoilers ahead*** the misfit crew of vampire hunters (one of which was a vampire... go figure) flew around from mining colony to mining colony trying to wipe out all the vampires it could find. the crew consists of: the cocky, ne'er-do-well captain (who dies early on), his by-the-book, yet inexperienced first mate, the aforementioned vampire vampire hunter (not a typo), a wannabe cowboy and a really, really butch asian commando, ""tough guy"" female... it almost sounds like the cast for mtv's 'the real world'. after the captain dies in a violent confrontation with a mob of bloodsuckers (and as it turns out, lovers of the finer parts of human anatomy) his first mate takes over... blah, blah, blah... everyone hates him... blah, blah, blah... i could go on, but as i said it's the same storyline used in about a hundred other 'films' of the genre.  the effects were cheese and why michael ironside was in this movie is beyond me. the vampire vampire hunter (still not a typo) was pretty hot, but of course if you're waiting for her to expose more than just her cleavage, look elsewhere.  i can't say that it was the worst film i've seen, as i actually rented 'starship troopers 2', but wait for this one to come on the sci-fi channel.",0
"this motion picture comes straight out of the dark dungeon of full moon entertainment. this production company gained fame and fortune during the first half of the 90's by producing terribly bad and cheesy horror movies. the most famous disasters in their ouvre are ""subspecies"", ""seedpeople"" and ""trancers"". none of these are recommended and neither is doctor mordrid, actually. hyperactive director charles band did come to the right company for his film. doctor mordrid is amazingly dumb and cheesy and almost completely humourless. i only saw it because it stars jeffrey combs. i learned that it can have several disadvantages if you're a fan of him. for every good movie, it seems like he has made 5 inferior ones. anyways, the story is about the battle between 2 ancient sorcerers. one good one who's here since 150 years to protect the humans ( jeffrey as dr.mordrid ) and one wicked one called kabal. he wants to destroy every form of human life for some reason i already forgot. combs gets his instructions from mentor. that ""guy"" only exists of a pair of eyes in space. very very cheesy, that is ! every once and a while a blinding lightflash is shown on the screen but that's about the only form of special effects this movie has got. the whole thing is just a piece of whining and nagging and when the two wizards finally face each other, it's over before you know it...i would have expected for the wicked wizard to at least fight back a little, but nooooooo.... in some scenes, you really can detect some originality and creativity ( like for example jeffrey's lecture about the influence of the moon on criminals ) and if you really pay attention, you might even find some very small but nice aspects ( like the raven which is called edgar allen) but overall, it's a terrible waste of time and energy. i'm a big fan of jeffrey and maybe he is a superhero in my eyes...but he sure doesn't have to put on a stupid maillot for that.",0
"a mess of genres but it's mainly based on stephen chow's genre mash-ups for it's inspiration. there's magic kung-fu, college romance, sports, gangster action and some weepy melodrama for a topping. the production is excellent and the pacing is fast so it's easy to get past the many flaws in this film.  a baby is abandoned next to a basketball court. a homeless man brings him to a shaolin monastery that's in the middle of a city along with a special kung fu manual that the homeless man somehow has but can't read. the old monk teaches the boy but expires when he tries to master the special technique in the manual. the school is taken over by a phony kung fu master who is assisted by four wacky monks. the new master gets mad at the now 20+ year old boy for not pretending to be hurt by the master's weak punches and throws him out for the night. the boy is found throwing garbage into a basket from an incredible distance by a man who bring him to a gangster's club to play darts. this leads to a big fight, the boy's expulsion from the monastery and the man's decision to turn the boy into a college basketball sensation.  al this happens in the first 20 minutes with most of it happening in the first 10 minutes. aside from the extreme shorthand storytelling the first problem is how little we get to know the main character until way into the movie. the man who uses the boy is more sharply defined by the time the first third is over. the plot follows no new ground except for the insane action climax of the film. i'm sure you can easily imagine how the wacky monks will show up towards the end. the effects, photography and stunt work are all top- notch and make up for the uninspired plot.   stephen chow has a much better command of plot and comedy writing and this film will live in his shadow but that's not a good reason to ignore it. it's quite entertaining even with a scatter-shot ending. recommended.",1
"this title seems more like a filming exercise than a film that should have been released to be seen by the public. for dafoe and his wife it must have been fun working together in a film for the first time, without taking into consideration that people might actually watch it. i felt like it was 90mins wasted as i waited anxiously for a plot to develop, or even begin.  try to fit this film into a genre and you won't, because it lacks a beginning, middle or ending. i've seen 'arty' movies before and this doesn't even come close to being arty, abstract or original, it just seems to me to be completely pointless.  i think it speaks for itself when the only persons that rated this film a 10 were the under 18 age group. no doubt for the constant pointless erotic scenes that the film was insistent on throwing at us. that is if you can call it erotic. it certainly didn't have taste.",0

"this movie has a special way of telling the story, at first i found it rather odd as it jumped through time and i had no idea whats happening.  anyway the story line was although simple, but still very real and touching. you met someone the first time, you fell in love completely, but broke up at last and promoted a deadly agony. who hasn't go through this? but we will never forget this kind of pain in our life.   i would say i am rather touched as two actor has shown great performance in showing the love between the characters. i just wish that the story could be a happy ending.",1
"war inc. is a funny but strange film. the actors are likable, the film is likable also, but i don't know how to describe the plot. i will go into the plot later on. this is a movie with some weird casting choices. besides john cusack as a hit-man, which we saw years ago in grosse point blank which i liked.   here we have hilary duff playing a russian pop star named yonica babyya or something like that. her character is odd. there is a scene where she sticks a scorpion down her pants. and hits on hauser(cusack). there is a twist in the end involving the two characters. it makes sense.  that is the only casting choice i am going into. cause it just plain strange. the whole movie is strange. but at times incredibly funny and i was never bored. here we have some of the best actors out there. excluding miss duff. she ain't great. but here we have john cusack, marisa tomeii, joan cusack, ben kingsley. see what i mean?  this is the story of a hit-man named hauser(cusack). he is sent down to some middle eastern city to put a hit on an oil man named omar sheriif(not the actor). while trying to deal with his own personal problems, he has to help out the wedding of a popstar(played by hilary duff). and he falls in love with a news reporter(played by marisa tomeii). there is a thing about the popstar though. hauser is disgusted by her. there is a scene where she is singing a song to him and afterwards he throws up.  the twist in the end of the film reveals kind of why. the thing about the twist is that i did kind of see it coming. but that doesn't matter. this is a strange, funny, and entertaining comedy. i love most of the actors. so really, how could i not recommend it?  war,inc.:3.5/5",1
"... hawk heaven for lovers of french cinema and by extension french screen actors/actresses. at its worst it's an indulgence, actors getting to bitch about other actors, question the validity of acting as a profession at all, etc whilst at its best it's a glorious celebration/send-up of some of the finest actors currently working. from a simple premise - jean-pierre marielle's request for water being ignored in a restaurant - blier spins off in all directions and allows the cream of french cinema to strut their stuff before the camera even throwing in nods to those no longer around (jean gabin, lino ventura) including the director's father, bernard, one of the great stalwarts of french cinema, from whom he fields a celestial phone call at the end of the film. discursive and prolix, yes, guilty as charged but also something of a guilty pleasure.",1
"reading through all these positive reviews i find myself baffled. how is it that so many enjoyed what i consider to be a woefully bad adaptation of my second favourite jane austen novel? there are many problems with the film, already mentioned in a few reviews; simply put it is a hammed-up, over-acted, chintzy mess from opening credits to butchered ending.  while many characters are mis-cast and neither ewan mcgregor nor toni collette puts in a performance that is worthy of them, the worst by far is paltrow. i have very much enjoyed her performance in some roles, but here she is abominable - she is self-conscious, nasal, slouching and entirely disconnected from her characters and those around her. an extremely disappointing effort - though even a perfect emma could not have saved this film.",0
"joan fontaine is ""a damsel in distress"" in this 1937 musical starring fred astaire, george burns, and gracie allen. the plot, what there is of it, is about a british woman (fontaine) in love with an american, who is mistaken for astaire, a musical comedy star.  the film, directed by george stevens, contains some wonderful gershwin music, including ""nice work if you can get it"" and ""a foggy day."" the best scene is the ""stiff upper lip"" number, which takes place in a fun house.  astaire's singing voice sounds more robust in this film than it does in others, and he has a couple of excellent dance numbers. burns plays his over the top publicist and allen is burns' secretary. she's hilarious. the problem, as others have pointed out, is fontaine, who has to dance with astaire at the end of the film. stevens could easily have used a double because he shows the dance in a long shot, and it takes place among the trees. i would have thought it was a double except the dancing was so lousy.  definitely worth seeing despite its flaws.",1

"this film deserves another bad review. consider one reviewer extolling the film's virtues that include 'no sex, violence or gore.' uh, excuse me. the very set-up of the film has us watching as cody's young comrade, with love of life and who has everything to live for is blown to bits leaving cody holding his lifeless, bloody body. and, given the nature of war we know that cody has seen horror on almost a daily basis. so much for those viewing this film with such rose glasses that the violence which defines cody's persona is erased from viewer memory.  sans any family of his own cody, like john rambo, roams the country on his bike making the long trek to hometown usa in the guise of some place called nevada city. no mention, no realization of the clear fact that cody is damaged goods. we know this since his co practically declares him so as he order cody to 'get some rest' away from the death and destruction of war. this explains, as none seem to notice or care, cody's obvious 'flat' effect. it is not bad acting. it is the flat effect of post traumatic stress disorder. not guessing here, remember his co ordered him off the battle field.  how about that 'accidental' kiss as noted by another review. the fall was an accident, the kiss was not. how exactly was cody 'respecting' faith by hitting on her knowing full well she was spoken for? now that was a non-family value moment. a moment which is then announced to the immediate universe as if posted on youtube. of course faith's lapse of fidelity as well as cody's 'coming on' to a woman who plans to marry another is received in the spirit of the xmas season, all cheering their cheaten' hearts and lips.  we know little about faith's fiancé except that she professes her love for him, she takes no longer than a nano second to accept his proposal (could have waited if any second thoughts), he is generous, he loves her to death, the family has nothing really against him, he believes marriage is based on compromises and the two have never discussed post marriage plans. no evil doers here.  asner is a fine actor given over the hill dialogue like 'we love you son....' 'you are part of our family' literally days after they have met a stranger named cody. and the 'band of brothers' speech where the phrase was above all never intended to apply to virtual strangers off the battle field.  bottom line: this film is cotton candy xmas fluff that betrays itself in major ways. most grossly when it applauds cody's disrespect for faith by physically hitting on her knowing full well she is spoken for. by re-defining family as we know it to wit: accepting a virtual stranger as a full fledged loving member of the family because we all 'love you.' how many of you have done that or know anyone who has done that. not.",0
i loved this excellent movie. farrah fawcett played the part phenomenally and with good heart. she plays a woman who is driven to extreme measures to protect herself and her friends after she is attacked by a stranger. after being rejected by the police she realizes she is on her own.  then one day when she at home alone the stranger breaks into her home and attacks her again. not being about to call the police or get him out she is forced to spray him in the eyes and imprisons him in her fireplace.  i think there is a need for a wake up call to the laws of the land. they are too easy on these criminals. it's time for more harsh punishments.,1
"as this movie is completely in swiss dialect, it's probably hard for most german speakers to really follow this movie. i'm not from switzerland, but i worked there for some years, so i had the chance to understand this great spoof of the lord of the rings. i've seen a lot of movies of this kind (eg. scary movie, loads of scifi spoofs etc.) but this one is the best one of that kind, i've seen so far. i give a 9 of 10. the only reason i can't give a 10 is, because there are some little details which could have been done better and because they supplied no subtitles in any language on the dvd, so there's almost no chance for non-swiss to understand.",1

"""igor and the lunatics"" is a totally inept and amateurish attempt at a crazy-hippie-cult-killing-spree horror movie. apparently even nearly twenty years later, charles manson was still inspiring overenthusiastic but incompetent trash-filmmakers. this is a typical troma production, meaning in other words, there's a lot of boring and totally irrelevant padding footage to accompany the nonsensical plot. there's a bit of random gore and gratuitous nudity on display  which isn't bad  but it's all so very pointless and ugly that it becomes frustrating to look at. ""igor and the lunatics"" is so desperate that it's even using a lot of the footage twice, like the circle saw killing for example. the incoherent plot tries to tell the story of a hippie cult run by the drug-addicted and charlie manson wannabe paul. one of paul's lower ranked disciples, named igor, becomes a little bit too obsessed with the bible stories and drug orgies and gradually causes the entire cult to descent further into criminal insanity. just to illustrate through a little example exactly how crazy igor is: he tears the heart straight out of the chest of a really sexy black hitch-hiker girl! there's an annoying synthesizer soundtrack and some truly embarrassingly lame pseudo-artistic camera tricks, like slow-motion footage and lurid dream sequences. maybe there's one sequence that more or less qualifies as worthwhile for trash fanatics and that' is when a poor girl is cut in half with a machete. for no particular reason, the camera holds the shot of the blade in the bloodied stomach for fifteen whole seconds.",0

"there was nothing of value in the original movie, this one was even lamer. the fact that i even found it to rent was absolutely amazing. anyone connected to this film has to be high on something! so what was the story line? what was with the girl? was the viewer supposed to get the story line in the first four minutes of the film. sadly, i tried several times to watch this. i even borrowed a kid from someone to get some feedback. kid said it was stupid, and he was four years old. i find that possibly some credit could go to the filming director, as possibly some of the shots made the movie more than a b film. that might be pushing it. i did love the theme song. good thing it was only a dollar, it was worth it. i suppose you might enjoy the film if you were high as the cast and crew would have to be. is pot legal in france?",0
"""addictive"" is an adjective i've heard many times when talking of certain tv shows. most recently, dramas like lost, heroes and prison break have earned that description. however, as compelling as they may be (and they really are) i can wait a few days before i see the next episode of either series, even prison break which some have lazily classified as ""the new 24"". with all due respect, there can be no such thing, and for a good reason: no other silver-screen thriller is based on a real-time structure. that's what sets 24 apart from any other show, and that's why i practically have to watch an entire season (on dvd) in seven days or less: once the frickin' clock starts ticking, it's impossible to tune out.  an episode whose events unfolded over the course of a single day was a trademark of nypd blue (and, more recently, deadwood); having an entire season of a new series last 24 hours, one per ep (the actual running time is 41 minutes; the remaining 19 are occupied by commercials when the show airs on telly), was the most groundbreaking idea in mainstream television since hill street blues introduced non-linear storytelling (a mandatory element nowadays). and it truly paid off.  ironically enough, the original plan for the series was to make it revolve around a wedding (fortunately, creators joel surnow and robert cochran realized the format was more suitable for a conspiracy thriller), which is probably the reason the first glimpse we get of the hero suggests a cheerful atmosphere: looking extremely relaxed, jack bauer (kiefer sutherland) is enjoying a game of chess with his daughter kimberly (elisha cuthbert) and, minutes later, being tender with teri (leslie hope), the wife with whom he has just reconciled. as in the sopranos, though, something unexpected and shocking is just behind the corner: not only has kim snuck out of her room, jack also receives a phone call urging him to get to work immediately. at midnight? i'm afraid so: bauer is a ctu (counter terrorist unit) agent, and his boss has acquired reliable intel about a possible hit on the life of david palmer (dennis haysbert), an african-american presidential candidate who will be in los angeles for the whole day (oh, right, i almost forgot: events occur on the day of the california presidential primary). no time for napping, then: jack has to spend the next 24 hours working on the case. unfortunately, he has a tendency to ignore protocol, and that doesn't sit well with george mason (xander berkeley), a slimy man from division who has been asked to interfere with the operation.  the plot is very dense, making the show hard to recommend for those with a short attention span, but anyone willing to take a look will be rewarded instantly: the writing is sharp and precise, the attention to detail unsurpassed, and the suspense is consistently sky-high, mainly thanks to the real-time trickery which considerably enhances the adrenaline level.  another great quality of this pilot is the characterization: most genre shows (sci-fi and thriller) tend to simply introduce the key players and then define them later on (a textbook example is csi, where character development is minimal, but then again that matches the show's unique style), whereas the series debut of 24 offers a rich array of fully rounded people, among whom jack (sutherland's best role - ever!) and palmer (the real revelation of the show) stand out for being perfectly described after one episode only (the former divided between job and family, reckless but humane, the latter honorable and endowed with great integrity). a couple of supporting parts border on stereotype (mason and tony almeida especially), but two factors ought to be taken into account: a) this is the first episode; b) there's so much going on most viewers won't even complain about a ""flaw"" or two. after all, how many network programs manage to begin with a conspiracy, a missing teenager and a huge explosion - and still have equally satisfying material for the rest of the season?  tick, tock, tick, tock...",1
"i am not from america and i know what 'wife swap' is. when a show came out of that name i was thrilled to see some cool glamorized sexual moments from the program. but what i got was a real sucking stupidity. i was misjudged by its title name, it has no adult contents, no nudity, not even vulgar dialogues (broad casted threw hallmark channel and i think they edited/mute out such contents to make it neat).  a show which gives a picture of current american/western family state, overweight chubby peoples, polluted teenagers, and their sucking family goings. in each episode two wives/two mothers (more correctly) were chosen to live in each others home and re-changes each others family routine with their new own rule. sometimes its turns out to be good or more evenly bad. on the ending section each mothers are brought back with their husband and try to conclude what they did to each families past days. it's the sucking portion of the program were each contenders fights for their rights. i was sucked to see all of these instead of seeing some cool adult sex stuff. i mean who make this program, more than that who gave the name ""wife swap""; its better to be called as ""mother swap"". all in all it corrupts all the great things the real wife swap stands for!   wife swap = average sucking reality show.",0
"this was the worst film i have seen for a long time.   not only that it has nearly nothing to do with the other american pie movies, the story is obvious, flat and absolutely not funny.   the girls are nice though, but spending your time watching a cheap soft porno would possibly be greater than watching this film.  this film seems to be a very bad made sex ad, made for an audience that is not older than 12.  i never visited an american college, but i would seriously doubt that anyone who did could really laugh about any of the scenes.  save your time, do something else.",0
"my first opinions on this movie were of course bad.i was expecting a horrible, crappy acting, bad entertainment, ridiculous special effects movie.what i got was actually not that bad.the special effects were absolutely horrible, but i found the movie itself quite interesting, and the script was actually pretty good and decent.the acting wasn't that bad, and overall i had fun watching this movie.it's still a pretty bad film, but it's not completely worthless like i thought it was going to be, and i'm pleased to know that this movie managed to wow me, even when it wasn't that good.overall, it's a film that should be avoided, but to me it wasn't as bad as i was expecting it to be.",0
"i'm not going to say that this movie is horrible, because i have seen worse, but it's not even halfway decent.   the plot is very confusing. i couldn't really figure out what was happening and where things were going. when the movie was over, i was left scratching my head. i watched through to the end of the credits to see if they had something after them that may clear things up, but once the credits were over, that was it. i felt like i was jarred from one weak plot point to another throughout the whole movie, with little or no transition between the two.   character development is very shallow. i couldn't figure out when somebody was angry or had a grudge against someone. i couldn't tell if half of the characters were just supposed to be drunk, stoned, mentally challenged or they just had a bad actor to portray them. this film seems to be based around stereotypes (to it's credit, they are hard to avoid using when you are making a film about a singer in a rock band), which should make character development easier, since so many other films have already illustrated the suffering of an abused child, or the trials of a heroin addict trying to come clean. stereotypes are easy to depict, which would explain why so many bad films tend to overuse stereotypical characters. this film, on the other hand, uses stereotypical characters left and right, but then tries to keep them as incomprehensible as possible.  another problem with the characters is that they seemed to be dismissed with no explanation. i guess that's ok because so little time was spent developing the characters that i really didn't get a chance to know any of them, so i never really missed any of them.  and last but not least was sadie's singing. it's awful. the music backing her up is not prize winner, but it is usually drowned out by the screeches that are released from sadie's vocal cords. i swear that there's one point in the movie where she sings a song for at least 10 minutes. i seriously thought i was going to have to turn it off during this howl-a-thon.  as a whole, this movie is confusing. characters are ill-developed, georgia's acting is wooden and stiff, sadie's character is yanked from one bad situation to another, with no back story or explanation. the music was unbearable, and i can think of no good reasons to see this film unless you have a thirst for cinematic pain.",0
"this movie looked good - good cast, evergreen topic and an explosive opening. it went downhill from there. why was it filmed by hand held camera? it shakes, judders, part captures scenes and simply confuses the viewer. a poor choice indeed. as if this was not enough, the worst edit in memory assumes a drugged viewer - mandatory if you want to get any enjoyment from it at all. and then it commits the worst sin of all. after leading the viewer down all sorts of unlikely and implausible scenarios to the point of exhaustion, they roll credits without revealing the denouement - the ending - the payoff -like what the heck was the motive? how can you expect to succeed by making thrillers without an ending? doh! this movie had great promise and ending up doing a face plant in the mud. what a waste of effort. poor effort by writer and director.",0
"notable because of it's notorious explicit scene when the gorgeous maruschka detmers takes her young lover's penis from his trousers and into her mouth. even without this moment the film is a splendid if slightly disturbing passionate and blindingly sexy ride. detmers puts in a great performance as the partly deranged, insatiable delight, wandering about her flat nude. dressed, partly dressed and naked she steals most of the film about love, sexual passion, philosophy and politics. for me the last two get a little lost and the ending is most confusing when her fiancé is released whilst fellow terrorists are released, she seems uncertain as to who she wants and the young lover seems more interested in his exams than anything else as she weeps, beautifully of course!",1
"i suggested renting this movie to my friend and he obliged since he had already seen the film and he said it was okay. i thought the title was a bit campy since the version at our store was called ""the fear:halloween night"". i expected this movie to be somewhat of a halloween rip off with a killer wooden guy. but it opened with a good scene and the killer murdered two victims immediately and flashed forward twenty years later where his son who had witnessed him kill the two people(including his mother) and he even witnessed his fathers suicide is going to a secluded cabin in the woods with his friends and his girlfriend where he attempts to face his fears until a wooden statue comes to life with his fathers spirit. pretty good for a sequel and i never even seen the first.",1
"oh my goodness. this was a real big mess that just couldn't help itself. jeffrey (jon heder) is a 29 year old man still living with his mum (diane keaton) and not planning on going anywhere. until his mother meets a rich businessman named mert (jeff daniels) who she may be getting married to.  it would have been an ok movie if heder didn't play his jeffrey so annoying, from the very start there is no chance of liking him and it only gets worse and worse. in the end, we are supposed to like him, but there was no reason to as he hadn't changed from the selfish brute that he was at the beginning of the movie.  keaton doesn't look to even be trying and is in horrible form after 2007's because i said so. not to mention the shocking chemistry between heder and keaton, and where supposed to believe that their mother and son? the only saving grace is jeff daniels and anna faris although they don't look very interested either. apart from a few little smiles, this film really doesn't deserve to be called a comedy simply because there is barely anything to laugh at! if your in the mood for a recent diane keaton flick watch mad money or smother which are a lot better than this abysmal effort.",0
"when watching this show you are not quite sure whether it is the story or the acting that is more annoying. first of all, the storyline of each episode is very predictable, the writers must have used every cliché possible, you can guess not only the general plot, but the arrangement of the scenes and also the lines of each character, making the show some sort of a collage of every police series out there. on the top of it all comes the ""message"" of the show, that the good are good and the bad are bad and that at the end of the day the good shall prevail and that we should all love each other, be better man and better citizens, all done in the most ostensible manner. the actors, as the vehicles of this message and nothing more than that, will use a limited set of acting skills: the ""i am a good carrying person"" smile, the concerned look and the ""victory is ours"" body posture, while the bad guys have the ""i'm a bad one"" frowning and the ""you caught me"" look, followed by the ""i'm good for nothing and i should be removed from society"" head banding (this kind of also sums up the general development of each show). true story or not, the show is garbage, yet another proof that producers don't give a s**t about viewers, that we are all thought to be idiots. well this series makes every possible attempt to idiotize the living brains out of you.",0
"i work at a blockbuster store and every week we have movies that come in with just a few copies, these are the kind of movies that the sci-fi channel shows. the kind of movie that nobody ever wants, and only that idiots rent, when they bring it back i ask them ""was it any good?"", they say ""no we turned it off after 15 minutes!"" movies with terrible computer generated, super imposed monsters and such like, very unappealing.  this is the same type of movie that grendel is, and absolute waste of time, if you want a reasonably (and only reasonably) good beowulf based movie then try beowulf & grendel , starring gerard butler, who is also starring in the eagerly anticipated 300, as king leonidas of sparta.  plus, later this year we have another beowulf movie, with a star studded cast ranging from anthony hopkins and brendan gleeson, to angelina jolie and john malkovich.  but don't let that get your hopes up like we all did with eragon, or we are all in for another big disappointment.  and regarding rentals, here is my rule of thumb: if there is only one or two copies, don't rent it because its a load of crap.( this is true 99.9% of the time, usually not true if the title is foreign, or a documentary.)",0

"i just don't see how a concorde-new horizons film directed by jim wynorski and featuring the acting talents of andrew stevens and a puppet could be bad. it just boggles the mind, doesn't it?  well, let's make no mistake about it. ""munchie strikes back"" is indeed a bad film. munchie is a puppet who has been around for many centuries. for reasons not fully explained until the end of the film, he is sent to earth to help a single mother and her son. the mom's problem (her main problem at least) is that she has a balloon payment due on her mortgage in two weeks...to the not-so-tiny tune of $20,000. ouch. she can't come up with the money because she just got fired. ok...just is the key word in that sentence. what the...? was she planning on paying it off with a single paycheck? maybe it would've been a good idea to have spent the last several years saving up for it...ya think?  munchie has magical powers similar to those a genie would possess...but there isn't a limit on the number of wishes you can make! munchie gets the boy a bunch of fancy stuff for one night but then the kid asks for it to be sent back to the mall munchie was ""borrowing"" it from. the annoying furball also uses his otherworldly skills to help the boy win a baseball game by means of cheating. a baseball is hit so hard that it orbits the earth several times. sadly, those dumb parents watching the game don't think it's at all strange. hmm.  anyway, i'd like to wrap this up because this has already drained away enough of my lifeforce as it is. you'll be truly moved by the scene where leslie-anne down, playing the mother, kicks a dog which is yapping at her. your heart will melt at her charm when she notices dollar bills fluttering down on her front yard and she wonders how it could be snowing during the summer. ""munchie strikes back""'s credits promised another film to follow entitled, i believe, ""munchie hangs ten"". to date, the movie viewing public has been robbed of what would surely have been a cinematic tour de force. heh. 1/10",0

"i am the guy who usually keeps opinions to himself, but i just got back from this movie, and felt i had to express my opinions. let me start by saying that i am a huge horror fan. but what makes a horror movie? i sure like to see even a tiny bit of a good script and character development. i know they often lack in horror movies, but prom night looked like it didn't even put forth any effort in that department. next, we all love suspense. that on the edge of your seat suspense with unpredictable surprises. yeah, prom night had none of that! of course, we like a terrifying killer. prom night have that? nope, it has a pretty boy with a cute lil' knife. and when all else fails...at least horror has its guilty pleasure to make it enjoyable like gore gore gore, and the occasional nude scene! yeah, well when you have a horror movie rated pg-13 like prom night, they leave that stuff out too. so with all of these elements missing, i ask....does this still count as a horror movie? nope. i'd call it more of a comedy. people in my theater were laughing more at this then they were when i saw ""semi-pro"" that was supposed to actually be a comedy (which also sucked, but thats another story!). i think i am just going to have to give up on new horror. all the good horror movies of the good ol' days have been remade into garbage so movie studios can make money. the people i went to see it with didn't even know this was a remake! which made me mad! i wonder what will happen when there's no more movies to remake??? where will horror go next???",0
"frankie dio (lee vancleef) is a high-ranking mobster who turns himself in to the police or illegal gambling (for reasons that seem unclear to me). tony (tony lo bianco) is a low-level thug who frequents a pool hall and spends his free time envying frankie. by being in the right place at the right time, tony gets arrested with frankie and is sent to jail... where they form a bond that may not quite be friendship, but it will do for now.  this film came to me under the title of ""frank and tony"", which is disappointing because i see an alternate name is ""mean frank and crazy tony"", which would have helped sell the film more effectively. i presume that's an homage to ""dirty mary, crazy larry"" but what do i know? i watched it shortly after another italian crime film, ""violent professionals"", and i must say the two complement each other very well.  italians have always lagged behind americans in their budgets and production values, which is a real shame with this film. it is considered a ""grindhouse"" film, which unfairly demotes it to a b-movie (or worse). with a cleaner sound and picture, this could have been a hollywood hit, i suspect. i found the story very interesting, the characters (and actors) better than average and unlike ""violent professionals"" the plot is fairly clear -- not too many secondary characters.  if you like mafia movies or crime films you should give this one a try. a film about the mob that's actually from italy (how much more authentic do you want?) is as much as you can ask. sure, it's not ""the godfather"", but it's not supposed to be. this isn't a drama, it's a light comedy, heavy action buddy film... like ""die hard with a vengeance"" from the point of view of the bad guys. well, okay, not really.  if nothing else, this film made me want to check out other films from the director and the principle cast. films besides ""escape from new york"" (where vancleef plays ""hauk"") and the usual cult movies. what's more fun than discovering a lost classic?",1
"i am always wary of taking too instant a dislike to a film. look at it a month later and you might see it differently, or dig it up after 50 years in a different continent and some cult followers find something stylistically remarkable that went unnoticed at first. after sitting through the great ecstasy of robert carmichael at its uk premiere, it came as no surprise to me that i found the question and answer session afterwards more interesting than the film itself. shane danielsen (artistic director of the edinburgh international film festival), aided by the film's director and producer, gave a spirited defence of a movie than received an overall negative response from the audience. edinburgh festival audiences are not easily shocked. only one person walked out in disgust. the criticisms of the film included very articulate and constructive ones from the lay public as well as an actor and a woman who teaches m.a. film directors. this was not an overly 'shocking' film. there was a degree of uninterrupted sexual violence, but far less extreme than many movies (most actual weapon contact was obscured, as were aroused genitals). the audience disliked it because they had sat through two hours that were quite boring, where the acting standards were not high, where the plot was poor, predictable and drawn out, and where they had been subjected to clumsy and pretentious film-making on the promise of a controversial movie. metaphors to the war in iraq are contrived, over-emphasised and sloppy (apart from a general allusion to violence, any deeper meaning is unclear); and the 'fig-leaf' reference marquis de sade, as one audience member put it, seems a mere tokenistic excuse for lack of plot development towards the finale.  we have the story of an adolescent who has a certain amount going for him (he stands out at school for his musical ability) but takes drugs and hangs out with youths who have little or nothing going for them and whose criminal activities extend to rape and violence. when pushed, robert seems to have a lot of violence locked inside him.  the film is not entirely without merit. the audience is left to decide how robert got that way: was it the influence of his peers? why did all the good influences and concern from parents and teachers not manage to include him in a better approach to life? cinematically, there is a carefully-montaged scene where he hangs back (whether through too much drugs, shyness, a latent sense of morality or just waiting his turn?). several of his friends are raping a woman in a back room, partly glimpsed and framed in the centre of the screen. in the foreground of the bare bones flat, a dj is more concerned that the girl's screams interrupt his happy house music than with any thought for the woman. ultimately he is a bit annoyed if their activities attract police attention. the stark juxtaposition of serious headphones enjoyment of his music even when he knows a rape is going on points up his utter disdain in a deeply unsettling way. robert slumps with his back to us in the foreground.  but the rest of the film, including its supposedly controversial climax involving considerable (if not overly realistic) sexual violence, is not up to this standard. some people have had a strong reaction to it (the filmmakers' stated intention: ""if they vomit, we have succeeded in producing a reaction"") but mostly - and as far as i can tell the edinburgh reaction seems to mirror reports from cannes - they feel, ""why have programmers subjected us to such inferior quality film-making?"" director clay hugh can talk the talk but has not developed artistic vision. his replies about holding up a mirror to life to tell the truth about things that are swept under the carpet, even his defence that there is little plot development because he didn't want to do a standard hollywood movie - all are good answers to criticisms, but unfortunately they do not apply to his film, any more than they do to holding up a mirror while someone defecates, or wastes film while playing ineptly with symbols. wanting to try and give him the benefit of any lingering doubt, i spoke to him for a few minutes after the screening, but i found him as distasteful as his movie and soon moved to the bar to wash my mouth out with something more substantial. there are many truths. one aspect of art is to educate, another to entertain, another to inspire. i had asked him if he had any social or political agenda and he mentions ken loach (one of the many great names he takes in vain) without going so far as to admit any agenda himself. he then falls back on his mantra about his job being to tell the truth. i am left with the feeling that this was an overambitious project for a new director, or else a disingenuous attempt to put himself on the map by courting publicity for second rate work  andy warhol could paint a tin of soup and it was art. clay hugh would like to emulate the great directors that have made controversial cinema and pushed boundaries. sadly, his ability at the moment only extends to making high-sounding excuses for a publicity-seeking film.",0
"!!!!! possible spoiler !!!!!  you`d think a story involving archie grey owl - an englishman posing as a red indian - would have a massive amount of humour involved . in fact i`d say the only way to treat a film like this where a remarkable man cons the gullible public is to treat it as a comedy . however richard attenborough commits something akin to a crime by making grey owl a serious drama . worse , he`s made an extremely dire film too . pierce brosnan lacks the charisma needed for the title role and the romantic subplot between grey owl and pony ( played by the equally wooden annie gaupeau ) lacks any type of on screen chemistry . but to be fair to the cast their not helped with the script which fails to portray archie as the cheeky chappy he is of fooling everyone into believing he`s a native american . the producers and screenwriter have made the major error of having the film centre around the plot twist of archie being an englishman - that`s why i wrote "" possible spoiler "" it`s not actually revealed untill late in the film that the title character is english , but it`s obvious that everyone who viewed this movie knew that beforehand hence there`s absolutely no surprise involved.  yes i do agree with everyone that the scenery is lovely and that it has a deep ecological message which isn`t actually a new concept . theodore roosevelt was the first important environmentalist of the 20th century if truth be told . and it should also be remembered that with the exception of soylent green ( and possibly the two towers if you want to class it as having a green message ) that there hasn`t actually been a great ecological film . in fact most environmentally concious films suck and that includes grey owl , a film that unsurprisingly had a serious problem in finding a distributor",0

(it does show in the final scene with nancy [ avoiding spoiler - everyone has to see oliver! for the first time sometime ].) how many lines do i need to type.  encouraging people to type too much is not to be encouraged.  i hope this counts as the ""10th line"".",1
a bit slow (somehow like a sofia coppola movie) but still a very captivating film about the discovery of sexuality by three teenage girls. the magic of the movie lies in its capacity to bring back many memories to how it felt like to be their age. the confusion and the insecurities are portrayed in a very simple way but so true to life. the music is perfect and the acting is amazing. the camera works beautifully also. i highly recommend it for those who are not afraid to look back at this particular period of life when we discover our sexual impulses and our desires. i would also say that it is a fine film for young people going through that period. so many movies have been made about adolescence but this really captures the true essence of discovering the adult world of romance and its complexities.,1
"there are some really terrific ideas in this violent movie that, if executed clearly, could have elevated it from spaghetti-western blandness into something special. unfortunately, a town called hell is one of the worst edited movies imaginable! scenes start and end abruptly, characters leave for long stretches, the performances (and accents) of the actors are pretty inconsistent, etc.  robert shaw is a mexican(!) revolutionary who, after taking part in wiping out a village, stays on to become a priest(!)...ten years later the village is being run by ""mayor"" telly salavas. stella stevens arrives looking for revenge on the man who killed her husband. colonel martin landau arrives looking for shaw. they all yell at each other a lot and they all shoot each other a lot. fernando rey is in it too (as a blind man). the performances aren't bad, but they are mightily uneven. savalas has an accent sometimes as does landau (who is really grating here). shaw and rey prove that they are incapable of really embarrassing themselves and stevens looks pretty foxy (if a bit out of place amongst the sweaty filth).",0

"if you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating. but you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyone,  just people with a sense of humor.  for those people the movie is great! it plays on old science fiction movies and radio shows long gone, most of witch where b-rated themselves. along the lines of spaceballs and airplane 2, you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes, but it is well worth it.",1
"the comparison to sleuth, the earlier stage-play-turned-film, is obvious and upon my first viewing i too thought sleuth was better, but deathtrap has, at least for me, many more repeat viewings in it than sleuth.  i purchased deathrap in the bargain bin at wal-mart, figuring that it had caine and the underrated reeve and was worth the 6 bucks. it was one of the finest dvd purchases i could've picked up.  it's one of those best-kept-secrets that movie buffs always are always delighted to discover. and it's totally worth repeat viewings.  though laurence olivier and michael caine turned in bravado performances in sleuth, i was doubly impressed with christopher reeve as clifford anderson. reeve, rightfully associated with his now legendary portrayal of superman, stole the show in what should've been an oscar worthy performance. i've always felt reeve was a type-cast actor who didn't get much of a chance to shine outside of the superman films and a few other flawed but entertaining films like somewhere in time, but this film shows that his potential was truly tapped and put to use, thank goodness.  i absolutely relished michael caine's performance. he was glib, deliciously manipulative and sadistic. and watching him work with reeve and dyan cannon was an absolute pleasure. in fact, it was thanks to this movie that i got into a ""michael caine phase"" and started renting as much of his stuff as humanly possible.   as for deathtrap, there's enough juicy dialogue in here to fill up its ""memorable quotes"" section. (unfortunately, much of the dialogue would inherently spoil the immensely entertaining plot).  it's really, really hard to talk about the movie without spoiling important plot points that are infinitely more fun to discover on your own. needless to say, it's a must-see. but for me, it was the greatest and most rewarding blind purchase of all time.  repeat viewings are a must.   and it deserves to sit alongside sleuth on your dvd shelf.  i'll leave you with this beautifully written quote from the film: ""i wonder if it wouldn't be...well...just a trifle starry-eyed of me to enter into such a risky and exciting collaboration...where i could count on no sense of moral obligation...whatsoever.""",1
"typically, ""kids"" films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13. but then again, that's before holes hit the scene. sure, it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality, but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions. the acting was decent, and the uneasy dynamics that stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray. what i especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didn't try to break your heart or make you cry. the emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine, kind of like the shawshank redemption in many ways (which holes also has a similar, redemptive ending to it). the only down side? the hokey looking lizards. overall, however, an 8/10.",1
"this film is a jolt of punk rock fun, from start to finish. the ramones, reigning princes of late-70s punk rock, appear as themselves. pj soles stars as riff randle, the rebellious high school girl who lives and breathes rock 'n roll. riff is obsessed with writing songs for the ramones, her favorite rock band. she keeps the school rockin', and encourages her fellow-students to join her in her jubilant antics.  meanwhile the school that riff attends, has just hired a brand-new principal, named ms. togar. she's a tall, intimidating amazon of a woman. and she vows to make the students 'toe-the-line'. she even has a couple of the students act as monitors, who report back to her with dirt on their classmates. ms. togar is especially determined to nab riff, and put a stop to riff's anarchic shenanigans. but riff has clever ways to foil togar, at every turn.  kudos to the superb performance of mary woronov, in her role as principal togar. mary is a legendary b movie actress. and in this film, she plays the fascist ms. togar, with sneering relish. pj soles as riff, turns in an electrifying performance. clint howard as the duplicitous eaglebauer, has lots of fun with his role.  the ramones perform many of their hit songs in this film. and so the viewer sees why the ramones were so influential, in the 70s punk rock scene. certainly, this is a good film for ramones fans. but even if you're not into the ramones, or punk rock, this movie is a terrific blast (literally) of energetic fun.",1
"this film is so bad - dialogues, story, actors and actresses - everything! - that it's hard to imagine that we'll see a worse movie this year or in the following years. ""love's brother"" (set in australia among italian immigrants) has nothing but shallow clichés about italian culture to offer, and it is quite telling that even the italians from and in italy speak english in the film. the message of the film - ugly people have to marry ugly people, beautiful people have to marry beautiful people - is truly discomforting. giovanni ribisi is quite good in films like 'suburbia' or 'lost in translation', but here his pseudo-italian accent is hard to bear. see this film at your own risk. trash as trash can!",0
"i find it hard to believe that anyone would put this movie in the same context as the exorcist. where the exorcist was subtle and creepy, stigmata was blunt, clumsy, and way too formulaic.  this is one of the most visually beautiful films i've seen in a while, but the imagery does not make up for the downward spiral of patronizing exposition that makes it unbearable.   my interest in this movie was peaked when it was compared to the exorcist, and my visit to the official web site increased that interest. the web site had many tales of ""actual"" stigmata throughout history. however, scene by scene, the movie is so obsessed by its quest for ""genuineness"" that it becomes comical at first, then outright hard to watch toward the end. i began getting suspicious when the priest charged with investigating potential miracles walks into the beauty parlor where our would-be heroine cuts hair and, evidently, flirts with priests.  the plot: a woman without faith in god begins receiving the wounds of christ (the stigmata) and is baffled and upset about the ordeal. a priest is sent straight from the vatican to investigate the case. is frankie possessed by satan, or a vessel for jesus christ?  the only miracle in this film is that it finally ends.",0
"it is cheese. if all you want is a video game, complete with what look like straight-from-the-computer cutaway sequences for action the film was too cheap to actually make special effects for, this is it. my friend and i actually had a great time seeing it, since the theatre was mostly empty and we could heckle a bit. this movie really requires heckling.  plot? there was a plot? ok, some stupid college or later types get invited to ""the rave of the year"" and go to one of the san juan islands (""if they'd only stayed back in seattle, they would have survived."" - direct quote, or nearly.) to attend. they get there and everyone is gone, and the site is somewhat wrecked (but hey, the keg is still full!). with the help of a crusty old captain and a coast guard woman (who acted only slightly less tough - and slightly less well - than cynthia rothrock), they fight lots of zombies (some which spit acid), get an earful of freaky legends, and mostly get killed. that's about it.  it's not quite as bad as demonicus, but not by much, and still better than severed (they are sort of my own personal alpha and omega for bad movies - the former is bad but fun to heckle, and the latter is just too freaking bad to watch more than once). on the other hand, if you're expecting a video game movie as excellent as resident evil, run away!!! run away now!!!  ok, some real big questions (without too many spoilers): since when did spanish ships of the 18th century venture into the pacific northwest????? why is anyone in the pacific northwest smuggling guns, and to whom - canada, for crying out loud??? why is a rave on an unnamed (oh, excuse me, it's called ""isla del muerto"", shya, right) san juan island - and outdoors, still keeping in mind this is the pacific northwet. and the rave has about 30 people in attendance - ""the rave of the year,"" my patoot.  lucky thing there's lots of hatchets around. lots of them. everyone has them. must be a hatchet sales outlet nearby.  finally, while the movie started out playing with a little ""parody"" (with nudges at i know what you did and jaws), it didn't carry it through near enough.  ok, really finally - when the introductory comments (in a voice-over, no less) casually mention that one of the characters ""gave up her boyfriend to focus on her fencing"" you can be darn sure there'll be some fencing by the end of the movie. not good fencing, but a couple of people hacking at each other with swords, anyway.",0

"i don't think this is too bad of a show under the right conditions. i tolerated the first season.  unfortunately, this is a show about lawyers who aren't really lawyers. god forbid anybody actually go to law school based on these shows, which i had heard was the case when i watched some interviews of the show. it just made me gag a bit.  that aside, spader and shatner, who are supposed to be the stars of the show, are the most annoying. while this might be a compliment in some situations, it's certainly not here. their constantly harassing the women on the show is funny at first. but since that's what they're doing literally all the time, i've realized that this is as deep as the show is going to get. trying to intersperse some serious, dramatic, and even tear-jerking moments in the middle of this mockery of a real show fails to compensate for the progressive loss of interest i've been experiencing trying to enjoy the show.  alan shore's flamboyant and gratuitous ""public service announcements"" where he spouts off his opinions do not impress. denny crane is just annoying. i was embarrassed for him and for the writers of the show for crane's speech wearing a colonial outfit.  i'm giving two stars because there are moments where i thought the show's attempts to deal with some contemporary issues were done with care.  i think the show's writers became aware that the sexual harassment displayed by denny and alan was getting overbearing even to those who were more inviting of them from the start. the thing is, i don't care if the sexual harassment treatment in the show is done well, but i just felt that the writer was insulting me with artificially implanting sexual banters all over the show in the hopes that my libido will keep me coming back for more. i'm not a teenager anymore, and i think this show is promising if its goal wasn't to cater to the lowest common denominator to get ratings.  of course, i'm writing this after i realized that it's really not gonna get much better than this. it's a shame because it's one of those shows i'd love to love.",0
"in the periphery of são paulo, the very low middle-class dysfunctional and hypocrite family of teodoro (giulio lopes), cláudia (leona cavalli) and the teenager soninha (sílvia lourenço) have deep secrets. the religious teodoro is indeed a hit-man, hired to kill people in the neighborhood with his friend waldomiro (ailton graça). he has a lover, the very devout woman terezinha (martha meola), and he wants to regenerate, going to the country with her. cláudia has a young lover, júlio (ismael de araújo), who delivers meats for his father's butcher shop. soninha is a common sixteen years old teenager of the periphery, having active sexual life, smoking grass and loving heavy metal. when júlio is killed and castrated in their neighborhood, the lives of the members of the family change.  ""contra todos"" is a great low budget brazilian movie that pictures the life in the periphery of a big brazilian city. the story is very real, uses the usual elements of the poor area of the big brazilian cities (drug dealers, hit men, fanatic religious evangelic people, hopeless teenagers etc.), has many plot points and a surprising end, and the characters have excellent performances, acting very natural and making the story totally believable. the camera follows the characters, giving a great dynamics to the film. in the extras of the dvd, the director roberto moreira explains that his screenplay had no lines, only the description of the situations, and was partially disclosed only one week before the beginning of the shootings. the actors have trainings in workshops and they used lots of improvisation, being the reason for such natural acting. my vote is eight.  title (brazil): ""contra todos"" (""against everybody"")",1

"gotta start with ed furlong on this one. you gotta. god bless this kid. $5 bucks says the character he plays in this film is what he's really like in real life. he has a one-liner or two that made me almost blow snot because of the subtle humor in the script. you know all the trials this guy has gone through in recent years and it doesn't even seem like furlong is even acting. maybe that's why his performance was good. same with madsen. you keep thinking, ""i bet this guy is really like this in real life."" does madsen even have to act? just natural. vosloo has obviously moved on from the type-casted mummy guy. i think the biggest surprise to this film was jordana spiro's performance. her reactions are spot-on in this film. i battled if she was hot or not, but realized i would just like to see more of her.   not a big fan of shoot 'em out/hostage type films. but what i am a fan of are films with lots of twists and turns to try and keep you guessing. it's not just your standard robbers take over a bank, they kill hostages, and the good guys win in the end type of film. the twists keep on coming...and coming.  the café scenes work best with the hand-held cams to show what it's really like in there. not glossed over a bit. think like bourne ultimatum ""lite"" style on some scenes in the café.  and for those bo bice fanatics out there - actor curtis wayne (who plays karl) will make you do a double take. these guys are twins.  as i watched i wondered why some of the actors had foreign accents and what were they doing in this small town. made sense in the end that these people smuggled stuff to other countries/states so they might have these accents. but more is revealed in the bonus features of how some of the producers wanted to make this film for international audiences with some of their stars we might not have heard of. and some of them are smoking hot. moncia dean? need i say more.",1

"like a latter day ayn rand, bigelow is la major muy macho in her depiction in the film of a few tough american hombres stuck in iraq defusing roadside bombs set by the ruthless, relentless, child-killing arab terrorists. as bigelow posits the iraq war as the backdrop of the grand stage of human drama, one veteran bomb expert gets blown up and another shows up to replace him in the dusty, hot, ugly rubble that is iraq, and a new hero is born.  the new guy is what john hershey described in his book, and later the movie, the war lover, as a sadistic wingnut who actually isn't fit for civilian life, and requires the stimulation of war to sublimate and suppress his errant sexual desires. the war lover can only fully function in war, peacetime suffocates him. while hershey chastised the war lover, (played in the film by steve mcqueen in one of his greatest roles) bigelow glorifies him. the army needs war lovers, they are the bulwark of defense against our enemies. we can't handle the truth, that it is war lovers who are the best soldiers, the toughest men. according to the unironic bigelow, regular men are pussies, the war lover is a special breed, the last of the cowboys. so what if he wants to bare-back his men, or fondle an iraqi boy? he is a throwback to the sex-and-death cult of war. in war, sex is a thankless, loveless, don't-ask, don't-tell kind of male bonding. bigelow has no opinion on this; she just limits the options of masculinity in this ham-fisted attempt at realism. only a war-lover can win the moral struggle between right and wrong, between american innocence and arab perfidy. bigelow disguises her racism and arrogance behind the ingenuous facade of journalism. she's just another gung-ho yahoo depicting a brutal war against civilians as a moral triumph of the spirit.  on the political front, bigelow returns to the western genre and its relentless clichés again and again, ad nauseam: the wonderful world of the open frontier, which happens to be some one else's country. (""you can shoot people here"" says a soldier ); the tough but human black guy companion, the soldier with a premonition of death, the gruff, possibly crazy commanding officer, the college-educated fool who tries to befriend the enemy. you name it, bigelow resurrects it.  the man-boy love is palpable in scenes with the cute arab boy who befriends the war lover, but bigelow plays it straight; she doesn't consummate the sex, just sanitizes it. what bigelow really wants to show us is the ugly, sneering face of the arab enemy. any iraqi who isn't pure evil is either demented, hostile or up to no good, anyway. they all deserve to die for their impudence, and many of them do in this glib gore-fest film. the iraqi women are all hysterical, they only make their presence known by screaming. they could be male stunt men in drag for all i know, you never see their faces. there is no female presence at all on base or in battle, although female casualty rates in iraq would certainly disprove this.  bigelow goes through all the motions one by one. she glorifies war, she canonizes the sadist nut-case hero. the cowboys, surrounded by the subhuman indians, prove their mettle by doing god's work and subduing the wretched terrorist-infested hellhole with sheer bravado and suicidal mania. toward the end, i felt like rooting for the indians. in bigelow's world, though, no mercy or understanding ever makes it through. the iraqis are dehumanized par excellence. the slaughter of civilians is just the dramatic backdrop to our hero's psycho sexual struggle. every u.s, bullet finds its mark. you have to love the guy, the war lover. it's just his way, he is the true hero. he's just a guy trying to get things done the hard way, and so what if he lusts for boy tang on the side.",0

"okay, what the hell kind of trash have i been watching now? ""the witches' mountain"" has got to be one of the most incoherent and insane spanish exploitation flicks ever and yet, at the same time, it's also strangely compelling. there's absolutely nothing that makes sense here and i even doubt there ever was a script to work with, but somehow i couldn't turn it off. the scratching your head with confusion starts right away, with an opening sequence about an angry little girl that killed her mother's cat. so you think this film revolves on children possessed by evil forces? heck no, because after this intro, the girl and her wickedness simply aren't mentioned anymore. then cut to a guy, with the most impressively trimmed mustache you'll ever see, who breaks up with his girlfriend in a rather unsubtle way. when she asks him to spend his vacation with her, he promptly phones his employer requesting him any type of assignment! great move. the movie finally starts now, as he travels to an isolated mountain area to photograph some peaks. though not before he picks up a new girl (patty shepard) and photographs her topless! throughout their journey, all kind of strange events occur that  you guessed it  are never explained. the girl wakes up in the middle of the forest, loud petrifying music plays everywhere and someone even steals the jeep! really, car jacking witches? apparently a coven of silent witches owns the mountains and they practice voodoo on trespassers. that's as close as i get describing the plot, but there's a good chance i'm way off more important here is the atmosphere! ""the witches' mountain"" is occasionally very creepy, with its spooky music and interesting cinematography. the supportive characters all look uncanny and the ravishing patty shepard plays a good heroine. this is the type of european horror film that could have been legendary, if only someone had bothered to write a structured screenplay.",0
"diagnosis murder is one of the only programs i watch regularly on tv now. the way all of the main characters have something to do in each of the episodes makes it so unlike today's shows where they concentrate on 1 or 2 people per episode and everyone else is shoved to the side. the way mark's brain works is also so obscure that you never really know what he is thinking, and if you think you do, you are wrong.  diagnosis murder has tackled a diverse range of topics, not just in the cases but in each of the characters personal lives. everything from racism and adoption, to terrorists and technology.  as for it being for old people? i am 24!! i don't think i can be classed as old yet.  i just want to know when they will be releasing all 8 seasons on dvd (not ntsc) so that i can watch them all in order. they seem to be doing it with lots of other programs from the same era so can they hurry it up a bit!",1

"i found myself at sixes and sevens while watching this one. altman's touch with zooms in and out were there, and i expected those devices to comment on characters and situations. unfortunately, as far as i could see, they sometimes were gratuitous, sometimes witty, often barren for failing to point out some ironic or other connection. in particular, two zoom-outs from the gilt dome in savannah merely perplexed. to be fair, though, a few zooms (outs and ins) to branagh heightened his character's increasing bewilderment, a la pudgy mccabe's or philip marlow's. on the whole, the zooms were, well, inconsistent, and sometimes even trite.  other almanesque devices, such as multiple panes of glass between camera and subject, succeeded in suggesting characters' sollipsism or narcissism or opaque states of knowledge. car windshields, house windows, and other screens were used effectively and fairly consistently, i felt, harking back to the player and even the long goodbye. a few catchy jump-cuts, especially to a suggestive tv commercial, reminded me of such usage in short cuts, to sardonic effect.  but finally, the mismatch between altman's very personal style and the sheer weight of the grisham-genre momentum, failed to excite me. this director's 1970s masterpieces revised and deconstructed various classic genres, including the chandler detective film which this resembled in some ways; this time around, the director seemed to have too few arrows in his analytic quiver to strike any meaningful blow to the soft underbelly of this beastly genre. was he muzzled in by mammonist producers, perhaps? or am i missing something, due to my feeble knowledge of the genre he takes on here?  nonetheless, the casting was excellent all around: tom berenger (for his terrifying ferality), branagh for his (deflated) hubris, robert downey jr's pheromonal haze, robert duvall's method of trash, and davidtz's lurking femme-fatality were near perfect choices all. and except for a few slips out of georgia into chicago on the part of (brunette?) daryl hannah, accents were convincingly southern.  suspense and mood were engrossing, even if the story didn't quite rivet viewers. the moodiness of a coastal pre-hurricane barometric plunge was exquisitely, painstakingly rendered--i felt like yelling at the usher to turn on the swamp cooler pronto.  torn, in the end i judged it a 7.

"i'm sick of people whining about ewoks! true, they're not the best thing that ever happened to star wars, but they did happen, so deal with it! besides, they are cute, and i don't care if they're marketable. yubb nubb!  this movie always leaves me in tears. it's perfect. the end could not be better. i'm excited for the phantom menace because it will suddenly throw the focus of the whole story from luke to anakin. i love how he is revealed at the end - it would be too unresolved any other way. so those of you who are complaining that vader's helmet was removed, take a moment to think about it. it's very effective. vader, the man who hid behind a mask for 20 years, is finally revealed as a sick-looking man. he is not entirely machine - he's vulnerable.  i don't know how the casting director happened to pick such good actors in a new hope. they all do so well. they are believable characters. hamill does an excellent job with his dramatic character development. fisher does a fine job being a female role model (i mean, come on! she killed jabba even when so many others had failed!). harrison ford - need i say more?  the music is once again brilliant. it's so very touching and significant when you can pick out character themes at different parts of the movie. the best climax is when luke shouts ""nooo!"" and jumps out to fight his father in the final battle. john williams is nothing short of a genius! what an amazing man!  already, the movie has so much more meaning for me because of episode i. i can't wait to finally see it in the theatres (can i wait???) and then watch the original trilogy yet again.  bravo!",1
"this wasn't what i wanted to see. i bought this on dvd and under the movie i found myself irritated and turned off the movie for a moment.  heres what i didn't like:  1 they were shooting at the father  2 the tribes was really annoying  3 the dinosaurs (mostly)looked to faked  4 the bad scientist well he was annoying  5 the picture quality on the dvd was really bad  what i did like:   1 the music by jerry goldsmith. this music is really great. i have the bootleg soundtrack from this movie. sadly the sound quality is not good, but its ok for its time.  2 the first time we see the dinosaurs they inspire a sort of awe.  3 baby is kinda cute when he is in the water and is playing  4 that funny scene with the tent.   5 the children who sees this film would hopefully learn that evil always loses.",0
"look, i'm sorry if half the world takes offense at this, but life is confusing enough. i don't need to watch it that way. i dig anthony hopkins, big time. i even watched fracture, and i knew that would be a steaming pile of quentin. but this thing is not well shot, and it's not daring--even if it is artsy. well-produced films have reasons for cuts and fast edits, not this ""oh, but it's a realistic interpretation"" excuse. this thing'll make your head hurt. it's the fastest moving picture ever to take you nowhere at all. i still love ah, and i'll always give him another chance, but if you aren't made of time to watch bad ideas on screen, skip this.",0

"will smith delivers yet again in a film about a man with the weight of the world on his shoulders and his crusade to right his wrongs in a way that will touch even the most hardened of hearts!!! writer grant nieporte and italian director gabriele muccino come together and created a masterpiece that i highly recommend to purchase and keep in your movie collection as you will never grow tired of watching/feeling this film!!! i have the highest respects for will smith as he is not only a brilliant actor but one can tell he has a genuine love for people and life which no doubt made him perfect for the character (irs agent ben thomas) he played in this film. you will find yourself feeling his pain and anger, the frustrations over his love for emily, played by rosario dawson, who by the way was fantastic as usual. i found myself falling in love with the fact their characters were falling in love. woody harrelson also stars in this top notch film. i find it very difficult to write this review without giving away key plot points...all i can say is, watch it and when you do make sure you have nothing to interrupt you, take the phone off the hook, sit back and get ready to start trying to unravel the mysterious life and past of irs agent ben thomas...i thank you will smith for another great film!!!",1
"spanish films are into a, if not golden, definitely a silver age. piédras is another example of a movie that takes people and their conflicts seriously. although the feelings are strong or nearly at life or death-level, they still aren't really melodramatic. this could happen.  there are different stories here, which become connected. one is about the retarded girl, who doesn't dare to pass the street to the next block. one is about the middle-aged woman who finds the lover of her life in a foot fetischist. another is about the girl with drug problems who's lover leaves her. still another one is about the madame of a brothel who (almost) finds true love.  definitely worth seeing. it's in spain the moviemakers take women seriously.",1
"when i saw this as a child, it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that i had. it is easy to watch because it is animated, which makes it unthreatening. it has no moral bias or ""preachy"" aspects, so nobody should have any objections to it. it is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring, ""matter-of-fact"" way. i hope to show it to my daughter.",1
"extremely interesting and intriguing movie. the similarities to david lynch (who is even quoted literally by the presence of red curtains in the film) and the novels of franz kafka (the house keeper in this film is called mrs. grubach, as is the one in der prozess...) are clearly present but in this case are accompanied by clear references to the colonial past of belgium in africa. the exact content of the movie i can not clearly describe: this colonialism is an important part, as is the inability to cope with such a past, but the personal memories of the main character are a central issue as well, and his quest for social contact and love. these are the symbolic themes i deduced from the movie, but in fact they're no more than impressions.  but even if you just try to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you still will discover an extremely fascinating movie filled with splendid imagery (beautiful close ups of beatles, larvas and other nasty insects are alternated with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere lends the film extra style). maybe you can say that i didn't quite 'get' the film, but i have been watching like hypnothised for 1.5 hour, deeply impressed by the visual quality and the fascinating mysteriosity.",1
"i happen to have bought one of those ""legacy of horror"" 50 movie pack collections and would you believe i'm still looking through them to find a good horror movie in it. sometimes you find an enjoyable yet campy one like the devil's messenger or the devil bat, or one of the great alfred hitchcock's films (some aren't horror however and are only on there because hitchcock directed some horrors and suspense) but other times it seems that they put movies like the island monster and this on because they can't accept the fact they would easily be forgotten and should be for that matter.  so we open up to sort of a westing game idea. the rich yet cruel and abusive father played by carradine (the one standing feature of this) has died and left his inheritance to his children and servants who he still hates. carradine gives a good enough performance as always, but he's left mainly in a voice recording and flashback sequences leaving us to sit through the mediocre/terrible performances. the rest of the cast either overacts or underacts in scenes. given this was an independent film of the 70's the lighting and effects are pretty limited. it's hard to build a lot of tension when the viewer can't see what's happening that well in some scenes. some actors like the servants igor and elga give an effort at least and i'm ashamed to admit kind of left me chuckling at the end mainly for the sheer stupidity but still with some very minor happiness that they pulled some version of a twist to an otherwise pretty obvious who-done-it but not enough to enhance the quality of the film. you aren't meant to like the characters as they are either selfish and cruel or psychotic, but it takes it to a whole new level and makes many unwatchable. the death scenes are pretty bad and the suspense is not really there. it proves that you would probably enjoy the 20 movie pack ""chilling"" containing films like house on a haunted hill, little shop of horror's with jack nicholson, and night of the living dead over it. this is best avoided.",0
"stan laurel and oliver hardy had extensive (separate) film careers before they were eventually teamed. for many of ollie's pre-stan films, he was billed on screen as babe hardy ... and throughout his adult life, hardy was known to his friends as 'babe'. while touring postwar britain with laurel in a music-hall act for bernard delfont, hardy gave an interview to journalist john mccabe in which he explained the origin of this nickname: early in his acting career, hardy got a shave from a gay hairdresser who squeezed hardy's plump cheeks (the ones on his face) and said 'nice baby!' hardy's workmates started crying him 'babe', and the nickname stuck.  although much of hardy's pre-laurel work is very interesting -- notably his comedy roles in support of larry semon and the chaplin imitator billy west -- his teamwork with billy ruge (who?) in a series of low-budget shorts for the vim comedy film company is very dire indeed. hardy and ruge were given the screen names plump and runt: names which are unpleasant in their own right, but made worse because ruge (although shorter than hardy) isn't especially a runt. seen here, hardy looks much as he does in his early hal roach films with laurel ... but without the spit curls and the fastidious little moustache.  'one too many', an absolutely typical plunt and runt epic, is direly unfunny ... and its dreichness is made even more conspicuous by the fact that this film has exactly the same premise as 'that's my wife', one of laurel and hardy's most hilarious films. plump (hardy) is the star boarder in a rooming-house run by a tall gawky landlady. runt (ruge) is the porter. plump receives a letter from his wealthy uncle john, whose dosh he expects to inherit. his uncle is coming to see him and to meet plump's wife and baby. there's only one problem: plump hasn't got a wife and baby. he's been lying to his uncle in order to seem a family man. now, of course, plump expects runt to find him a wife and baby on short notice. of course, the results are disastrous. it would be nice if those disastrous results were funny, but they aren't. most of the unfunny humour here is just empty slapstick, with characters settling their arguments by shoving each other into bathtubs.  spoilers coming. vim director will louis (who?) shows no instinct for camera framing: the actress who plays the landlady is significantly taller than hardy, and louis consistently sets up his shots so that her head is out of frame. this could be funny if done on purpose, but it's merely inept. at one point in this bad comedy, an extremely tasteless gag is looming on the horizon as runt approaches a black laundress. 'surely they wouldn't stoop that low for a laugh,' i thought. but they do. runt steals the woman's black infant and tries to fob this off as plump's progeny.  somehow, plump acquires an infant's cot, but he still hasn't got a baby. with uncle john coming up the stairs, plump conscripts runt for babyhood. this gag might just possibly have worked with a midget, or even with a truly runt-sized actor such as chester conklin, but billy ruge is only slightly below average height. ruge's impersonation of a baby is neither believable nor funny, and uncle john would have to be a complete moron to fall for it. amazingly, he does!  the most notable aspect of 'one too many' is a brief appearance -- apparently her only-ever film appearance -- by madelyn saloshin, oliver hardy's first wife. the marriage was not a happy one, although hardy's marital troubles never attained the epic proportions of stan laurel's.   only one thing in this movie impressed me. there is a very brief flashback sequence, with hardy reminiscing about his seaside romance with a bathing beauty. in 1916, there was still not yet a standard film grammar for conveying flashbacks: the one shown here is done gracefully and simply. too bad this movie has no other merits. 'one too many' is definitely one film too many on oliver hardy's cv, and i'll rate this movie just one point out of 10. laurel and hardy together are definitely much funnier than either of them separately.",0
"six different couples. six different love stories. six different love angles. eighty numbers of audience in the movie theater. looking at the eighty different parts of the silver screen.  i am sitting in somewhere between them looking at the center of the screen to find out what's going on in the movie. all stories have got no link with each other, but somewhere down the line nikhil advani trying to show some relation between them. i tried to find out a few lines i could write as review but at the end of 3 hours 15 minutes found nothing to write. the movie is a poor copy of hollywood blockbuster love actually.  my suggestion. don't watch the movie if you really want to watch a nice movie.",0
"follow-up to 1973's ""walking tall"" continues the real-life drama surrounding tennessee sheriff buford pusser, but this installment plays like a lame tv-movie. bo svenson takes over the lead role from joe don baker, but he's much too mild for the part; he comes off like an ambling country singer with a bat instead of a guitar. good supporting actors like richard jaekel, luke askew and robert doqui end up with very little to do. i would give the film one-star strictly on its good intentions, but the screenplay is a transparent and lazy mass of routine predicaments and the production is cheapjack. followed in 1977 by ""final chapter-walking tall"" and in 1978 by the television film ""a real american hero"".",0
"if you are a fan of zorro, indiana jones, or action in general this is a must-see. directed by republic's ace team of william witney and john english, and starring reed hadley as don diego/zorro, this serial delivers! i won't bore you with the plot (who cares? less talking, more fighting); what really matters here is hadley's superb interpretation of the character/s and the stunt work of dale van sickel and yakima canutt.   ***stunt spoilers follow ***  you can see the influence this film had on lucas and spielberg -- zorro gets caught in the original version of the star wars trash compactor in one chapter, trapped on a rope bridge a'la temple of doom in another, does a raiders horse-to-coach transfer and even flees through a tunnel while the baddies knock over a huge water tank and flood the tunnel behind him, exactly as mola ram does to indy in temple of doom. in addition to all this, the whip action is great as zorro disarms villains, swings to safety, etc. with his trusty lash. most of the sword work is fair to lame, except for chapter one, which features a terrific sword brawl in a cantina choreographed by sword/stunt legend ralph faulkner, who makes a rare screen appearance as the evil rodriguez. this was the first serial i ever saw, on matinée at the bijou when i was a kid and i have been hooked on them ever since.   zorro's fighting legion delivers ""z"" goods!",1

"one of director miike takashi's very best. it's so good it's difficult to put into words. at nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to end.  it recalls similar children's films from the 1980s in the sense that (unlike today) those films weren't afraid to scare - there's a lot of nasty detail here that i initially found jarring but soon realised it's nothing different to what i grew up on. the film is a compilation of '80s kid's films conventions. you name it, it's there: a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappy/dysfunctional world into another, inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins; a quest to save both worlds from an evil force; a beautiful heroine he has a crush on; a sadistic henchwoman (go-go yubari from kill bill vol. 1); a lead villain who draws his evil power from something everyone in the world can relate to. but all these genre conventions are given a fresh spin and added depth.  one of the imdb reviews begins ""where was this film when i was a kid?"" and it's a sentiment i agree with wholeheartedly. even while watching it i lamented the fact that i hadn't grown up on it; that it wasn't a part of my childhood like labyrinth, masters of the universe and, to a much lesser extent, the neverending story. those films, and others like the goonies are recalled but never copied - miike relentlessly offering us a new take on things.  poor cgi is a staple of many of his films, sometimes due to budgetary limitations but just as frequently an artistic choice - a desire to present things in an outlandish way. here the cgi is mostly average, solely due to budgetary limitations, but nevertheless he does a fantastic job of putting on a spectacle. the cg effects combine with traditional puppets, animatronics and truly extraordinary make-up to create a world filled with rich characters (and characterisation) that frequently borders on the visionary.  this ranks as one of the greatest children's films ever made. not for younger or more sensitive kids though.  just jaw-droppingly wonderful. see it for yourselves and if you think your kids can handle/appreciate it then show it to them. let them grow up on the great yokai war as some small compensation for the fact you couldn't.",1
"i had absolutely nothing to do the past weekend, and tagged along with my friends to check out a movie...any movie. and since the only movie we'd not seen was inspector gadget, we decided to go in for that.  big mistake. this is a movie that might appeal only to kids. oh, and it's not like i don't enjoy movies targeted at the younger audience. but this movie had absolutely nothing to hold my attention. if you have nothing to do at home, go to sleep. better than wasting hard-earned cash on this. go check out the film if you're a kid or if you're a parent with a kid :)",0
"i don't know much about film-making, but good movies have to tell some sort of a story...your characters have to start and complete their journey. in last exit to brooklyn they may, but its not in any satisfying way, and i'm not meaning a happy ending, just any ending.  last exit to brooklyn, set in 1952 brooklyn during a very brutal labor strike, sets a number of story threads in motion. most involve some of the most unlikeable characters to ever walk across a movie screen. but last exit to brooklyn fails to bring these stories to any conclusion...it leaves some of them dangling with no ending, or blasts off into some bizarre stratosphere for an ""artistic"" ending.  two cases in point, and they contain spoilers.  a sad transvestite character (an important character in the film), is struck by a car and killed. and that's it for him in the movie....he's gone for good, erased from everyone's memory..no reactions from his friends, enemies, lovers....nothing.  in another thread the stupid, clueless, and secretly gay strike leader, having been rejected by labor, his gay lover, and found out by the neighborhood thugs, gets stomped by the thugs. the closing scene to the beating shows the streets of brooklyn, and the streetlights are very, very similar to those of nazi death camps...and the scene drags on and on and on...and the camera pans down to the body of the labor leader, and he's been crucified.....ppppuuuulllleeeeeez. and of course that's it for him too....brain erasure.....gone.  bottom line....no matter what the reviewers originally said in 1989 about this film....this movie is a depressing piece of sludge. avoid it. and if you don't be forewarned, it really deserves an nc-17 rating for massive amounts of physical, emotional and sexual brutality...don't even let the teenagers watch.",0
"this is a great ""small"" film. i say ""small"" because it doesn't have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions, as in a john woo film. great performances by roy scheider and the three ""bad guys"". john frankenheimer seems to have more luck with small productions these days. the film is very easy to watch, the story is more of a yarn than a washing machine--instead of everything going around and around, it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens. wonderful ending, very positive. i never read the elmore leonard book, but it can't be much different from the film because it feels like i'm watching an elmore leonard movie.",1
"i thought this was a very good movie. it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the movie about the 2 sisters knowing about each liking the same boy before he was killed off. i'm sure if the movie had been done this way there would have been a very different ending, that's why this made this move such a good movie. it shows that no matter what happens in your life with your siblings that you can always get thru it and that if it's 2 sisters dealing with a boy, (the same boy) that working thru the pain and hurt makes things to seem better and easier to work out between the 2 of them. it's nice to see love stories that have a terrible thing to happen in someone's life that you can still get thru it become even closer after its over. i really enjoyed watching this movie, and i still do now when it comes on. i seem to find myself watching it every time it comes on. it would have been nice if there would have been a part 2 for this movie, maybe having the older sister to come up and have his baby, this would really have made a great finish to the story since he died, this way it would keep him alive even though he's dead.",1
"first and foremost, i loved the novel by ray bradbury. it's the kind of horror that gets under your skin and sticks with you later. it was one of his best books, with, you know, fahrenheit 451 and dandelion wine. i as just hoping that this movie would be all right. it had lots of chances, with a great cast, like jason robards and jonathn pryce. and bradbury even wrote the script himself. and on top of all that, it has pam grier!  how could it fail?  there may be spoilers within.  first of all, it was dumbed down. much of the horror from the book was lost as bradbury must have been forced to keep the violence to a minimum. all the visuals from the book...gone. everything that made you squirm...gone.  and then there's the acting. like a lot of movies that disney threw out in the 80s, the kids in this movie cannot act. and, this bugged me a lot, neither of them looked 13 but 9 or 10. their strong friendship wasn't addressed. it was more like they were acquaintaces.   you'd think jason robards and jonathan pryce could pull this off in their roles of mr. halloway and mr. dark. but here it's like they just don't care. all they want to do is somehow pay off some mortgage or something. this is far from being some of their best performances.   pam grier was fine as the witch, but the charecter of the dust witch herself wasn't well pulled off. she's a lot less evil and doesn't have the presence as she did in the book.   and everything that was left out of the book. the ballon night chase, the marking of jim's house, the real death of mr. dark, what happened to mr. coogan on the merry-go-round, the fate of the lightening rod salesman, the real death of the witch, and oh so much more.   and the special effects were bad, even for the 80s. the merry-go-round of doom for one thing with the superimposed horses going around wasn't really creepy, and that weird green mist that really had nothing to do with anything.   i could keep going about how this movie ripped apart the original novel, but it makes blood boil. don't see this movie but read the book. it's a classic of bradbury.",0
"i went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the son of sam had on the society. i didn't expect spike lee to force-feed me more garbage on racial tension, mob-justice, or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers. lee has presented an extreme opinion.  the entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90-min format with more focus, less tangential sub-plots.  don't even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy spike lee; in such a case, the theatre is worth it. this is not an escapist movie.",0
"the tenuous connection between this film and the first grease is established right at the beginning of the film when didi conn one of four cast members repeating their roles approaches young maxwell caulfield who is a british exchange student. although in the previous film olivia newton st. john's foreign speech pattern is not explained, it's explained here caulfield is her cousin. what's conn still doing in school, i guess she just likes hanging around rydell high even though now she's a beautician.  caulfield's a smart kid, so of course the hood types led by adrian zmed have him labeled as a nerd. and that's especially bad when zmed's girl friend decides she likes caulfield. but being a nerd just isn't going to cut it.  that's when caulfield decides to put on a modern day zorro act. he gets a junked bicycle and puts it back together and teaches himself to ride. he gets himself a leather biker outfit with a set of goggles to hide his face. if getting michelle pheiffer is not in the cards, caulfield won't have any trouble making friends at any gay male leather bar the way he's outfitted.  grease 2 introduced michelle pheiffer and maxwell caulfield and started them on the successful career paths both have enjoyed. if you saw the first grease film, a much better film, than you definitely have an idea how this film will turn out.  in addition to conn, eve arden, sid caesar, and dody goodman, all faculty members from the original grease return in their roles. the music score isn't remotely as good as the songs that come from the original.  it's not that grease 2 is bad, it's just not all that great.",0
"""the shop around the corner"" is one of the great films from director ernst lubitsch. in addition to the talents of james stewart and margaret sullavan, it's filled with a terrific cast of top character actors such as frank morgan and felix bressart .they're the type of character actors that hollywood sadly no longer employs. in fact, the film itself is the kind of movie that hollywood doesn't make anymore. (the makers of ""you've got mail"" claim their film to be a remake, but that's just nothing but a lot of inflated self praise.) anyway, if you have an affection for romantic comedies of the 1940's, you'll find ""the shop around the corner"" to be nothing short of wonderful. just as good with repeat viewings. enjoy!",1
"this is simply the funniest movie i've seen in a long time. the bad acting, bad script, bad scenery, bad costumes, bad camera work and bad special effects are so stupid that you find yourself reeling with laughter.  so it's not gonna win an oscar but if you've got beer and friends round then you can't go wrong.",1
"first of all, i loved bruce broughton's music score, very lyrical, and this alone added to the film's charm. the best aspect of the movie were the three animals, superlatively voiced by michael j.fox, sally field and the late don ameche. whereas fox has the funniest lines, ameche plays a rather brooding otherwise engaging character(the voice of reason), and field adds wit into a character that is always seen telling chance off. the humans weren't as engaging, and sometimes the film dragged, but that is my only complaint. this is one beautiful-looking film, with beautiful close up shots of canada, i believe. although the film itself is quite long, there is never a seriously dull moment, and this is advantaged by the voice work and a well-written script. all in all, a charming and perhaps underrated film, with a 9/10 from me. bethany cox.",1
"because of the 1988 writers guild of america strike they had to shoot this episode in 3 days. it's pretty much crap, consisting of repeat cut + pasted clips from season 2 and was described by its writer, maurice hurley as ""terrible, just terrible.""   why the producers couldn't just wait to shoot something decent who knows. i'm guessing because of the strike the production ran out of money and could only release a flashback episode or maybe roddenberry was too sick at the time to be able to veto this half-assery. this episode also marks the final appearance of diana muldaur (dr. katherine pulaski) on the series.",0
"i saw a preview of freebird at the isle of man tt as i had heard about it in a couple of motorcycle mags. although i was over mainly for the racing, the lure of seeing phil daniels in a motorcycle movie (yes i love quadrophenia like everyone else) proved enough to get me away from the beer and partying. at last! we've done it! us british have actually made a great motorcycle film (and no it's not like torque) this is up there with the best of british comedy. mark my words, this is phil daniels best screen performance, and as far as geoff bell is concerned, there's a new british legend making his name felt. i loved gary stretch in shane meadows' fantastic dead mans shoes and here he gives a quietly touching performance that he can proudly add to his growing film reputation. this is a film not just for us bikers, but i think for everyone (even my girlfriend loved it). i hope it gets the same brilliant response on the mainland as it got at the isle of man. i'm not going to go into the details of certain classic scenes that this movie has, (watch out for the shop), as it would spoil the fun, but i would say, go see, enjoy, and have one of the best nights in the cinema you've had in a while. i really think this could well be a cult classic. as they were saying at the tt... c'mon freebird!",1
"for some reason, various young couples hiking through the italian alps split up to see who can reach their campsite designation first. james (gregory lee kenyon) enters a cave, finds a skeleton of an ancient demonic gladiator and becomes possessed by the spirit of ""tyranus"" when he puts on a helmet belonging to the corpse. he then spends the rest of the film running around in the woods hunting down his friends and hacking off their limbs to add to some stew to bring the undead ""demonicus"" back to life. this shot-on-digital full moon release is stupid, senseless, has terrible acting and sound and the (los) angeles national forest is a poor substitute for italy. however, it's pretty high on the unintentional laugh scale thanks mainly to the overwrought lead performance. whether bug-eyed running around in cheap-looking armor brandishing a sword or spouting neurotic latin gibberish about demons and resurrection, kenyon's ridiculous facial expressions and awkward line delivery must be seen to be believed. oh well, at least he's not boring like most of the rest of the cast.",0
"i just can't agree with the above comment - there's lots of interesting and indeed amazing filmic imagery in this one, it has an unusual structure and moves well toward a frightening climactic sequence that is notable for it's effective use of silence. what's more, it explores the odd impulse of suicide in a very frank way, not pulling any punches in what it shows, yet not dwelling and over-sensationalising the subject matter. it has hints of documentary about it as well as horror and art-house cinema, and deserves a place amongst the canon of 'different' horror films like the blair witch project and the original ring (both of which it predates and could well be an unacknowledged influence on). it's definitely worth seeing if you're interested in the edges of horror cinema.",1
"i honestly had somewhat high expectations when i first began to watch this movie, but it turned out to be probably one of the most boring films i have ever seen!  first of all, the pace is incredibly slow, so it seems much longer than it is (and it's not short).i'm sure when jane austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with description, and didn't intend for people to read in in one day, or it might drag and lose it's appeal, which ""emma"" most certainly did. now ""sense and sensibility"" had this flaw of a slow pace, but at least it had lively lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances!  that brings me to flaw #2, which is of course, the acting. while i don't happen to care for basically anybody involved in this film, i am sure they are capable of good work, but i didn't see much of it in this movie. it was like people were trying too hard to be witty, too hard to be ""upper-class"", too hard to be british (well, some of them), so they all just came off as a bunch of actors and not as people.  #3. the cast, as i said, seemed only like actors, and not actually like the people they were playing. maybe that's a good thing, because the people they played really weren't all that nice. why did everybody like emma, for example? sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was an awful gossip behind their backs. if her friends were ""ugly"", then she didn't even bother to go behind their backs. so, why is this girl so great? why do people have to tell stories, ""just to make her laugh?"" of course the snob couldn't even do that right. i have enough problems with gwyneth paltrow as gwyneth paltrow, and her ""emma"" did not exactly change my opinion.  well, it's easy to see that i did not care for this one. i'm sure it's a lovely book and all, but some books are really not meant to be made for the big screen, and ""emma"" is one of them.",0
"0*'s christian slater, tara reid, stephen dorff, frank c. turner, mathew walker, will sanderson. directed by uwe boll.  based on the video game director uwe boll attempts to recreate the game into an action-packed nail biter sadly he doesn't succeed. instead he makes one of the worst movies ever made! even though he gets minor celebrity such as christian slater, tara reid and stephen dorff his movie lacks the necessary fundamentals that a movie needs to be good such as a story line, and some basic relativity of what's going on in the dark and the light. the movie bounces all around and uwe boll has no creative control. and not to mention the bad cgi used on making the monsters. even though they did look cool and the feedings were well, a little lame. honestly this is one of the worst movies ever made. my final rating 0/10.",0
"hood of the living dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored (lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing). i find that 95% of amateur movies and 90% of home video footage is better than this film (although the similarities between them warrant the comparison).

"i remember watching this film a while ago and after seeing 3000 miles to graceland, it all came flooding back. why this hasn't had a video or dvd release yet? it's sacrilegious that this majesty of movie making has never been released while other rubbish has been. in fact this is the one john carpenter film that hasn't been released. in fact i haven't seen it on the tv either since the day i watched it. kurt russell was the perfect choice for the role of elvis. this is definitely a role he was born to play. john carpenter's break from horror brought this gem that i'd love the tv to play again. it is well acted and well performed as far as the singing goes. belting out most of elvis's greatest hits with gusto. i think this also was the film that formed the partnership with russell and carpenter which made them go on to make a number of great movies (escape from new york, the thing, big trouble in little china, and escape from l.a. someone has got to release this before someone does a remake or their own version of his life, which i feel would not only tarnish the king but also ruin the magic that this one has. if this doesn't get released then we are gonna be in heartbreak hotel.",1
"this film was a yawn from titles to credits, it's boring to the point of tedium and the acting is wooden and stilted! admittedly this was director richard jobson directing debut, but who on earth green-lit a script as poorly developed as this one? looks like another money down the drain government project (scottish screen are credited surprise, surprise). i nearly fell asleep three times and my review will unfortunately have to be more restrained than this one. please, please mister jobson what ever you've been doing prior to directing this sedative of a film, go back to it!",0
"i really don't understand why people get so upset and pan this movie! remember folks, this is an snl movie, not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction! the ladies man is a hilarious movie, albeit stupid at times, with a wacked-out cast and, as usual, wonderful performances by will ferrel and tim meadows. yes some of the jokes are stupid, and yes, the characters are unbelievable but its comedy! i really don't understand how anyone couldn't laugh a lot during this hilarious film. anyway, all i ask is that people take this as it is--an snl, silly and irreverent comedy. nothing that will win awards, but nonetheless, some modern comedy gold.

"here's how you do it: believe in god and repent for your sins. then things should turn around within the next day or so.   until the last fifteen minutes, this movie just plays as a bad recap of a drunk's crappy life. his mom dies. his stepmom's a b_tch. his dad dies. he drinks. he gets married. he has kids. he drinks some more. his wife gets mad. he disappoints his kids. the wife threatens to leave. he calls up a reverend late night b/c he wants to kill himself. then after the recap happens, that's when we get the ""left behind""-like subtle message.  ""he needed a paycheck"". this is the phrase i had to repeat over and over once credits started to roll so i wouldn't lose my respect for madsen.  madsen drops to his knees and begs christ's forgiveness. once he does, he walks outside and actually says that he sees the world in a different way. he tells his wife that he's found god and that's good enough for her. flip scene four months and the wife is tired of going to church. end the movie as madsen walks by the bar and gives a soliloquy about how happy he is with christ and without alcohol. final moment? he gives a little dismissive wave to the bar (i.e. sin house) and give a gay, miami-vice, after-school special congratulatory jump in the air as the camera freeze-frames. see why i had to repeat the phrase? ""he needed a paycheck"".  man this movie is bad. the b-grade 80's production values don't help much. the script could have easily been a ""touched by an angel"" episode. it could have been knocked out in 30 minutes plus commercials. the acting is wooden and never believable. even madsen, of whom i'm a big fan and is the sole reason i sat through this, makes it clear that this is his first acting job and he doesn't know his a$$ from his elbow yet on camera. 45 minutes into it i started to get discouraged. this thing was like homework. i just wanted to put it away and say that alright, i saw half of it. that's good enough. but no. if i sat through cheerleader ninjas, i could sit throughout this.  the only reason i'm not giving this thing a 1 is for two points: 1) i love madsen. i know it's not fair. but it's great seeing the opening title ""introducing michael madsen"". sue me. 2) some of the dialogue is so bad that it's classic. i'll stick some quotes at the end of this so you can enjoy them too.  that's about it. to wrap it up ,this thing is a piece of crap that should stay flushed with the rest of the turds. but hey! look! michael madsen! (see also tilt, executive target, my boss's daughter, etc). now i've gotta rewatch reservoir dogs and watch madsen torture a cop to get my respect back for him. see ya, kids.  ""this stuff's gonna make me go blind, but i'm gonna drink it anyway"" - madsen's first taste of cheap alcohol  ""i don't understand! everything seems so beautiful!"" - madsen walking outside after confessing to god  ""i'm going downtown later and pick up a bible and i'm gonna get a haircut too"" - madsen after converting at the dinner table, because satan lives in your hair",0
"didn't know anything about the movie before watching and i think it was the ""no expectation"" factor that helped me endure at first and later like it more than i anticipated.  the setting was interesting, strange but interesting. the storyline had gaps/jumps that i think throws the audience off a bit. there's no great soundtrack playing in the background, creating the ""romantic"" ambiance. but they all didn't matter.  the chemistry between emma and luis was simply exquisite. there was some inexplicable strange chemistry that i couldn't resist; i fell in love with it and here i am, writing this review. the subtle love portrayal by the two actors was superb, and i believe, that is the core of this movie.  this movie is not an everyday romantic comedy; in fact, not all of us will appreciate it. i had to sit a while and then slowly began to comprehend the little things i didn't catch at first. i cannot guarantee everyone will like it, but i hope you do.",1
"saw this my last day at the festival, and was glad i stuck around that extra couple of days. poetic, moving, and most surprisingly, funny, in it's own strange way. it's so rare to see directors working in this style who are able to find true strangeness and humor in a hyper-realistic world, without seeming precious, or upsetting the balance. manages to seem both improvised, yet completely controlled. it i hesitate to make comparisons, because these filmmakers have really digested their influences (cassavetes, malick, loach, altman...the usual suspects) and found their own unique style, but if you like modern directors in this tradition (lynne ramsay, david gordon greene), you're in for a real treat. this is a wonderful film, and i hope more people get to see it. if this film plays in a festival in your city, go! go! go!",1
"the premise may seem goofy, but since murphy's character doesn't take it seriously, it helps ease the audience into this mix of mysticism and modern-day hard-boiled child abduction. excellent cast, particularly charles dance and charlotte lewis, and murphy is at the height of his 80's peak in comedy/action. there's also some great f/x, a very surreal dream sequence, and a fairly original plot. often overlooked in the pantheon of murphy flicks, but this one is worth a look.",1
"first of all, the reason i'm giving this film 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least peter falk gave his usual fantastic performance as lieutenant columbo. he alone can get 10 stars for trying to save this otherwise utterly worthless attempt at making a movie.  i was initially all fired up at reading one poster's comment that andrew stevens in this movie gave ""the performance of his career."" to me, it was the abysmal performance by stevens that absolutely ruined this movie, and so i was all prepared to hurl all sorts of insults at the person who made the aforementioned comment. then i thought to myself, what else has stevens done? so i checked and, you know, that person was absolutely right. in the 17 years since this columbo movie was made, apparently every one of the 33 projects that stevens has been in since then has been utter crap, so it is doubtful that anybody has even seen the rest of his career.  if you like columbo, see every other of the 69 titles before watching this one. do yourself a favor and save the worst for last.",0
"there are two movie experiences i will always cherish. the first was seeing ""star wars"" for the first time at the age of 10 with my little brother. a close second is sneaking into halloween at the tripple plex with my good friend, trevor, in late october 1978. halloween left me breathless, speechless, and downright scared. everyone knows the story. young michael myers decides to kill his sister on halloween 1963. he escapes a mental hospital 15 years later to return to haddofield to wreck havoc once again. he spots laurie (jamie lee curtis), a shy senior who enjoys babysitting, and begins stalking her. her partying friends across the street are killed, one-by-one as michael sets his plot to get her. ironically, the young boy she tends on halloween is afraid of the ""boogeman,"" and can see him outside. during the murder spree, dr. sam loomis (donald pleasance) works hard to find michael before he unleashes his fury. he has no proof, no evidence, just a hunch he has to sell to sheriff bracket (charles cyphers). as the plot unfolds, you have a suspense-driven movie instead of a cheap thrill scare. alfred hitchcock once said, ""you can have four men at a table playing cards and they don't know there is a bomb and it goes off. that is a cheap thrill. however, put four men at a table who discover a bomb and discuss what to do about it--then it doesn't go off, then you have suspense."" director john carpenter takes that advice to the hilt in halloween. the audience will see glimpses of him outside, watching, stalking his victims. we gasp. will he kill her? when will he kill her? then, michael disappears. carpenter also uses the suspense in lieu of special effects that usually highlight the gore. this movie has little blood, but still provides good scares. one of the best scenes is michael lifting bob off the ground. he rears the knife back as it glints off the moonlight, then he drives it. all you hear is a loud thud, then the audience sees bob's feet drop lifelessly. carpenter was the first to use a vantage point from the scene of the killer. this also peaks our audience. what will he do? what's going on inside his mind? finally, carpenter's hauntingly masterful score adds to the tension. moreover, the tandem screen writing he did with debra hill gives us a story which develops characters we care about. the teens are not ""party mad,"" but merely going through the rebellious angst of teenage wasteland. finally, there is some decent acting in this ""b,"" low-budget thriller. nick castle who plays ""the shape"" (michael) adds something to the mindless killer. it is cold, merciless, and without any pathology. moreover, the personality does everything the same way. he kills only when trapped, or to set up a trap. he splits the victims apart. he also relies on brute strength. and that mask used (a bleached william shatner mask) gives an impression of something that has no soul or emotion. while pleasance is melodramatic in his deadpan monologues, he comes across as someone scared, desperate, and determined. it made me wonder if he represented modernism's fading attempt to explain evil. the crown jewel, though, is jamie lee curtis' debut. she plays the laurie character as someone scared, but also determined and strong who fights back. the end is one that left me speechless. this was the first concept of an indestructible serial killer who could not be stopped. movies like star wars have the advantage that it can be enjoyed numerous times. halloween, and other scary movies, though, do not have that advantage. so if we could erase our minds of the first time we see a movie to experience it again as fresh and new, halloween would be the movie i would choose.",1
"""ko to tamo peva"" is one of the best films i ever saw. a tragicomedy with very deep implications on the fate of humankind shown through the eyes of seemingly very plain and common people from a god-forsaken serbian province just before the start of the world war ii. i saw it in a small movie theater in russia where the film had had a very limited distribution, and i had no chance to come across it ever since. it is such a pity that this excellent film is almost forgotten now. i searched for a vhs or dvd copy of it many times, and alas - could find none. i would be most grateful to other fans of this little gem of movie-making for a suggestion of the ways to purchase a copy.",1
"strange, almost all reviewers are highly positive about this movie. is it because it's from 1975 and has chamberlain and curtis in it and therefore forgive the by times very bad acting and childish ways of storytelling?   maybe it's because some people get sentimental about this film because they have read the book? (i have not read the book, but i don't think that's a problem, film makers never presume that the viewers have read the book).   or is it because i am subconsciously irritated about the fact that english-speaking actors try to behave as their french counterparts?",0
"this is one of those movies that you happen across when you're channel surfing on a saturday afternoon, and you get drawn into it and end up watching the whole thing. i thought that it was well acted and it really made me feel for the characters. though it's a bit slow moving, focusing more on the relationships between bonnie and clyde and their family members, it never got boring. we don't really see too much of all the robberies that they were so legendary for, and instead most of the shootouts take place when they're ambushed by the police. i thought tracey needham, who played bonnie, really did a good job with her character. going from a nice country girl to a cold-blooded killer is a challenging thing to portray, and i enjoyed the subtlety she brought to the role.  overall, an above average effort, especially considering it was a made for tv movie.",1
"i purchased the dvd set on a recommendation from amazon.com based on my other interests. they hit the nail on the head with this one. i remember watching the show when it was on tv but always wondered what happened to it. ten years later, it's like watching it all again for the first time. lucas black as caleb temple and gary cole as sheriff lucas buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. almost representing good (caleb) and evil (sherriff lucas buck). i never really understood exactly what lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that i don't believe were granted by anything holy. he can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. none the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. all in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others i can think of, (i.e. point pleasant, threshold, nowhere man, and seaquest dsv just to name a few) were cancelled way before their time. the steven king's the dead zone ( sunday's usa network) seems to be the only thing in this genre that seems to be making it. there is just nothing fit to watch on tv anymore. this is because anything that deals with christianity and satan is considered offensive and must be immediately pulled from tv. so, in the meantime, i'll just keep buying dvd sets and watching shows that should still be on tv but were booted off tv by religious zealots so we could watch ""quality"" shows like family guy and american dad and the simpsons (what a bunch of crap that is).",1
"reda is a young frenchman of moroccan descent. despite his muslim heritage, he is very french in attitudes and values. out of the blue, his father announces that reda will be driving him to the hajj (pilgrimage) to mecca--something that reda has no interest in doing but agrees only out of obligation. as a result, from the start, reda is angry but being a traditional muslim man, his father is difficult to talk to or discuss his misgivings. both father and son seem very rigid and inflexible--and it's very ironic when the dad tells his son that he should not be so stubborn.  when i read the summary, it talks about how much the characters grew and began to know each other. however, i really don't think they did and that is the fascinating and sad aspect of the film. sure, there were times of understanding, but so often there was an undercurrent of hostility and repression. i actually liked this and appreciated that there wasn't complete resolution of this--as it would have seemed phony.  overall, the film is well acted and fascinating--giving westerners an unusual insight into islam and the hajj. it also provides a fascinating juxtaposition of traditional islam and the secular younger generation. while the slow pace and lack of clarity about the relationship throughout the film may annoy some, i think it gave the film intense realism and made it look like a film about people--not some formula. a nice and unusual film.",1

"most war films made in the us during wwii were great fun to watch but suffered from severe gaps in realism because they were being produced more for propaganda value to raise the spirits at home than anything else. i am not knocking these films as many of them are still very watchable. however, because they so often lack realism they are prevented from being truly great films. a perfect example was the john garfield film air force--in which a b-17 nearly single-handedly takes out half the japanese air force! however, pride of the marines is a welcome departure--scoring high marks for portraying a true story in a reasonably accurate manner. when i first saw this film, i thought it was not a true story as it seemed way too improbable to be true. however, after researching further i found that it was in fact rather true to the amazing story of two men who did so much to earn the medal of honor. this is one case where real life seemed too incredible to be true!",1
"while i don't agree with bob's and tammy's decision to give up baby jesse, and it's something i'd never do, they were trying to do what was best for the baby. the way this movie is written, you see yourself becoming wrapped up in the story and asking yourself what you really believe, from all different aspects. patty duke? antagonist? almost unheard of, as far as i'm concerned. but during the movie, she really convinces you that she's psychotic, or at least, that there's something seriously wrong with her. her character is the meaning of ""emotionally disturbed."" the movie seems to end quickly, leaving things somewhat unresolved. but other than that, this movie is really great. it really makes you think. it's not a movie to watch when you just want to kick back and relax and watch something cute that'll make you laugh. but it is a good movie to see when you want to challenge your own beliefs, see things from others' perspectives, and discover a little something about yourself. caution: you may even grow while watching this movie! and it's all worth it, in the end.",1

"this movie had potential, but what makes it really bad is lindsay crouse's acting. i've never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some crouse fans out there that like her in something else, but her performance in this movie is bad.  her delivery is robotic. when she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head. so, her voice has very little inflection. i can't believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie. she has to know somebody in the biz.  now i hate to be this mean about her, but the comment has to be ""this"" long and her performance is what sticks out more than anything else.  however, i liked where the story was going so i continued to watch it. the first part of the script has the makings of a good movie. but the end was disappointing as well. maybe if her acting had been better, i would have liked it.",0

"ok. not bad movie making if it were from an original script. but it is not!  which part of ""in this story there are no women, except for foulata and gagoola"" introduction by haggard did the producers, directors and writers not understand? i mean, it is pretty plain english. i understood it at age 10!. the beauty of ksm is that it contains a spectacular description of three different worlds, the colonial africa, the unforgiving desert and kukuanaland, a hidden and isolated kingdom. that should be more than enough for even the most mediocre of producers to work with. but, nooo, they have to throw ""romance"" into it. pathetic. suggestion to all you poor souls who actually thought this would be close to the book. give it up. until a peter jackson wannabe comes along and ""does it right"" you may as well keep re-reading the tome. btw, there is a sequel book (actually a pre-quel) called allan's wife. it gives background to the story of quatermain. it is a bit creepy but good.",0
"the sarah silverman program is very similar to sarah's own stand up; it's so over the top with prejudice that you can't possibly take it to heart. the fact is, though, that while most all people will ""get it,"" it doesn't mean they will all appreciate it. it's a very polarizing and one dimensional show, so if you don't like it after 10 minutes, you may as well give up there. if you do like it after 10 minutes, stay tuned, because every episode thus far has been as good as the last.  like all shows, though, it is not perfect. personally i love the program, but there are some huge faults with it. racist songs are funny, but get older a lot faster than silverman seems to realize--a problem that i had with ""jesus is magic"" as well. it seems as if silverman gave herself a quota for songs per episode that doesn't need to exist. not to mention that while the lyrics to the songs she writes are good, the music, well, isn't.  another thing to keep in mind is that while this show will for some reason appeal to fans of monty python, upright citizens brigade, etc., it is nothing like those shows. i can watch monty python all day, but, as much as i like this show, i can't watch more than the half hour limit at a time. it gets flat very fast. the repeat value for this show is low too--the second time around an episode is fairly funny, and by the third time, in my opinion, it's boring.  still, that first time around is very, very funny. give it a shot.",1
"just when you thought it was safe to go back into the water...  another computer generated mutant croc on the prowl for human lunchmeat, let loose by another one of those facilities conducting mad science. gereco biotech company is fooling around with growth hormone research, accidentally releasing a baby crocodile which is evolving at an accelerating rate.  b-movie cast add a deal of fun to this run of the mill ""genetic mistake monster movie"". costas mandylor evokes mick dundee, aussie accent, hat, big ass knife, the works, as a croc specialist hired by gereco executive joanna pacula(..wasted in the stereotypical role of corrupt administrative executive who denies any involvement with the gigantic beast her facility let free on innocent people). charles napier is the local sheriff whose town is in danger and jane longenecker is his hot daughter, who works at the animal shelter. soap opera star matthew borlenghi is longenecker's love interest, a local artist who welds sculptures(..his brother is a victim of the croc). of course, this skill will come in mighty handy when our heroes set up a created trap for the croc, hoping to poison it with carbon monoxide.  the croc itself is never the least bit convincing as it rampages through a reserve looking for food, the special effects of a low grade variety. in regards to roger corman productions dealing with renegade dino-monsters, i stick with carnosaur. the monster here is essentially a crocodile standing on it's hind legs, often upright as it pursues potential victims. i felt mandylor and the filmmakers were spoofing crocodile dundee with his croc hunter, and this imitation might amuse where the monster itself fails. borlenghi and longenecker actually have pretty good chemistry together on screen. as expected, pacula gets her commuppance in hilarious fashion(..gulp).",0
"for anyone who wishes to get an impression of the soviet view of modern russian history this monumental film is a treasure. the story starts at the turn of the century (1900) in the yellowish sepia colours of old photographs which improves to black and white during the middle of the century and to full colour when the story approaches modern times (i.e. the 1960s).  the story focuses on a boy in a remote siberian village, who is marked by the arrival and arrest of an anarchist during the czarist era. he later joins the bolsheviks after the revolution and brings soviet communism to his village. his son, by the local beauty, fights the germans during the second world war. when he returns to the village, the oil industry takes off and we are treated to some soviet economic idealism.  this film is long and slow, but utterly logic and very well made. it can be seen in three parts.",1
"office work, especially in this era of computers, multi-functional copy machines, e-mail, voice mail, snail mail and `temps,' is territory ripe with satirical possibilities, a vein previously tapped in such films as `clockwatchers' and `office space,' and very successfully. this latest addition to the temp/humor pool, however, `haiku tunnel,' directed by josh kornbluth and jacob kornbluth, fails to live up to it's predecessors, and leaves the laughs somewhere outside the door, waiting for a chance to sneak in. unfortunately for the audience, that chance never comes; so what you get is a nice try, but as the man once said, no cigar.  	as the narrator/star of the film, josh kornbluth (playing josh kornbluth), points out in the opening frames (in a monologue delivered directly into the camera), this story is pure fiction, and takes place in the fictional city of `san franc'l'isco.' it's an innovative, if not very imaginatively presented disclaimer, and not all that funny. it is, however, a harbinger of what is to follow, all of which-- like the disclaimer-- just isn't all that funny.  	kornbluth plays kornbluth, an aspiring novelist who supports himself working as a `temp.' it's a job that suits him, and it gives him time to slip in some work on his novel from time to time. but when he goes to work for a lawyer, bob shelby (warren keith), he does too good a job on the first day, and shelby dispatches head secretary marlina d'amore (helen shumaker) to kornbluth to persuade him to go `perm.' the thought of working full time for the same company, though, initially strikes fear in the heart of kornbluth, but he caves in and signs on for the position. he's nervous about it, but at least now the other secretaries acknowledge his presence (which, of course, they would never do with a temp), and if things get too rough, he has seventeen important letters he's typed up-- that now just have to be mailed out-- to fall back on (he's been holding them back because the mailing is the easy part, and he needs that `something easy to do' in reserve, in case it all gets to be too much for him). these are `important' letters, however, and by the end of the week, kornbluth still has them in reserve, on his desk. and it doesn't take a genius to figure out that when shelby finds out about it, kornbluth's days as the fair-haired boy are going to be over. and quick.  	the brothers kornbluth, who not only directed, but along with john bellucci also wrote the screenplay for this film, should have taken a page out of the ben stiller book of comedy, where it says `if you play it straight, they will laugh.' but, they didn't, and the audience won't. because in comedy, even looking at it as objectively as possible, when the main character (as well as most of the supporting characters, in this case) `plays' funny-- as in, he `knows' he's being funny-- he never is. and that's exactly what kornbluth does here; so rather than being `funny,' he comes across as insincere and pretentious, a grievous error in judgment on the part of the kornbluths, because by allowing it, they sabotaged their own movie.   	in trying to discern exactly why this movie doesn't work, it comes down to two basic reasons: the directing, which-- if not necessarily `bad'-- is at least careless; and secondly, the performances, beginning with that of josh kornbluth. quite simply, kornbluth just seems too impressed with himself to be effective here. unlike stiller, or even steve martin-- both of whom use self-deprecating humor very effectively-- kornbluth apparently has an ego that simply will not allow putting himself in that light; he seems to have a need to let his audience know that he, the real kornbluth, is in reality much more clever than kornbluth the character. and being unable to get past that does him in, as well as the film. rather than give the millions of office workers who may see this film someone to whom they can relate or with whom they can identify, kornbluth affects a condescending manner that only serves to alienate the very people he is attempting to reach. so what it all comes down to is a case of poor directing and unconvincing acting, and when you take into consideration that the screenplay itself was weak to begin with, with an inexplicably narrow focus (given the potential of the rich subject matter), it's easy to understand why this one just doesn't fly.  	the one saving grace of the film is the performance by warren keith as shelby, whose subtle delivery is convincing, and which-- in and of itself-- is fairly humorous. the effectiveness of it is diminished, however, inasmuch as keith has to share his scenes with kornbluth, which somewhat automatically cancels out his positive contributions to the project.   	shumaker and sarah overman (julie faustino) also manage to keep their heads above water with their respective performances, which are commendable, if not entirely memorable; they at least make their scenes watchable, and overman even manages to elevate kornbluth's performance, if only momentarily. but it's still not enough to save the day or the film.  	the supporting cast includes amy resnick (mindy), brian thorstenson (clifford), june lomena (davonne), joe bellan (jimmy the mail clerk), with a cameo appearance by a disheveled looking harry shearer, as the orientation leader-- a role that begs for an answer to the question, `what was he thinking when he agreed to this?' in any work environment, there will forever be situations arising that one way or another will unavoidably become fodder for someone's comedic cannon, and the films depicting said situations will always be with us; the good ones (see paragraph one) may even become classics in their own right. `haiku tunnel,' however, will doubtfully remain very long amongst them, for it's destiny lies elsewhere-- in a realm known only as: `obscurity.' i rate this one 1/10.

dani(reese witherspoon) has always been very close with her older sister maureen(emily warfield) until they both start falling in love with their neighbor court(jason london). but it is not after a terrible tragedy strikes that the two sisters realize that nothing can keep them apart and that their love for each other will never fade away.  this was truly a heartbreaking story about first love. probably the most painful story about young love that i have ever seen. all the acting is amazing and reese witherspoon gives a great performance in her first movie. i would give the man in the moon 8.5/10,1
"this movie was very funny, i couldn't stop smiling when watching this and have already watched it twice in a period of 2 days! the movie is distinctively unique in it's humor and visuals, both are terrific and on par with natali's other (more serious) movie gems cube and cypher. i have become a huge vincenzo natali fan ever since watching cypher and everything he's made is very interesting.  very likable about this movie are the music and ""loser"" characters dave and andrew, portrayed by david hewlett and andrew miller (co-writer of the story), actors i both like very much. also cool are the x-box dead or alive fights (you even see dave playing halo at a point) and andrew's amazing guitar solo, among many other things.  all in all a great feel-good film about friendship. you have to see this!",1
"originally called the changer. the nostril picker is a poorly constructed tale about a loner named joe bukowski (carl zschering) who ""likes em young"". unable to socially interact with girls he bumps into a tramp who teaches him a special vietnamese chant. this ""chant"" involves whistling 'london bridge is falling down' whilst hopping around like an epileptic morris dancer. nonetheless, ugly joe tries it out and hey presto! he is now a girl. ideally he needs to be a young guy in order attract girls. but lets not talk about ideals here - this film was made in 1983 and released in 1993, in an ideal world it should have never been released.  the film asylum dubbed this horror hokum as ""mind numbing, ham handed story telling"". its worse than that. the nostril picker really takes the biscuit, in fact the whole god-damn cookie jar. terribly scripted dialogue delivered by brain-dead actors, a ridiculous plot and a predictable twist. just when things couldn't get any more absurd the story goes off on its own nonsensical tangent. for instance, joe decides to kill the girls by changing back into himself. but i thought he wanted to get close to them? not content with being a murderer joe also turns into a cannibal and eats some of his victims, of which there were only around 3-4.  the highlight of this terrible movie involves joe picking up a hooker (steven andrews) then taking ""her"" back to his apartment. what happens next defies belief... joe turns back into a man, but also discovers the hooker is a man. how does he react? well, in a benny hill-esquire fashion, he chases ""her"" around the apartment with a bunch of squirty dildo's only to trip up on a blow up doll. god knows what patrick j matthews and stephen hodge were thinking of. at least this scene paved the way for another priceless moment. this involved the male hooker reporting the incident to a curly haired police officer with a 2-bit joke shop 'cop' uniform. the hilarious acting is a must see. especially the hooker's inability at saying ""dildo"" and his demand for ""satisfaction"".  apart from the above mentioned incident this monotonous slash flick was a complete bore. you know a movie's bad when the dvd trailers were more exciting. normally, i'd fast forward to the good bits, only there weren't any here. the main action sequences involved joe simply stabbing his victims repeatedly. forget quick cuts, matthews utilizes fadeouts (one during a stab scene) to limit any form of suspense there might already be. one girl's non-reaction to her fingers being chopped off is laughable. normally i'd relish the words ""uncut"" but in this case they were far from a blessing. just more agonizing cinematic torture. the whole movie felt like an unedited episode of midsummer murders, only less entertaining. i'd hate to see the cut version.  to sum up, the nostril picker is the most unentertaining thing i've seen since richard hammond's 5 o' clock show. dismal performances made worse by a terribly tinny soundtrack and bad dubbing. don't be fooled by the box label, this is not a cult classic unless it qualifies for the lets-use-shitty-horror-dvds-for-coffee-coasters cult. which i think it does. unless re-edited to 30 minutes stay away from this coma inducing mess.",0
"a movie of outstanding brilliance and a poignant and unusual love story, the luzhin defence charts the intense attraction between an eccentric genius and a woman of beauty, depth and character.  	it gives john turturro what is probably his finest role to date (thank goodness they didn't give it to ralph fiennes, who would have murdered it.) similarly, emily watson shows the wealth of her experience (from her outstanding background on the stage). to reach the tortured chess master (turturro) her character has to display intelligence as well as a woman's love. watson does not portray beauty-pageant sexuality, but she brings to her parts a self-awareness that is alluring.  	in a chance meeting between natalia (watson) and luzhin, she casually stops him from losing a chess piece that has fallen through a hole in his clothing - a specially crafted piece that, we realize later in the film, has come to symbolize his hopes and aspirations. later, as their love affair develops, she subtly likens dancing to chess (luzhin has learnt to dance but never with a partner); she encourages him to lead her with ""bold, brilliant moves"" and in doing so enables him to relax sufficiently to later play at his best (and also realize himself as her lover).  	this is a story of a woman who inspires a man to his greatest achievement and, in so doing finds her own deepest fulfillment, emotionally and intellectually (or so we are led to believe - certainly, within the time frame, natalia is something of a liberated woman rather than someone who grooms herself to be a stereotypical wife and mother).  	the italian sets are stunning. the complexity of the characters and the skill with which the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent movie-goer, yet the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and most deservedly so. chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for developing an emotional and emotive movie, although the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess-player that the characters existed. although a tragedy of remarkable heights by a classic author, the final denouement is nevertheless surprisingly uplifting.",1
"peter bogdonavich has made a handful of truly great films, and they all laughed is one of his best. the cast couldn't be better equipped to play this light but slightly bittersweet screwball comedy. interestingly enough, the witty, light touch bogdonavich so effortlessly employs gives the film a rather disarming emotional core. fresh and immediate, the film starts with absolutely no explanation. there's no soundtrack music to cue us. we meet the characters in action, and as bogdonavich glides down the streets of new york, the film unfolds effortlessly. robby muller's camera captures it all with an understated simplicity that seems accidental, but surely isn't. the cast is terrific. in every way, a classic.",1
"a handful of critics have awarded this film with positive comments. i don't wish to argue with their opinion, but i strongly disagree. when i first watched this film i was mildly impressed. but after comparing it with other films, particularly with the late master, bruce lee i quickly changed my mind. in fact, if it wasn't for the title of the film, i would never have bought it. game of death 2 doesn't relate to the original game of death, (except it shares one character, billy lo.)  i was stunned to see how similar game of death 2 was compared to enter the dragon. the plots have striking similarities: both bruce lee and bobby lo are on a mission to avenge a relative. the two locations are similar, in which they both are very isolated and are surrounded by thousands of blackbelts. there is an element of prostitution in both films (women are sent two the guests rooms in both films.) both han (enter the dragon) and lewis's henchman have a hand missing. their is an underground drug operation in enter the dragon, believe it or not, there is one in game of death 2. han has a pet cat in enter the dragon, the director has used his imagination and awarded lewis with a pet monkey! the list continues.   regarding other aspects of the film, such as the script and the acting, i felt it was very poor. it seemed to me that the director was looking for a group of martial artists to star in the film and prayed they could act.   on a positive scale, i cannot deny that the choreography is impressive. although the fighting sequences have strong elements of acrobatics in them, they are none the less skillfully performed. however, as the plot is insufficient, i couldn't relate to the characters, therefore the fighting sequences were more exhibitions rather than having a meaning to the film.   in conclusion i would say this film is recommendable to any martial-arts fans, but for those who enjoy a solid action film, with a good storyline and strong characters, i seriously wouldn't recommend this film. my opinions towards this film may seem very bias and one-sided, but when bruce lee set a new standard in the martial arts cinema, particularly after his masterpiece: enter the dragon, this film failed to rise to these standards. if anything they imitated a truly brilliant martial-arts film, in hope of achieving the same level of fame.   in reference to my evaluation, awarding this film a very harsh 1 out of 10, the film is barley watchable, and must be thankful that it had the fighting sequences it did.",0
"if in the 90's you're adapting a book written in the 50's, set the bloody thing in the 50's and not the '90's. see, 40 year old mores and values tend not to play as well, or ring as true, that far down the road. it's a simple rule that hollywood habitually keeps violating. and that's the problem with this film. it should have been set in the era it was written in. you'd think that would be a no-brainer, but nooo. i'd elaborate, but bmacv's comment spells it out quite well. i'll limit my commentary to rachel ward. she looks like she dieted her ass completely out of existence for this role. as a result, she looks like a crack ho' on chemotherapy, and is about as sexy as a gay leather couch in drag. i found her ""i could die at any moment"" look quite disconcerting, and it greatly detracted from her supposed ""hotness"" and the ""sexual tension"" the film intended to create. other than that, the film was quite good; a 7+ out of 10.",1
"i have to finish watching a movie once i start, regardless of how bad it is. this movie was agonizing to sit through. the ""sparkling"" bullets, the reporter with ""ninja"" like moves, the way the bad guys shoot hundreds and hundreds of bullets and only seem to hit innocent bystanders, the predictable outcome and all the bad acting was just horrible. like the girl who finds the reporter in her friends apartment and goes from ""what the heck are you doing in here (holding a bat)"" to ""hey, you're cute, wanna @#$%!???"" in like 1.2 seconds.... just bad.... save yourself an hour and forty minutes and go play with your kids (or dog)!",0
"late one night on a desolate road, in an empty saloon martin sheen spins a yarn for robert carradine of hopalong cassidy and friends tracking a group of murderous cattle rustlers, who've killed a few men and kidnapped cassidy's girl.  writer/director christopher coppola may have incurred the wrath of william boyd purists by daring to make a modern low budget film featuring their beloved hoppy, but i'm glad he did it! no character should be so tied to an an actor that no one else ever be allowed to play him or her again!  i thought it was good fun and an interesting updating of the classic programmers of the thirties and forties. though guilty of some bad acting, this is earnest enough and unpretentious, making it hard for me to dislike.  the whole production is a bit odd though, but i really enjoyed the scenes between sheen and carridine. the fact that we're watching a story within a story makes the oddness and exaggerations more palatable.",1
"""i'm a cartoon!"" ""you're an illustration!"" what does that suppose to mean?! this plot could not be worse as a boy, who's afraid of everything, becomes very brave at the very end of the film because he went into a library. the only purpose of this waste of celluloid was to encourage american kids to read, when a cheaper, and more effective way of doing this could have been a series of adverts! even the talents of macaulay culkin(as the kid), christopher lloyd (as the so predictable ""that he's a the page master"" librarian), could save this pointless film from the dull plot. even the voices of whoopi goldberg, patrick stewart,(even) leonard nimoy, or the hollywood god of voices, frank welker as the cartoon characters don't save it ever. i can only describe it as a 1990s equivalent to the even ghastly 1978 adaption of the water babies, because the bland animation makes the film worse, not improving the dull plot!",0

"greenthumb grace is left penniless after her husbands death so she turns to ganja-growing in order to pay the bills. it sounds promising and the ever-reliable brenda blethyn doesn't disappoint but the material is sitcom-thin. there's actually a scene where grace asks her young gardener to ""give me one"" (a toke) and he thinks she's asking for sex and acts all awkward. yes, it's humour so twee a nun would be bored. saving grace doesn't seem to know what it wants to be: the stunning cinematography and stately pace evoke memories of ryan's daughter whilst the light-hearted whimsy of the country townsfolk could be lifted from any episode of antiques roadshow. it does speed up after the first hour but by then it's too clichéd to care. the climax manages to be unpredictable only by introducing the most shameless deux ex machina i've ever seen.",0
"i just saw this movie today with my children (son, 10 and daughter, 4.5) at the 3rd annual roger ebert overlooked film festival. after the film the children in the audience were allowed to ask questions to the director, tian-ming wu. he (through a translator) told several stories about his life and the making of the film.  all tangents aside, both of my children really enjoyed this movie. of course, i had to paraphrase many of the subtitles for my daughter, but much of the film is visually self-explanatory.  i won't give anything away, but the bottom line is that this film is so much better than 95% of the hollywood crap (especially children's films) out there.  cheers.  p.s. there is a ""real""/original king of masks who can/could do 12 masks at once. the actor in the movie trained and learned to do up to 4 masks at a time (then they would cut and change to 4 new masks).",1
"this film seemed way too long even at only 75 minutes. the problem with jungle horror films is that there is always way too much footage of people walking (through the jungle, up a rocky cliff, near a river or lake) to pad out the running time. the film is worth seeing for the laughable and naked native zombie with big bulging, bloody eyes which is always accompanied on the soundtrack with heavy breathing and lots of reverb. eurotrash fans will be plenty entertained by the bad english dubbing, gratuitous female flesh and very silly makeup jobs on the monster and native extras. for a zombie/cannibal flick this was pretty light on the gore but then i probably didn't see an uncut version.",0
"let me start by stating that i usually do like renny harlin's directing style, for the most part, and that the cinematographer should be commended for some the shots. unlike harlin's ""elm street 4"", and ""die hard 2"" which i really liked, there is something that is missing from this movie. that, my friends, is a script. the dialogue in movies like this is always pretty awful, but this one takes the gold medal for stupidity. there are so many awful lines in this movie, i don't even want to have to remember any of them. not just that but the execution of the lines is pathetic and seems more suited toward a bad porn movie than an action adventure. it's almost like harlin thought that if they slowed down the words being said, they could improve the script. wrong again.  the sad part is that there is some talented actors thrown into bad roles with worse dialogue. stallone has never been a favorite of mine, but when he is acting circles around lithgow, turner, and the worst of the bunch rooker, there is something wrong with this picture. lithgow played one of the best villains in ""ricochet"", yet comes across as someone who can't act to save his life here. how is that possible? i've always been a huge fan of his and he gets schooled in acting by stallone, who himself still phoned-in his performance. turner's part is so small and pointless, but she still manages to appear lost on screen. michael rooker can act. i know this because i have witnessed it in ""days of thunder"", but he seems like he is reading his lines from cue cards. has it come to this? when rooker and lithgow have scenes together where they are speaking, i just wanted the movie to end right there, or have them both amazingly find their acting ability. unfortunately, neither of those things occurred.  which brings me back to harlin, who can be the only one to really blame for this mess other than the screenwriters. it's his fault that i was never drawn into this movie at all, because he should have made the people actually act. the script is not very good, but still the actors' performances are what destroys this movie and that has to lie with the director. i don't care how much was paid for the special effects, which for the most part are good, you still can't just sacrifice the movie with terrible acting.   plus, the pacing of this movie seems to be off. the opening sequence was good and the plane scene was very well done, but how are you supposed to care about the outcome of the heist at all. i mean i understand that they were trying to create tension with all of the bells and whistles of the plane scene, but i really didn't care if they got the money or not in that scene. if the bad guy's would have won early, maybe i wouldn't have had to witness one of the worst movies ever!",0

"i am so appalled by this documentary. i am deeply embarrassed and ashamed by the way puertoricans were portrayed. this documentary was not about the culture of puertoricans. it was about the culture of nuyoricans. puertoricans and nuyoricans are two different cultures. very different cultures and should not be generalized to the puerto rican population. rosie, before you make a documentary, you need to do the research. you also need to check and make sure your sources are credible. puerto ricans are not all loud and they do have class, which is one thing the documentary lacked to show. when i saw rosie and jimmie on the view and rosie on martha stewart i was very excited about watching. i even made sure to let my parents know since they love puerto rico so much. after the first five minutes i could not believe how the documentary bashed the us and made puerto ricans look like a bunch of guinea pigs. you need to go and visit puerto rico and you will see that puerto rico is not a 3rd world country where more than 50% of the population is in poverty. puerto rico has colleges and well known universities, roads, cars, shopping centers, malls (the largest kmart and jcpenney's i've ever seen), restaurants, theaters, beaches, hotels(ritz, hilton,etc.), casinos, churches, agriculture, auto expresso, and restaurants just to name a few. poverty? not 50% of the population is. puerto rican culture is about family, music, food, celebrating, and trying to move forward not backward. oh, and new cousins don't just pop up out of no where. no that is not a puerto rican thing, that is a ghetto thing. we are not bastards. parents of puertorican descent who would like to teach their children about puerto rico should invest in a trip with the family so they can see first hand what puerto rico is all about. they will see its beauty, people and culture. please don't show them this documentary because it will only cloud their minds with negativity. oh, and please don't tell your american friends to watch this documentary because it will only make the puertorican people look ignorant.  yes, i am born and raised puerto rican from the island. just so you know!",0
"the film torrent was a first and a last for greta garbo. it was her first american made film at mgm, the only studio in the usa that she would ever work at. it was also the last time that someone else was billed above her in the credits, that being her leading man her ricardo cortez.  torrent is based on the popular spanish writer's vicente blasco ibanez's work entre naranjos. it concerns a pair of mismatched lovers, garbo and cortez, who can't quite get together, mostly due to the machinations of cortez's mother marta mattox.   mattox is a wicked woman who has some set ideas about who her son should be marrying. remember this is spain and such arranged marriages were still even in those times quite proper. mattox has gertrude olmstead in mind as a daughter-in-law, she's the offspring of mack swain a man grown rich in hog raising. swain provides a few moments of comic relief with his tender concern for the piglets before they grow into big old hogs to be butchered.  blasco ibanez had previous novels the four horseman of the apocalypse and blood and sand previously filmed with rudolph valentino in the lead. it might have been interesting if valentino had done this one with garbo, but he might have been beyond film making when this was done. in any event, one of the valentino wannabes ricardo cortez fills in with the male lead.  one reason valentino might not have wanted this film is because clearly the lead character is garbo's unlike the other two works previously mentioned. when she gets done dirt by cortez who is doing what mattox and her 'adviser' banker tully marshall tell her, she leaves spain and goes to france where she becomes a great opera star. and leads quite the scandalous life there.  when she returns to spain and tries to rekindle things, mattox is even more outraged. she has a political career in mind for her son. cortez is now running for the spanish parliament which curiously enough is called the cortes.   the title refers to a flood and a dam breaking causing all kinds of havoc in the countryside. cortez in fact braves the torrent in a row boat trying to rescue garbo from harm's way. when they do get together they have a brutally frank discussion, the brutality coming from garbo.  the special effects here, primitive though they seem now are quite remarkable for their time. they look very similar to the shots used in 20th century fox's the rains came that came out in 1939 and that won an oscar for special effects. unfortunately for torrent it came out one year before oscar made his debut.  i'm not going to give any endings away so you'll have to see the film to find out if cortez and garbo get together in the end. garbo rightly won rave reviews for her performance and in an age when exaggerated gestures was the norm in silent screen acting, she was remarkably subtle in her role. so she would be the rest of her career, she had a remarkable face for closeups.  although greta garbo would go on to do far better work than torrent, this film is still a fitting debut for her on the american big screen and holds up very well for today's audience.",1
"the movie shocked me. personally i had herd mostly bad buzz. well finally after owning the dvd for months now i pooped it in on a sleepless night. though the movie did drag the extra footage was used with purpose the seriousness of his passion and his recovery from addition to the game would have been less realistic if they had left out any scenes. the best thing about the movie is it's consistency with the relationship. there were no ex's popping up or characters threatening the relationship. i mean typically we see the girl meets boy by some amazing twist of fate,they date,something we saw coming breaks them up up and then they get back together in the last five minutes of the movie. but this movie did not follow that mold. we actually experienced the relationship and it's flaws and though the characters did have there moments of anti-love they did not have dramatic pauses were they went off and did a montage every 15 and then reunite in love again. i did not feel the movie was as predictable as the rest of the romance movies. the story was unique and truthful to reality in the way that i felt these people in the film were the most believable that i have seen in a romance film from modern times.and it did not hurt that all the baseball games were real and they were at the actual world series so fate kicked in a little there also. it's no ""my fair lady"" but it is a spirited and honest film. i'll simply say i like it.",1
"back in my high school days in salina kansas, they filmed something called ""the brave young men of weinberg"" locally, and the film crews were rather prominent for weeks. eventually, we learned that the film was ""up the academy"", and was a bit ummm, ""lower brow"" than we had been led to believe.   i had to see it, since i was there, and the local audiences seemed less than pleased at the showing. i was 17, and thought it was a rather artless attempt at a post ""animal house"" type of comedy, right down to the fart jokes.   watched it many times since, and my opinion has mellowed a bit. it's dumb, but at times it catches a bit of the ""mad"" magazine humor, at least as well as most ""mad tv"". ron liebman might hate it, but he is nearly perfect, and unforgettable. for me, my favorite moment would have been a brief scene on santa fe avenue, where i had parked my car, while i was buying some guitar strings. too bad my pinto's brief appearance, usually seems to get cut for tv. haven't seen the new dvd, but if my old pinto is visible, they've got a sale.",1
"this movie documents the harlem ball circuit of the mid eighties. much more fun than than palazzo volpi, though just as diseased, this movie is a true gem of squalor. one cannot help but sympathize with the characters because of their freakness . the sole purpose of middle class intellectuals is to document the phenomenons of the trash and the glitz. here the most genius of trash is extremely well documented and duly glamorized. the characters' penchant for idolatry of all that is glamorous inspires even more adoration of the characters themselves on part of the viewer, creating a ""phenomenon of a phenomenon"" effect which makes this movie a piece of art.",1
"the unborn is a pretty good low-budget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy. it's very well acted by the always-good brooke adams and b-movie stalwart james karen, although the supporting cast is pretty average for a b-grader. the music, by gary numan of all people, is good too. henry dominic's script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing, although there is a hint of misogyny about it. rodman fender's direction is merely adequate, and there are some unnecessary cheap scares. if you're a fan of adams, whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be, check it out; she's great, as always.",1
"barbra streisand's debut television special is still a pinnacle moment in entertainment history - in any media. cleverly divided into three separate acts (to minimize the interruption of commercial breaks), streisand made the bold-yet-masterful decision to drop the typical variety show format of the time (which is why there is no guest stars nor forced banter) and carry the entire show on her shoulders alone. the risky move paid off enormously, as my name is barbra set a new standard for musical programming on television.  filmed in glorious black-and-white (which actually adds to the effectiveness of the show), my name is barbra is flawlessly-conceived and impressively shot. however, what makes the show truly transcendent is streisand herself. watching the then-23 year old performer navigate herself through the show's 55 minute runtime is nothing less than thrilling. she is in fantastic voice (and even performs the entire first and third acts live), and gives first evidence of the immense star power that would soon follow her to the big screen.  the special's biggest asset is it's boldness in allowing streisand to simply stand on stage and sing some great songs. after the powerful opening performance of ""much more"" (with a brief opening snippet from leonard bernstein's ""my name is barbara""), barbra proceeds to wander through a multi-level studio set performing a frantic version of the disney classic ""i'm late."" in between verses of ""i'm late,"" streisand stops at various levels of the set to sing some terrific numbers such as the haunting ""make believe"" and the thundering ""how does the wine taste?"" halfway through the act i, barbra re-enters her own childhood to the strains of ""a kid again,"" and then gives highly energetic performances of ""i'm five"" and ""sweet zoo"" while romping among an over-sized set. the illusion is eventually shattered, however, as streisand finds herself out of the fantasy and back in the real world. she then sings about this lost childhood innocence in the lovely ""where is the wonder?"" streisand then dashes out onto a platform stage surrounded by an entire room-full of musicians and performs a rousing rendition of ""people"" before the thunderous applause of a live studio audience.  act ii of the special begins with streisand hamming it up for the studio audience with a campy rendition of ""i've got the blues,"" before delivering a comedy monologue about ""pearl from istanbul."" streisand then heads off to bergdorf goodman's department store, which allows her to sing a medley of poverty songs while parading around in some of the store's elegant fashions. this segment is the brightest highlight of the special for many fans and critics. some high points of the act ii medley include streisand singing a restrained version of ""second hand rose"" to the audience, appearing as a latin bullfighter to the tune of ""nobody knows you when you're down and out,"" and portraying a frustrated paperboy while mugging to ""brother, can you spare a dime."" the third act of the special is a straight concert, with no set pieces or concepts. streisand is a performer who really thrives on the concert stage, and this segment is the most thrilling moment of the special. streisand enters belting out an almost gravity-defying rendition of ""when the sun comes out,"" and continues to amaze the viewer with a lovely version of the yearling ballad ""why did i choose you,"" a scorching performance of ""lover come back to me,"" and an impassioned medley of three songs form funny girl. streisand really outdoes herself, however, with a phenomenal rendition of the fanny brice/billie holiday standard ""my man,"" which instantly became on of the singer's best-loved signature songs.  streisand performs her immortal ballad version of ""happy days are here again"" as the closing credits roll by on the left-hand side of the screen. the iconic finish to the number reaffirms to the viewer that he or she has indeed seen something truly special. my name is barbra was a huge rating triumph when first aired, and it eventually picked up five emmy awards in addition to spawning two top-five, gold-selling soundtrack albums. watching it all again, it's absolutely no surprise.",1
"it is difficult to evaluate this or any other comparable film of the early sound era in terms that one might use for ordinary film commentary. at times there is almost a desperation, as many film personalities of the silent era try their wings at sound, surely fearing that they will be left by the wayside (as did happen to some), rin-tin-tin. however, was pertfectly natural. in such a vaudeville of unrelated sequences, some were sure to stand out john barrymore's soliloquy from richard ii is a moment certainly worth preserving. by and large, only those with earlier stage training exuded confidence. however, this is over all reasonably entertaining, and a must for ""film buffs"" especially interested in the silent to sound transition",1
"very low-budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park, and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm. although released by rko, this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution. the cast and crew, with a few exceptions--among them a young and uncredited jack lord, director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner--are comprised of complete unknowns, and it shows. the performances are universally sub-par and wouldn't pass muster in a high school training film, the direction is stodgy and choppy and, as mentioned previously, there's no chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors. however, despite the film's many shortcomings, it does have a few good points. the location shooting in new york city, and the film's ultra-low budget, gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior ""the naked city"", a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled, and some of the investigating procedures are clever. otherwise, it's not much to write home about. it is worth a look, however, for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s, and old-car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of '30s and '40s cars in the streets.  .",0
"the good: i liked this movie because it was the first horror movie i've seen in a long time that actually scared me. the acting wasn't too bad, and the ""cupid"" killer was believable and disturbing.  the bad: the story line and plot of this movie is incredibly weak. there just wasn't much to it. the ways the killer killed his victims was very horrifying and disgusting. i do not recommend this movie to anyone who can not handle gore.  overall: a good scare, but a bad story.  ** out of *****",0

"i originally saw this movie as a boy at the old rialto theatre as part of a saturday afternoon matinée triple bill which also featured vincent price's ""last man on earth"" and mario bava's ""nightmare castle."" i had nightmares about blood lusting ghosts for a week afterwards! though i didn't know it then, all three movies would prove to be classics of the genre. no wonder i was so scared! though all three films frightened me, it was castle of blood that had the most profound impact.  it was the first on the bill. i didn't even get to see it from the beginning as we were late getting to the cinema and missed the first 20 minutes of the movie. that's lot to miss since the edited print only ran about 79 minutes (the unedited runs 87minutes). but despite this, the dark creepy atmosphere (complete with ruined castles, fog enshrouded cemeteries, shadows and cobwebs), gothic set design, strong acting, and suspense (especially the last 20 minutes) scared the bejeepers out of me and made a lasting impression it took me years to finally get a copy of the film for my collection. since it was a french - italian import, it wasn't a movie that showed up on the late show in winnipeg. i couldn't quite remember the title (remember i didn't get to seen the beginning of the film and was scared witless), and to make matters worse, the film had been released under literally a dozen different movie titles (aka danze macabre, coffin of terror, castle of terror, long night of terror, etc...) and the usa/uk working title ""castle of blood"" was very generic, similar to dozens of other ""b"" horror and suspense films, making it illusive. but thanks to the internet and perseverance, i found it at last! what a treat to finally watch the film in its entirety after so many years! it may not have had quite the sheer emotional impact that it did when i was a boy, but as haunted house movies go, it's stands up well and compares favourably to similar iconic films of the period such as ""the haunting,"" ""the innocents"" or ""black sunday,"" the film is a fine early effort of italian director antonio margheriti. it stars 60's scream queen icon barbara steele and features a well written screenplay by sergio corbucci about a sceptical writer (georges riviere) who, on a bet, spends the night in haunted house and unsuspectingly becomes part of an annual ongoing ghostly story. the hypnotic steele is well cast as the ghostly love interest - as is arturo dominici as dr. carmus, and margarete robsahm as julia.  many of the tricks margheriti employs to create the film's eerie atmosphere (cobwebs, creaking doors, fog, etc) are bound to seem cliché to a modern audience, but they work far more effectively in black and white than they ever could in modern day colour. rather than using body counts and special effects, the film creates scares the old fashion way, relying on a good story, stylish direction, fine set production, interesting camera work, and strong acting performances. margheriti does a marvellous job taking these elements and building the film's suspense as the horrifying paranormal secret of the house gradually reveals itself to the unwitting writer.  the film is not without faults. the pace drags at the beginning of the film (ironically, the 20 minutes i originally missed). this is probably worsened by synapse films effort to restore the film to its original length. though fans will likely appreciate the chance to see the film restored - in terms of the intro - it may have been more of hindrance than a help. the english voice dubs are merely passable and, in the restored scenes, the language shifts from english to french (english subtitles provided) which is sure to be annoying to some viewers.  however, synapse films deserves kudos for the quality of the print. clearly some effort was put into its restoration and deservedly so.  i enjoyed the film immensely and highly recommend it to aficionados of 60's italian goth films, or anyone who enjoys a good ghost story.  rob rheubottom winnipeg, mb canada",1

"the primary aspect of this film which most people miss is that luhzin lives his life as a chess game. so many people have seen this film and just don't get it, and i don't understand why. while watching this film i was taken on a private journey which floored me. i will try to explain this without any spoilers, but be forewarned, i do talk about things that happen in the movie.  **** possible spoilers **** be forewarned!****  his is a life of ""large moves"" versus ""small moves"". he chooses natalia to be his queen, and he and she behave as his aunt first described the king and queen and their moves when she introduced him to chess as a boy. listen closely to that description.  when someone asks him a question, he flashbacks to the past as if reviewing past moves. (the flashbacks are beautifully lit, by the way.) the flashbacks are quite interesting as well, for they give not only his point of view as a child, but the point of view of the other character as well. it's stunning.  various characters become either his helpers or his enemies, pawns, bishops and knights, their actions enlightening you as to who's side they are on. even their placement in a scene is pivotal to understanding what is going on. beautifully done.  i will not comment more on what happens to the character of luhzin, but i hope that this will illuminate what is actually happening at the end.  this film is constantly working on many levels, which is why i endorse it. it was a treat and a joy to watch.  if you like this film i would recommend a film called fresh. the only way that these films are similar is the use of chess and the characters being treated as pieces.

(*this plot takes so many turns that one has to just sit for a few minutes before they get hooked. marriage is a focus here that is often missed. early in the film they marry and we view the transition from being single to married. the film highlights some of the modern struggles a woman has when she marries an old fashioned man. it also brings into view the male ego with women and competition.)  bud is challenged and is excited when micky's puts in an electronic bull. sissy gets ideas of having fun on it too but is quickly reminded that she is married and need to start ""acting like it."" the emotion between the two characters is raw and expressive and the plot continues from there especially when they (note this is giving some of the storyline away) split and sissy falls for an ex con with a penchant for abuse and cruelty. she soon realizes that the grass is not always greener on the other side.  how anyone can compare bud to vinnie barbirino is shocking to me. john travolta gave an exceptional performance that was worthy recognition. he was believable and real. the scene where he shaves his beard and you first see him at the bar..still gives me goosebumps. mind you i am not a huge travolta fan, but come on, i see why sissy was kicking of her boots so early in the film. deb winger was so real that you found yourself sympathizing with her as she pens a note of emotions to bud, after sneaking in to clean his house during their break up.   the supporting cast was incredible. wes played by scott glenn gave a first rate performance that made you hate him and curse him as he abused sissy. madolyn smith-osborne, as buds mistress/girlfriend was so authentic that large chested girls across the u.s. prayed to wake up flat chested to wear the clothes she donned in the film. my biggest kudos's go to barry corbin and brooke anderson as bud's aunt and uncle. they seemed like someone's aunt and uncle somewhere in texas and however small their role, they made the film so much bigger and lifelike. two memorable scenes were the dolly parton contest and the unforgettable scene where bud and his aunt stand outside after one of the characters death. the dialog between them is touching.  if you can watch this for what it is, a true american love story. then i recommend that you take it for what it is...a film before it's time that gave us voyeurism into a world unlike our own but real enough for our enjoyment and entertainment. if this world sounds similar to yours then you will enjoy it so much more. lastly, the music however dated, is sure to send you back in time if you are over 30 years of age.",1

"i loved so much about this movie...the time taken to develop the characters, the attention to detail, the superb performances, the stunning lighting and cinematography, the wonderful soundtrack...  it has a combined intensity and lightness of touch that won't work for anyone who wants the typical fast-paced action flick. if we lived in elizabethan days, i'd say this movie's a bit like a shakespearean tragedy. but since we don't, let's say it's more like a drama-suspense movie.  the plot is simple, but the story is complex. the movie is intelligent in the way relationships and issues are explored. much of the story is shown rather than told, which i find makes it more subtle and moving - and which also works well for a story based on a comic book (or graphic novel). at times i felt i was actually there in the 1930s, part of this story - there was such a realistic yet dream-like quality in the style of its telling.  i don't often prefer movies to the books they were based upon, but in this case i do. (though i did enjoy the book too.) i've bought the dvd, which is great because it has some wonderful deleted scenes and insightful commentary.  (i also took my little cousin, who's a little younger than the boy in the movie, to see it after i saw it for the first time, because he has issues at home and i wanted to use this as a way of starting a discussion on father-son issues with him. he loved it - and the discussion.)",1
"first of all, in defense of joan fontaine, it must be said that ginger rogers would have been terribly miscast as alyce, the young british lady who has the title role. fontaine makes a fetching picture as the heroine here, but her acting inexperience shows badly and her dancing is better left unmentioned. fortunately, she went on to better things.  but here it's fred astaire, george burns and gracie allen who get the top billing--and they are excellent. fans of burns & allen will be surprised at how easily they fit into astaire's dance routines. especially interesting is the big fun house routine that won choreographer hermes pans an oscar. they join astaire in what has to be the film's most inventive highlight.  unfortunately, not much can be said for the slow pacing of the story--nor some of the stale situations which call for a lot of patience from the viewer. it must be said that some of the humor falls flat and the usual romantic misunderstandings that occur in any fred astaire film of this period are given conventional treatment. only the musical interludes give the story the lift it needs.  some pleasant gershwin tunes pop up once in awhile but not all of them get the treatment they deserve. the nice supporting cast includes reginald gardiner, at his best in a polished comic performance as a conniving servant, constance collier and montagu love (as joan's father mistaken as a gardener by astaire).  it's a lighthearted romp whenever burns & allen are around to remind us how funny they were in their radio and television days. both of them are surprisingly adept in keeping up with astaire's footwork.  director george stevens makes sure that joan fontaine's hillside dance number with fred is filmed at a discreet distance but clever camera-work cannot disguise the fact that she is out of her element as astaire's dance partner, something she seems painfully aware of.",1

'but there are already far too many csi clones out there, what can we do to make ours stand out?' a naive junior enquires and is sacked instantly. 'stand out! if we do that people may be confused! let's give them more of what they already like!' the big chief screams.   'let's just add more violence and make it really grisly, we are fox after all,' another suit suggests to a hearty reply of 'now you're getting it', from the big chief. 'we could make them the deviant crimes unit,' he goes on to add, clearly on a roll.   'by jove, he's got it!' the big chief laughs, 'and the victims could be beautiful and vulnerable women who wear very little on screen.' 'well that would certainly distract people from the average acting and poor scripts,' blandman points out.   'then it's settled, we just need a name,' the big chief announces. 'we could call it sex cops violence?'   'too literal, how about killer instinctit conveys violence, but sounds a bit like basic instinct which had lots of sex.'   'puuurfect', the big chief replies and then they all slap each other on the back and go and cancel arrested development.",0
"a woman asks for advice on the road to reach a mysterious town, and hears two ghoulish stories from the local weirdo, both zombie related. but perhaps fate has something nasty in store for her too...  the zombie chronicles is absolutely one of the worst films i have ever seen. in fact i must confess, so bad was it i fast forwarded through most of the garbage. and there was a lot of that, believe me. it runs for just 69 minutes, and there is still tons of filler. you get some skinhead doing a lot of push ups, plenty of dull kissy-kissy scenes between goofy teens (that rhymed, tee hee) and some fine examples of why some people should never become actors.  as for the title characters, they barely even have a footnote in the film. why, you get more undead action in the intro than you do the preceding feature! though, considering how pathetic the eyes bursting out of sockets and the eating of brains sequences are (amongst other 'delights'), maybe that's a blessing in disguise.  and to top it all off, it looks likes it's been filmed on someone's mobile phone for broadcast on youtube. jerky camera-work, scratches on the print, flickering lights... i had to rub my eyes when i realised it was made in 2001, and not 1971. even the clothes and fashioned look about three decades out of date!  if you think i'm not qualified to do a review of chronicles having not seen the whole film, then go ahead. you try sitting through it, i betcha you won't even make it to the first appearance of the blue-smartie coloured freaks before making your excuses and leaving. it is truly laughable that anyone chose to release it, and honestly you'll get far more fun resting your drink on the disc than actually torturing your dvd player with this gigglesome excuse for horror. in fact, don't for surprised if it packs it's bags and leaves in the morning, leaving you doomed to watch vhs tapes for the rest of your life. you have been warned... 0/10  p.s what kind of 18-rated horror has the woman keep a massive sports bra on during the obligatory sex scene?! see, the movie can't even get that part right...",0
"i was lucky enough to get a free pass to an advance screening of 'scoop' last night. full house at the theatre and when the movie ended there was spontaneous applause. i didn't speak to anyone who disliked 'scoop' although two teenagers sitting next to me sighed and fidgeted uncomfortably for most of the film. they were the exception though because everyone else including myself really enjoyed themselves.  'scoop' is a quickly paced murder mystery. a young female journalism student is unwittingly maneuvered by forces beyond her control into trying to catch a serial killer on the loose. plenty of hijinks ensue as she partners up with a traveling illusionist and falls in love with a frisky and charming young nobleman.  'scoop' isn't a bad addition to the woody allen filmography. it isn't his best work but it is a very enjoyable and light hearted romp. i'd say it fits quite comfortably into being an average woody allen film, right in the middle of the pack. if you're a woody allen fan you'll probably enjoy yourself. if you're indifferent to his work then 'scoop' might be enough to get you interested in seeing more. i don't think that anyone who dislikes his style of film-making and acting are going to change their mind. woody plays the same kind of neurotic character we've grown so accustomed to although it borders dangerously close to forced and over the top in this film. while potentially aggravating for some who might find themselves wishing he'd hurry up and just spit out the words, woody allen fans know what to expect.  very good performances all around in my opinion although i found myself missing ian mcshane who is excellent and not on camera nearly enough. hugh jackman is great as the charming nobleman and i think woody allen has found a new regular star to work with in scarlett johansson. i think that with 'match point' this is their second pairing and she's just magic with the material that woody gives her. could be the beginning of a beautiful relationship! i'm glad i saw the movie and definitely recommend it. more sophisticated comedy than movies like 'scary movie 4' so if your brand of comedy is the latter rather than the former, 'scoop' probably isn't for you. if, on the other hand, you like a touch of class, sophistication and fun, 'scoop' is for you. probably not the woody allen film i'd introduce to a newcomer but all others should give it a try.",1
"i despise horror movies, that is no secret. no plot, bad acting and gallons of blood are staples of these mistakes of cinema, and this ""movie"" is no exception. i cannot believe some cable stations actually run this garbage. (this particular garbage was released straight-to-video, as i recall.) as mentioning any other movie would be a great insult to that other movie, i say this: all of the phantasm movies, all of the jason movies, freddy movies, chucky movies, and most of the michael myers movies can be summed up in one word: terrible!!!  rating (phantasm iii): 0.5/10",0
"next to the slasher films of the 1970s and 80s, ones about the walking dead were probably the second most popular horror sub-genre. while slasher films had 'black christmas' and 'halloween' to get the whole thing going, zombie flicks had george romero's 'dead' films. and unsurprisingly soon after the success of his first two in the series, other directors wanted to cash in. a lot of italian directors were especially interested, such as lucio fulci who brought us 'zombie' a year after romero's 'dawn of the dead', known as 'zombi' in italy and some other countries, and it was there that fulci's film was known as 'zombi 2'. apart from the walking dead it has no relation to romero's film, but is a good film in it's own right. it was a big success in europe and 9 years later a sequel was born.  pros: lots of beautiful, lush scenery. awesome score. the acting isn't exactly good, but the cast is game and seem to be enjoying the experience. after kind of a slow start, the pace moves along like that of an action flick. plenty cheese and unintentional hilarity for bad film lovers. good job on the make-up effects. lots of blood and some decent gore.  cons: virtually plot less. nothing you haven't already seen before. blatantly rips off some things from the first couple of 'return of the living dead' films. cardboard characters. hasn't aged too well due to the bad 1980s rock music(not that i'm saying all rock music of that period is bad), clothing, and overall feel of the movie.  final thoughts: first of all, this is not a true sequel to fulci's cult classic. in fact, i don't know if it was ever meant to pick up where that film left off. for those that don't know, fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced with bruno mattei. mattei's films are pretty laughable, but like this film many are good campy fun. and that's all this film really is, just something to watch for fun.  my rating: 3.5/5 (so-bad-it's-good rating) 2/5 (serious rating)",0
"if you enjoy seeing what must have started as a 2 hour movie in unconnected bursts of unwatchability, you'll love this film. otherwise, you'll just wonder how they could have made such a film from something so simple to translate to the big screen as inspector gadget.  in the previews for the film, many scenes were shown which were not in the film, and within the film, some scenes just don't make sense. while the movie is slightly less than 1 hour and a half, i can only think of one truly memorable moment, and that is just before or during the credits!

"it ran 8 seasons, but it's first, in early 1959, and it's last, in the autumn of 1965, were shorter than seasons 2-7. cbs chief william paley canceled rawhide's production after watching the 1st show of season 8, in september, 1965, because he disliked the series without eric fleming as gil favor, who had departed after season 7. the last new episode aired in november, 1965. the lone 1966 cbs broadcast, on january 4, 1966, was a rerun.   i have often wondered why rawhide didn't switch to color filming for it's last season? most of the big westerns of the 1960s had gone over to color by 1965. cbs was broadcasting in color that autumn, for many of their sitcoms, but westerns like gunsmoke and rawhide remained in black and white. gunsmoke was the last western (and last prime time network series to switch to color) on september 17, 1966, for the episode snap decision.",1

this movie was bad from the start. the only purpose of the movie was that angela wanted to get a high body count. the acting was horrible. the killings were acted out very badly. like when ally got stuffed down that toilet i guess it was in the abandoned cabin. but when the end of the movie comes and molly and the other guy are in the cabin you see ally so angela must have gone in to get her. the part that really got me was when the black girl and angela were in the cabin and angela took the guitar string and chocked her. one it was horrible acting and two why wouldn't you just turn around and punch the bitch?!?!? then when molly is getting chased by angela if you have the neigh why not just turn around and stab her??? so stupid. this movie sucked...,0
"'they all laughed' is a superb peter bogdanovich that is finally getting the recognition it deserves, and why? their are many reasons the fact that it's set in new york which truly sets the tone, the fantastic soundtrack, the appealing star turns from ben gazzara, and the late john ritter who is superb. and of course no classic is complete without audrey hepburn. the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties, film is essentially about the odyssey detective agency which is run by gazzara who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric blaine novak(the films co-producer) and john ritter, basically the gazzara falls for a rich tycoon magnate's wife(hepburn) and ritter falls for beautiful dorothy stratten who sadly murdered infamously after production, 'they all laughed is essential viewing for bogdanovich fans.",1
"hawked as the most offensive movie ever, guaranteed to offend everyone- guess what? it worked, i'm offended that we shelled out money to rent this. two friends and i were bored and decided to see if all that bull about the movie that we saw on tv was true. curse comedy central and all the other networks that pushed this garbage on us! it was by far the worst movie i've seen since hollow man. i generally avoid the crappy ones, but got sucked into this one. we have since beaten the prick who suggest we rent it, and his movie picking privileges have been revoked. there is nothing remotely funny about this movie...even the ""adventures of dickman"" scene was sophomoric at best.. color me p***ed. thought maybe the production value was crap for some important reason...no..it just sucked. never watch this! for any reason whatsoever. not even with copious amounts of illegal substance would this movie be funny. that's saying alot. please for the love of all that is holy, if you cherish your sanity- never view this movie. it's many things- stupid, pointless, and worthless to name a few. but the main thing it was aiming for: offensively funny- it failed miserably. crash and burn....",0
"i just got this video used and i was watching it last night. the acting started out extremely bad (hey------hey------twister) but got very good soon after wards. the tornadoes looked extremely fake, and many of the cgi effects were very dodgy, but the scene with the house cracking apart and the contents inside being blown around and sucked out were extremely well done, and just about on par with movies like twister. the scenes of devastation were also extremely well done too. the story was very well written, and it's refreshing to see a movie like this stray away from the same old ""disaster formulas"" movies of this genre seems to have been stuck in for 30 years.  while this movie had a very weird mix of fx and acting quality, this merits an a in my book.",1
"this is one of the greatest films i have ever seen: i glowed inside throughout the whole film. the music and cinematography held the spell when little was happening on screen. the slow pace was set by the mode of travel (a riding lawn mower with a big trailer) and was maintained by the background sights and sounds and the slow-paced lives of the other characters.  the story actually happened; alvin straight died in 1996 at the age of 76. there was no acting; everything was completely real, as if the actors had actually transformed into the characters. sissy spacek gave a poignant performance as a somewhat disabled daughter who had suffered much but forged ahead, always wanting to do the right thing. richard farnsworth was cast perfectly and he beautifully became alvin straight, a stubborn but loving elderly man who treks across iowa to visit his estranged brother, lyle, who has had a stroke. alvin had learned much wisdom during his life and that seemed to bring out the best in the people that he encountered along the way.  the film underscores the importance of family to this man and, hopefully, to all of us. i eagerly anticipate seeing it again, and again. directed by david lynch, this films proves his directorial skill. farnsworth was nominated for an academy award for best actor; at 79, he was the oldest nominee ever for that award.",1
"i had read a few positive reviews of this film, and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was. positioned as some cross between an aids-related story and some kind of ""ghost""/""blithe spirit"" tale, this film can't always make it's mind up what it wants to be.   simon and mark are a gay couple who have an ""open"" relationship - simon is able to have anonymous (though safe) sex on the side when he wants. mark is hiv+ and he and simon don't seem to have a sex life anymore. when mark dies, simon - who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father - tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor. not that his behavior before mark's death was much different. but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts, while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings.  unfortunately, simon is such a selfish sob, it's impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film. by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic, it's too late to care. mark, on the other hand, follows in demi moore's footsteps from ""ghost,"" by crying profusely throughout the movie.   there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns. suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor, a la the tv show ""bewitched."" but that doesn't last long. once simon's emotional health is at stake, the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish, with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings. the finale, with a gold-plated muscle-boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened, grief-stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying, chiefly because it isn't intentionally funny.",0
"this movie represents the times it was made in as much as the original, i suppose. which is really sad, because at a deeper level, the title 'vanishing point' the original, is so ironic. i'm sure it wasn't intended that way, but the original was filmed in 1970, and released in 1971. the real 'vanishing point' was the end of an era, which pretty much ended in the early 1970s.   in this remake, all the counter-cultural elements have been stripped away, and been rendered more pc in an attempt to reach a broader audience, presumably. ""sanitized for your protection""   inserting the american indian scenes was gratuitous, and the idea of a 'noble purpose' to the trip was subtraction by addition. i'm glad i watched it however, it made me appreciate the original that much more. the original is a cult classic and golden. this remake is dreadful.",0
"i absolutely fail to see what is funny in this film. the humor seems to be destined for corpses. it's slow. the story is too simple to be true. the characters do not raise much sympathy, a few non-important characters aside. nothing surprising happens. what did the writers of this script think? ""oooo funny! let's make some old lady's high on pot! let's make them.... giggle! let's make them... behave like little children!! oooo, yes, that's absolutely brilliant and original!""  this film has irritated me most from all the films i've seen in the last five years.",0
"well i watched this last night and the one thing that didn't make it completely terrible is that it was straight forward. there was no beating around the bush that this kid was the anti-christ. however the movie was just poorly written. for example, they never explained how they made the dentist incident an ""accident"" or at the end how the cop just miraculously ended up at the house in time to save the kid without the police even being called yet. the death scenes were just really bad and not entertaining at all. the kid they chose to play the anti-christ was boring and they really could've picked a better kid. just don't waste your time watching this.",0
"for the life of me, i cannot get why they would want to make a movie about the ""jerry springer show"". it's so incrediably trashy. some ways, sadly it's a guilty pleasure. we all have to admit that we've seen at least one episode. it's part of our pop culture. i saw this on usa recently. it's pretty bad. i will admit that. jerry does a horrible job of what i think he meant as acting. or something like it. jamie pressley is in it. she's playing herself basically. all she needed was her lover boy, kid rock. it would've been perfect then. so, i would recommend skipping ""ringmaster"". just watch the ""jerry springer show"". it's more enjoyable than this.  2/10",0
"i remember liking this more than nausicaa of the valley of the winds at an age when that tone of story was too serious for me. laputa, whose title seems to have affected its release in the u.s. to avoid confusion to its wide hispanic audiences, has the cartoonish knack of the director's debut production conan. in fact, pazu has the thick bones and immortal vitality of conan--who jumped off a thousand stories carrying his girl in his arms and landed on his feet, then started running. this makes him the most animated and pleasing character to watch. the techie fans of nausica may be disappointed by the flying bugs and the retro technology through out laputa--the only exception may be the robot. unlike princess mononoke and valley of the winds, the theme in laputa is not directly connected to environmentalism. if it has a theme at all it's anti-warfare. the importance of living naturally--this is related with the flying castle, is dismissably shortly discussed, and not really followed through. overall, i now regard the piece as being at an intersection between feel-good and corny.",1

"a surprise thriller with more twists and double crosses than a doodle pad. a great cast mixing it up with an intriguing plot overseen by a twin peaks-ish influence in director dahl. nicholas cage is a very underrated actor and shows a great portrayal of a man in a bind looking for the right thing to do. j.t. walsh (rip to a great actor) is always a wonderful villain, as is dennis hopper. it's such a shame he never made to a higher profile in the biz. i'm sure he has his followers, though. in all, this is a great film that shows you that you don't need big bangs or a commercial soundtrack to be an entertaining film.",1
"i must admit that this is the type of film that i would normally eschew, but i rented it basically because of the stars. i certainly was not sorry. in fact, as you see, i rated it five stars. this film is the perfect combination of sharp directing and superior acting.  andy and hank hanson are brothers who decide to commit the uncouth crime of robbing their parents' jewelry store. the crime goes terribly wrong - thus beginning an examination of the three men in the hanson family. through a series of flashbacks, we get to know charles hanson and come to an understanding of the strained relationship between father and sons.  younger brother, hank is basically a screw-up. he has always had trouble holding a job and pretty much goes in the direction of the wind. hank is insecure, cowardly, and very much under the influence of his big brother. ethan hawke has the character of hank ""nailed to a t"" and gives what is probably his best performance thus far. he shows us a man who is basically good-hearted but so influenced by outside forces that he is unable to follow through with any important task.  andy - on the surface - appears to be a successful businessman, but we soon discover that he is addicted to drugs and has been embezzling from his company to pay for his habit. it is andy who concocts the scheme to rob his parents' store, and he gets weak-willed hank to commit the act. philip seymour hoffman - surely one of the finest actors of our time - plays andy. hoffman is an actor who has the ability to portray a man who, on the surface, is a charming businessman liked by his acquaintances but a real slime ball underneath. he is absolutely perfect for the part of andy or it might be said that he, through his superior acting skills, made andy the perfect part.  albert finney plays a father common to his generation. charles hanson is not a bad or unfeeling man, but he has a lousy relationship with his sons because he never really understood what was necessary in nurturing a positive bond between his sons and himself. he has always been too quick to criticize and admonish. he always made it clear that he favored his younger son over his older thus causing a wide emotional rift between himself and andy. as we get to know charles and andy, the thought of andy forming a plan to rob from his father becomes less unbelievable.  on a personal note, i cannot believe how much charles hanson reminded me of my own father, and how much andy and hank reminded me of my own brother and myself. perhaps this may be one of the reasons that i enjoyed the film so much as this story of a distant, critical father, a more successful older brother, and a less successful younger brother hit so close to home. fortunately, my brother and i never came to the state of committing a crime against my parents- guess we were made of sterner and more moral stuff.  this complex of personalities and actions has been expertly put together by director, sidney lumet. at eighty-three, he still has the chops to give the audience engrossing characters and edge-of-seat action that hypnotizes. 12 angry men was his first film made fifty years prior to before the devil knows you're dead, but he hasn't lost any bit of his magic touch in showing us characters that will be long remembered.  the events and characters in before the devil knows you're dead are harsh and unattractive, and this is definitely not a feel-good movie. however, it is two hours of ultimate entertainment which i thoroughly recommend.",1
"i have a deep liking for this film despite it appearing deliberately less 'polished' than the other fred and ginger films, not to mention the slightly problematic casting of harriet hillard in the lead romantic role.   once again with these films, the plot is of a minor consequence - astaire plays a rather unlikely sailor (who happens to be a brilliant former hoofer (of course!)) and rogers an aspiring performer in a seedy dime-a-dance music hall. although their relationship is bright and fun to watch, they are bogged down by an un-involving main story of hilliard and randolph scott not succeeding in finding any chemistry between them.   although it was a last minute decision, hilliard was rather miscast in this as she doesn't have the screen presence to give this film what it needs despite being sweet and likable throughout. the film may have benefited in promoting lucille ball's wise-cracking worldy brassy character to a larger role as she simply shined in every small scene, and would have made a great helen broderick-type side-kick to rogers in this kind of bright film (see 'stage door', made the following year, for an example of wonderful scenes between these two fantastic actresses). that scott's one-dimensional neanderthal character eventually falls in love with hilliard's is even harder to believe than astaire being in the navy!   now onto the important part, the singing and dancing: nothing more can be said about ""let's face the music and dance"" other than it is brilliant and moving and perfectly executed and i often finish watching that scene with tears in my eyes. however other songs in the film deserve some recognition as well; ""i'm putting all my eggs in one basket"" is a lovely example of the comedic instincts of astaire and rogers, and almost pokes fun at their reputation of bursting into spontaneous, perfectly synchronized dancing. other highlights are ""i'd rather lead the band"" and ""let yourself go"" which show how these two talents could perform as brilliantly alone as together. i nearly forgot to mention that this is one of the few (if not the only) time we see astaire brilliantly play on the piano; it seems this man's talents were endless!  overall, i actually prefer this to 'top hat' and 'swing time' (although only just), as it is more earthy and performed so enthusiastically by all involved, it is hard to dislike the fun factor.",1
"my wife and i both thought this film a watered-down, made-for-tv (bbc) version of manhattan murder mystery...which is itself good, but not great. the story has little inter- character tension or chemistry, and not much of a plot. woody allen's character just sort of wanders around running off at the mouth, and hugh jackman and scarlett johannsson don't have a lot more to do. it's pretty disappointing, i must say. ian mcshane's role is just an expanded cameo appearance.   the first thing that occurred to me was ""i wonder how much the bbc had to pay woody allen to dislodge him from manhatttan?"" he must've needed the money, and they must have needed his appeal to expand their audience beyond the youth market drawn to the two stars. i'm giving this movie 4 stars instead of 3 because it is unbothersome background noise. if you ever want something to have on while you're knitting or sorting your stamp collection, this'll do the job. i wouldn't pay to rent it again.",0
"well i have to say that i have waited for it to come.  i won't try to spoil it and quite a few people have really brilliantly spoken of the pilot. on the other hand i'm not quite sure to understand the detractors who claim themselves to be bsg fans and not like the pilot.  what the frack did they expect?!! the background is setting 50 years before bsg we are there o assist at the birth of the cylons, see the life of the adama family (has we already knew some of it from bsg), get a deeper explanation of the caprican population and its perception of the other colonies, and potentially the origins of the gods belief of the human and the unique god belief of the cylons.   i do not expect the same profusion of special effect or space opera as the in the previous series, i make the difference between the two although i know that caprica will reinforce bsg.  this is 1h30 of promising start, i believe as well that this will put pressure for the scenarios to be as good as bsg. i expect a lot from the following but i have no reasons to doubts that we will learn a lot more.  watching the dvd's deleted scene also gives more material for your brain to chew on.  looking forward to january 2010",1
"this film was really eye-opening. i have seen this film several times. first, when i was four and i actually remembered it and then when i was 12. the whole message that the director is conveying is for everyone to wake up and not make the mistake of leaving god out of our everyday lives or just plain going the extra mile to insult him.  a great movie for non-believers and believers alike!",1
"rko had a reputation for making folksy, homespun pieces of americana.  anne shirley (as dawn o'day) had been in films since she was a toddler. by 1933 she was in limbo - having played ann dvorak as a child in ""three on a match"" (1932) and a ""flower girl"" in both ""this side of heaven"" and ""the key"" both in 1934. george nicholls jnr remembered anne's work from a previous film and that's how she got this part. she also adopted anne shirley as her stage name. the memorable stories are there - lady of shallot in a leaky boat, the ""stolen"" brooch, the ""red hair"" incident. anne was so right for the role of the chatty, heartwarming orphan. she was heartbreaking in her intensity, her eagerness to please and also her fiery temper. o.p. heggie was wonderful as the understanding matthew cuthbert and helen westley was fine as the firm marilla. tom brown was an excellent gilbert blythe. gertrude messinger, who had also been in films as a small child was fine as diana barry. sara haden proved she could play someone other than aunt millie in the andy hardy series, was mrs. barry.",1

"oh dear god. this was horrible. there is bad, then there was this. this movie makes no sense at all. it runs all over the map and isn't clear about what its saying at all. the music seemed like it was trying to be like batman. the fact that 'edison' isn't a real city, takes away. since i live in vancouver, watching this movie and recognizing all these places made it unbearable. why didn't they make it a real city? the only writing that was decent was'tilman' in which john heard did a fantastic job. he was the only actor who played his role realistically and not over the top and campy. it was actually a shame to see john heard play such a great bad guy with a lot of screen time, and the movie be a washout. too bad. hopefully someone important will see it, and at least give john heard credit where credit is due, and hire him as lead bad guy again, which is where he should be. on the a list.",0
"only reason i have seen 101 dalmatians was its nominations for original song and costume design for the oscars. i must admit that i was less than impressed with this film. in this sequel, cruella devil(by the way glen close pulls off this role very well) is released from the hospital due to her good behaviour. she likes all sort of animals and locks all her furs away. from that point, we only wait until she starts having crises. soon enough, she does and tries to make the best coat of fashion world, of course for herself and from fine dalmatian fur. apart from glen close, i found all cast quite silly but from a child's eye funny. that is fair enough as its target market is, i assume, children under 12. quite a good entertainment for children and families, but didn't do much for me. * out of *****",0
"there are three kinds of bad films - the cheap, the boring, and the tasteless. the only really bad movies are boring and tasteless.   boring films are just, well, boring - if you don't leave quickly enough, you fall asleep.  tasteless films actually have their defenders; but the fact remains that they are masturbatory aids for very sick people.  only the cheap bad films are really funny, because the filmmakers wanted to make their films so desperately, they way-over-reached beyond their abilities and available resources.  bo derek is just naturally boring and tasteless; fortunately, fate and a lack of funds and skill redeem her by making her seem cheap as well. this film is hilarious and it may well be the last really funny-bad film ever made.  i first saw this in a theater, may god forgive me; i was laughing so hard i was rolling off my seat, and so too with most of the rest of the audience.  it's clear that derek and her husband-promoter, conceived of this film as, partly, a satire; unfortunately, the dereks clearly lacked any of the necessary resources to pull that off; consequently, the 'satirical' element comes off as some school-girl's impression of some gay young man's impression of frank gorshin's impression of the riddler in batman trying to pretend he's robin - it doesn't fly over our heads, it has no clue where any human head might be.  on the other hand, there are some supposedly serious moments in this film - it is supposed to be an action film, remember - that are so astoundingly cheesy, one wonders if someone squirted spoiled milk in one's eye.  as for derek's infamous tendency to reveal her breasts - i can't imagine a less erotic nudity photographic display, she is so weird looking with those broad shoulders, i can't imagine what any one ever saw in her.  as for the plot - such as it is - well, it isn't; derek chases around africa, and god alone knows why. then her father - harris - pretends to act in some maniacal puppet-show, and then of course there's the hunk'o'tarzan that seems to have wondered in from advertisement without knowing that the subject's changed - probably because he hasn't seen a script - apparently no one has.  negligible camera work, shoddy editing - if it weren't for the 3-way with the chimp, the film would be unbearable -  as it is, it's a real hoot.",0
"this is going to be the most useless comment i have ever put down, but yet i must do it to warn you about the atrocity to cinema that ""freddy's dead"" is. it is not only the very worst chapter of the nightmare series, but is right up there with the worst horror sequel of all time! it was boring, pointless, and nearly death free. the horrible 3-d ending and over-the-top corny kills are enough to drive this ""film"" into the ground. however, it doesn't stop there, just add bad acting, a terrible script, and a number of cheesy cameos and you've got yourself this heaping pile of guano! it's no wonder why freddy, as always played by robert englund, has made two postmortem appearances. i would too if i went out like that. this is a strictly fans only movie, don't stare at our shame.",0
"i usually like comedy movies. i really enjoy them. but i don't really get the point of ""envy"". i mean, it has a dull content/topic, and it's not really funny.  although the acting is generally good, it's not enough for the movie to get at least a bit interesting. stiller and black don't show all their talent in this movie.  so, if you're about to rent a comedy, i suggest you definitely don't go for this one. unless you want to get bored, and i can see i'm not the only one with this opinion, because even jack black apologized for it (take a look at trivia).",0
"the vampire bat is set in the small german village of klineschloss where gustave schoen (lionel belmore) the burgermeister is holding a meeting with inspector karl brettschneider (melvyn douglas) from the local constabulary about all the recent murders, six victims have been discovered in as many weeks all drained of blood & bearing the same two puncture wounds on their necks. brettschneider doesn't have a single clue but the superstitious elders of the village believe the deaths to be the work of a vampire. brettschneider isn't convinced but the scared villagers keep telling tales of seeing a large bat, meanwhile the latest victim martha mueller (rita carlyle) has been found. brettschneider comes under increasing pressure to solve the murders but can he really believe that a giant vampire bat is responsible & if it is how's he going to stop it?  directed by frank r. strayer the vampire bat was a cheapie from majestic pictures to cash in on the success of it's two stars atwill & wray & their success in the previous years doctor x (1932) & is more of a murder mystery rather than a horror as the exploitative & enticing title may have lead you to believe & quite frankly it's rather dull. the script by edward t. lowe jr. takes itself rather seriously & sets up the basic story that something is killing local villagers & that something could possibly be a vampire, then for most of it's duration the film focuses on brettschneider & his incompetent investigations which are, not to put too fine a point on it, boring. the vampire bat also has a bit of an identity crisis as it doesn't quite know what it wants to be, the title would suggest a horror film while the majority of it could easily be described as a thriller with the final few minutes descending into silly sci-fi. there is no vampire bat, the attempts to fool you are pathetic, all the character's are broad stereotypes & you can tell the villain of the piece straight away & as a whole there is nothing particularly exciting or entertaining about the vampire bat. i know it's old but that's not an excuse as cinema has moved on a lot since 1933 & a bland, flat, dull, boring & misleading film such as the vampire bat just doesn't cut it these days, just look at the original king kong (1933) released the same year & how brilliantly that still holds up today. i didn't like it & i doubt many modern film-goers would either, it's as simple & straight forward as that.  director strayer doesn't do anything special but this is a case in point where i can cut the film some slack because of it's age, as a whole it's pretty much point, shoot & hope for the best stuff. there isn't much in the way of atmosphere or scares although some of the sets which were already existing ones taken from the old dark house (1932) & universal's european set on their back-lot are nice & add a certain ambiance to things.  technically the vampire bat can't compare to anything even remotely modern, for the age of it it's alright i suppose but again i draw your attention back to the original king kong. speaking of king kong it's star fay wray has a role in this as does horror icon lionel atwill, i'll be kind & say the acting is ok.  the vampire bat will i imagine fool a lot of people into thinking that it's a horror film about vampire bats when in fact it isn't, personally i thought the whole thing was a bit of a bore. it's short & it tells it's story reasonably enough but i must admit i'm not a fan.",0
"well, the big money machine has done it again! disney very shrewdly takes advantage of morons like myself who feel we must own every video (good or bad) stamped with the disney moniker. why is it that i continue to look forward to these ""sequels"" which make don bluth on a bad day look like leonardo davinci? cinderella 2 consists of three storylines (already a poor choice!) doesn't one of the most endearing disney creations at least deserve a linear story? of these three, only the last comes anywhere near the quality of animation and storytelling that i would expect. the music is atrocious and modern (meaning in 2 years it will already be dated) and adds nothing to the story. why does everything have to be updated? you know, the original cartoon is still popular because of its timelessness, so why not be respectful and true to the original with songs that reflect the same style? gee, i can't wait for a sequel to sleeping beauty. instead of music based on the themes of tchaikovsky, we'll get music inspired by britney spears!!! so disney, if you're listening, remember we're not all indiscriminate children out here. how about throwing a bone or two to the fans who've been around long enough to know the difference between craft and crap?",0
"any film that deals with bigotry in a positive manner is a film that should still be seen by current audiences as the message and moral of the story will always be relevant as long as we have a world full of bigotry.  aside from that, the film is really an old-fashioned love story..boy meets girl..boys loses girl...boy gets girl back....  the weakest role goes to the late kent smith as lt. general webster(riccardo montalban is a close second)...my question would be how did he ever get to be a 3-star general...the character is such a wimp in the presence of his wife and military subordinates, it's a wonder they show him any respect at all.  brando's southern accent is a little overdone, and some scenes have a few holes but overall, i enjoy the film every time i see it.  red buttons is great...i always love seeing comedians in dramatic roles...as in button's case, often a comedian can better portray the tragedy of a person than a more traditional dramatic actor.",1
"if you like animal movies, this movie will please. my wife likes animals and animal movies, she especially like the parrot in this film. it is geared towards kids, but i laughed at most of the humor. the french fashion character made me laugh, and adds balance to the script. it is a disney film, with its sappy, happily, family apeal, but i like leaving the theater with a positive fealing.",1
"it's amazing that actress p.j. soles didn't become a big star after playing riff randall, #1 fan of the punk rock group the ramones, in ""rock 'n' roll high school"". soles is so exuberant, you don't mind she's obviously too old to still be in high school (that fact is leveled out by having all the kids look 24). the movie is a fast-paced frolic that doesn't cop-out; everything gets blown to smithereens at the end, and that's just as it should be. mary woronov, an innately kinky and funny presence as the nazi-like principal, gets a great, one-of-a-kind bit at the beginning where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did they use on that, or was it a fluke?) and dey young is very appealing as soles' best, kate rambeau. the weakest link, ironically enough, in this ""high school"" chain-gang is the ramones. they can't act, they're not funny, and their concert segment goes on too long. one ramones song, ""i want you around"", is treated as a fantasy and is well captured; other incidental songs are good, particularly a rare paul mccartney ballad heard near the beginning (""did we meet somewhere before?""). great fun! *** from ****",1
"the subject notwithstanding, this is an amateur, exhibitionist movie--or an effort at one--which is about as interesting and daring as a moody high school student's composition book full of death ""poetry"". to be sure, it will disturb viewers who are hell-bent on being disturbed, but the success will be attributable to themselves, not to the director. to genuinely get under somebody's skin requires sensibility, discipline, technique, and talent, as well as an eye and an ear. the film does contain one evocative image, shown as a still (and also used on the video case), but with no development leading up to or away from it. if the director had had an eye, he would have seen it as a possible starting point for an interesting movie--that is, a movie.",0
"having read diamond's book, i was slightly disappointed in the series, but all in all, it is quite informative. reading the other comments, it is comforting to know that the 'culture warriors' are hard at work, seeing 'attacks' on 'western civilization' under every rug.  is diamond a little preachy ? sure. like a lot of academics, he sees his theory as the most important thing ever. he uses the phrase 'guns, germs, and steel' at seemingly every opportunity during the series. we get it, after about the first 10 minutes.  is diamond a little simplistic (in the series) ? sure. the part about the spaniards in south america is particularly amusing, condensing some very long, complicated history down to 'smallpox, swords, and horses', wrapping up the whole conquest of south america in about 15 minutes. but the point remains valid - these things did in fact contribute (but not totally define) the reasons for the spaniard's success against the established cultures.  is he preaching *against* western civilization in any way ? nope. not a word. not to my ear. all he says is that luck played a large part in determining which cultures advanced more quickly, *not* that luck is the only reason.  in the end, if you're looking for something that validates your own sense of superiority, then this series is not for you. but if you are interested in all of the factors than influence how societies succeed or fail, this series presents a useful interpretation of the historical evidence.",1
"i attended one of the premieres last night and have the following observations:   1. just because you've directed a ton of music videos does not make you qualified to make movies. the movie had an overabundance of lingering shots that made no sense, horrible angles, and terrible lighting. the editing didn't help this mess at all. when ""dixie"" shows up late for the memorial service her mother remarks about her hand but it's never clear what the heck she's talking about.  2. the plot had promise, but the script was thin and full of ford truck sized holes. we never get to understand what drives the characters, what's really behind the conflicts they all have with each other or exactly how they resolve them. sixteen years of distance is wiped out in 4 days seemingly by magic. the deep conversations were marred by stupid clichés. (in fact, the whole town was one big cliché of southern life.) half the audience groaned when toby drawled ""ya got my blood runnin through your veins gurl""...and we were treated to that insipid line not once, but twice! the revelations were yawn inducing, and the dramatic confessions boiled down to ""i was stupid and stubborn"".  3. the acting was okay considering the wreck of a script they had to work with. toby was dark and brooding most of the film, but when he smiled and lightened up he was charming. it's a shame he didn't have more screen time like that. kelly preston's acting chops are pretty rusty and it shows. lindsay haun is talented and it's certainly not her fault the writers made her character so unlikeable in the beginning that you don't blame her father for not coming to look for her. burt reynolds and tess harper were able to make more of this movie but still looked more or less lost. (and indeed, their characters get lost in this film!)   4. if you're a toby fan you'll love the songs. but often the movie felt like a scene was forced in just so they could feature one of his songs--or the artists on his record label. for instance, the movie's official love song is ""crash here tonight"". you'd think that would play around a tender love scene, but nope...we hear about 45 seconds of it as he's heading to a memorial service. it was as if they said ""well, we gotta use this song somewhere"". the song ""broken"" is haunting and the best thing to come out of this movie.  in summary...a promising plot never fully develops and the movie is horribly uneven as it forceably tries to be a vehicle for toby keith's music and product placement for ford trucks. it goes from being about people rebuilding broken bridges to trying to be about the power of music but the story is told so poorly that both points get lost in this overgrown music video. i like toby and really wanted to like ""broken bridges"" but the people he counted on to make this movie let him down and deserve one of his famous boots you know where.",0
"watching josh kornbluth 'act' in this movie reminds me of my freshman tv production class, where the 'not funny' had the chance to prove just how unfunny they really were!  obvious is the word that comes to mind when i try to synopsize this wannabe comedy. the jokes are sophomoric and telegraphed. the delivery is painfully bad. ouch!!!!!!! the writing is simply dorkish. it is akin to a bob saget show.   watching this movie is as painful as watching a one and a half hour long saturday night live skit (post belushi).   i hated this movie and want my money back!!!",0
"this isn't masterpiece theater. you shouldn't go into it expecting that. this is pure girl fun with the most fantastic cast of female leads. like someone else here said, this is the film baby mama was meant to be. and the only downside i see to this film is that tina fey was not in it- besides that it stars the smartest and brightest girls on the planet. the film is pure silliness on the surface, but if you really watch you will know it has a lot of messages and deep meaning to any of us who wish they could go back and do it all over again in life knowing then what we know now. pure fun and i recommend it to anyone looking for 84 minutes of great escape.",1

"the late 30s and early 40s were a golden age for adventure movies, what with the rise in budgets during the economic recovery, the changes to screen entertainment since the production code became enforced and the general carefree optimism of the times. while most of these were rip-roaring swashbucklers about the wild, superhuman and often frankly misogynistic exploits of heartthrobs like errol flynn and tyrone power, gunga din is very different in its focus, scope and tone.  part of gunga din's secret is the division of labour in its writing team. the original story is by ben hecht and charles macarthur, two of the most skilled and celebrated writers of hollywood's golden age. however the actual screenplay was the work of joel sayre and fred guiol, both of whom, guiol especially, had a background in comedy. what we get from these four is a plot that is well-balanced and engaging, yet also cleverly spiced up with comical touches. most of the adventure flicks of this time were at least partly comedies, usually featuring one or two comic-relief supporting players, but they didn't use laughs in the way gunga din does. here, all the main characters are capable of being objects or originators of jokes. we see the sinister menace of the bad guys suddenly diffused as the scene dissolves into a light-hearted brawl. the first main battle scene is an even-handed blend of action and gags, in the style of the silent swashbucklers of douglas fairbanks, sr., something which the flynn and power vehicles largely failed to replicate. towards the middle of gunga din the action must necessarily take a break and there are lots of talky scenes for the sake of the plot. however the continual forays into comedy  such as the spiked punch routine  make this ""slow"" portion bearable.  producer-director george stevens was a natural when it came to this sort of thing, himself having cut his teeth at the hal roach studios, and almost exclusively having directed comedy up to this point. this was his first full-on action feature, and he does a startlingly good job. in particular his use of moving point-of-view shots make the battle scenes extra exhilarating. he also brings something you seldom see in action pictures of this era  a sense of real dread and fear. he sets this up with those stark and foreboding mountains dominating many of the shots and dwarfing the characters. the portrayal of the abandoned village and the thuggee cultists cry of ""kali!"" is genuinely haunting. this dimension of fear plays into all the other emotions that are at work here, causing us to worry for these likable characters, and making the comedy a greater relief of tension.  a real touch of genius is in the way the eponymous hero is introduced to the audience. we are made aware of din visually, as he is prominent in a number of scenes before any of the characters actually address him or verbally refer to him. because of this, we are given the impression that din is not an important figure within the regiment, but he quickly becomes a notable character to us, and crucially a sympathetic one, as we see him risking his life and giving water to dying men.  but the best efforts of writers and directors are all for nought without a capable cast. fear not, for gunga din has a top-notch one! victor mclaglan and cary grant were ideally suited to the material, since their best roles were generally found somewhere on the spectrum between drama and comedy. grant in particular is at his best, largely believable but just occasionally breaking into that over-the-top whooping and capering that was his trademark. douglas fairbanks, jr. is not quite up to the standard of his heavyweight companions, but he is by no means bad. and of course there is sam jaffe, cursed by his looks to forever play these wizened little oddballs, but who else could play them with such dignity and humanity? i have not set out to bash the swashbuckling adventures of errol flynn and tyrone power, and indeed many of their pictures are absolute classics that i love absolutely. but gunga din does things that even the best of those swashbucklers could never achieve. not only does it dispense with the dashing male lead or the clichéd defiant damsel, it successfully merges the action genre with comedy and poignancy, in a way that few pictures have done before or since. and that's fabulous.",1

"there is only one thing essential to thorough appreciation of the indian runner. unzip your trousers. peek inside. is there evidence of a y chromosome? okay, you'll do.  this film has all the male requisites: blood, guns, car chases, fond women, death, multiple tattoos, cigarettes, liquor, violence, pyrotechnics -- what have i left out? -- oh, yeah, blowtorches.  as a woman, i seriously hope sean penn regards this as a `when i was a child...' kind of effort. since he both wrote and directed the thing, he's nearly solely responsible. an uneven cast (viggo mortensen as usual demonstrating brilliantly how the job's supposed to be done) tries to save penn. too late. the lines and action are there. even devoted, skilled acting can't change those.  i found this movie puerile and silly, as well as predictable. the dialogue staggers along -- sandy dennis has my respect for trying to breathe life into a woodenly maternal monologue without motherly authenticity. then she dies. after a bit, so does the protagonists' father, played by charles bronson. their absence is hardly noticeable.  at intervals, the pyrotechnics, etc., noted above appear to liven things up and scare the audience into thinking something significant is occurring.  if you're male and under 25, you may adore this film. plan to return to it at 35. think you'll still like it?  i don't think so.",0

"this movie is horrible if you pay attention to it. it's a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen - each one with no apparent connection to the next. i rented this movie because i'm a david bowie fan, and i really appreciate musicals. in finality, bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired. the moral of the story was really befuddling. i couldn't tell if it was about racial issues in london in the 1950s or about not selling out. for the first half of the movie i was chuckling at how cheesy it was but i liked the campiness of the ""no selling out"" message. when blacks started being murdered i thought my tape had gotten messed up. maybe i rented half of two different movies? nope, there was a ""keep britain white"" song and dance sequence. i'm sorry, but wwii is not something you can write a musical about. at least not a musical that could conceivably be described as ""campy"" as i have several times in this review. overall i'd say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors.

"i tried to like this slasher, like i try to enjoy all slasher films. i mean mindless slaying mixed with a little nudity and some suspense, how can you go wrong. but unhinged i think is an example of that formula going wrong. the main issue is the horrible acting of the main three girls that landed up in the house. it was as if they were under sedation, and it stopped me from ever getting interested in their plight. the film aims for suspense and creepiness but the by the numbers direction saps it of those, and leaves the movie pretty dull. it's a shame, because if the movie was better executed, it would have have been ace. the story and characters are pretty creepy and there are some dark and bizarrely humorous moments of interaction between the mother, the girls, and the daughter in the old house. there's some good nudity, and occasional splashy bloodletting, just not enough to give the film the kick it needed. the finale is pretty twisted and fearsome, and does give the film a big lift but sadly, its too little too late. so, in my opinion, one to avoid, unless you really love obscure slasher films. there's a fair amount of potential, but the film delivers too little to be worthwhile.",0

"i really can't remember who recommended this, but they said it was one of their favorite films. it is certainly a strange one - like rubbernecking at a highway accident.  someone said that truth is stranger than fiction, and the truth here is something to see. i really can't understand how a fictionalized account of this documentary is to be released this year. how can you improve on this? the aunt and cousin of jackie kennedy remove themselves from new york society and hide in the hampton's. in the process they become recluses and what is best described as ""crazy cat ladies."" they would have stayed hidden had not the city move to condemn the property for the filth and the subsequent rescue by jackie. this film was done after that rescue. all during, you couldn't help but think, ""how bad was it before?"" it's a look at high society from the darker side, and it is utterly fascinating.",1

"this film centers on four criminals, locked away in a prison who desire escape from their cell, hoping that a mysterious book of black magic, penned by a former inmate around 1920, named danvers who wanted to use spells to keep his skin young.  carrère's(gérald laroche)criminal business tactics(shortcuts)have landed him in prison with three oddball cell-mates..a transsexual brute marcus(clovis cornillac), marcus' love-toy pâquerette(dimitri rataud)who eats objects he touches(..and is in prison for eating his six-month old sister)and obeys his charge as if ""he"" were his mother, and the scholarly lassalle(philippe laudenbach)who doesn't read, or eat breakfast(..the latter being that he murdered his wife during that time of the day). the film follows carrère as he reads from the book, attempting to understand it's meanings hoping to find an exit from his prison. carrère loves his child, and for a while believes his wife will get him out early on bail. when she betrays him, carrère begins to slowly seethe with hate, and longing to see and hold his beloved son. carrère's toughest critic is marcus, who longs to be fully female, while still folding to several masculine traits, such as working out and taking a leak standing up. he talks tough and uses his muscle as a type of fear tactic, although deep inside is a world of vulnerability. pâquerette is completely under marcus' control and behaves like a canine to it's master..there's even an alarming scene where pâquerette breast-feeds from marcus! lassalle is an unraveling mystery, opening up for us to slowly understand his ulterior motives and what lies within his possibly sinister brain. clearly intellectual, and holding possible secrets from the others, lassalle is actually the one who keeps the motivation of pursuing the secrets of the book going. soon, those who aren't a threat to the book seek their ""true"" escape, not as much from the cell of four walls, but the cell that imprisons their true desires. after a certain murder, the book is thrown from the room with a very fascinating character entering the film with a camcorder as if he were a new occupant..who is this person and how does he understand the power of a book tosses away, and better yet, how to use it? a constant in this film is each of the prisoners often seen throughout looking out their window into the world just out of reach.  i'm glad i had a chance to watch this film. it does play out like ""monkey's paw"", the characters get what they desire, but a price must be met. there's gore in the film, startling moments of graphic violence, but, in my opinion, this is first and foremost a story-driven tale. the gore is a product of what the book unleashes. one of the group gets his limbs twisted while suspended in the air, while a grisly opening act displays the carnage left in the wake of one man's desire. we see danver's fate at the end, with a magnificent special effects sequence regarding an infant melting away. lassalle's fate is a masterful effects sequence. i will say that maléfique, through eric valette's well paced direction, always kept my attention, and, for being such an isolated movie(..about 95 % of the film takes place in a singular location, the prison cell)it never seems to drag. i guess that's a testament to interesting actors and fascinating characterizations, not to mention a compelling story using the supernatural to drive them.",1
"i saw this film 12 years ago on tnt. it was susanah york's birthday and they were showing this film as a double feature with tom jones (1963). i have not seen this film on tv since. i took interest in seeing this film because one of the stars is the very funny and talented jim dale, as lusty the sailor. i believe that dale now does the narration of the harry potter books on casette, but anyway he is quite funny. this is a fast paced comedy. it is not on vhs or dvd. columbia pictures should go through their film collection, and consider restoring and releasing this film to dvd. christopher plummer is hilarious as lord fopington, ian bannen is also quite humorous as ramble the sailor. this is a bawdy comedy, the kind of film one no longer sees, with great production values. ***1/2 stars out of ****",1
"i had some time to kill before watching football so i saw this movie being offered on the scifi channel and it literally after watching it i thought i had encountered my version of mentally walking the bataan death march as my conscious was beaten into submission by the awful movie which ripped off the mummy series and jurassic park. it was so bad that i thought the opening credits were the highlight of the movie and then it went into such a abysmal descent that it made the recent drop in the stock market seem like a hiccup. the acting was so bad that i was hoping that one and all would be buried at the end. the lead by casper van dien made me long for the high caliber acting of steven seagal in ""on deadly ground"" as his line reading was so wooden that woody woodpecker was thinking of making a cameo to sit on his shoulder. i also noticed that his emotional range is so limited that i was under the impression my kitten was more expressive when asking for popcorn to eat . the direction was so abysmal i looked back yearning to my nephew's grade 3 play recital which had more pace and better vision and the fact that this movie seems to be have spliced together from afterthoughts of the aforementioned movie franchise it can not even be thought of as a homage. the fx of the movie was so bad that i thought the director and producers were enviormentally friendly by recycling cheap special effects from grade z horror flicks from yesteryear. what robert wagner, tom bosley and geoffrey lewis were doing in this movies is beyond me and they should look at litigation against their agents for misrepresentation for getting them involved with such a dreck of a movie. my warning to one and all is watch this movie at your peril as this movie may cause your iq to diminish with prolonged viewing. on a side note i noticed at imdb that sometimes salaries for movies are published i was wondering if their is a way that actors that should give the salaries back for their poor performances in such movies. beware and be safe avoid at all costs.",0
"this cecil b. demille epic of the old west contains what may be jean arthur's finest performance, as a hysterical, eccentric, incurably amoral, but devotedly doting calamity jane. she really pulled it off! gary cooper is at his most taciturn, but manages some occasional pithy sayings: 'the plains are big, but trails cross ... sometimes.' the story is a pastiche to end all pastiches. all the cowboy heroes of western lore seem to be in there somehow except for jesse james. even abraham lincoln opens the story in person (or at least, demille would have us believe so). there is no room for anything so evanescent as subtlety, this is a 'stomp 'em in the face' tale for the masses. a remarkable thing about this film however is that it is a very early full frontal attack on what eisenhower was eventually to name 'the military industrial complex'. it isn't just a story about gun-runners, but about arming anyone for money, and doing so from the heart of washington. but let's not get into politics, let's leave that to demille, who can be guaranteed to be superficial. the chief interest of this film all these years later is that it uses the first film score composed by george antheil, who has a lot to say about the job in his autobiography, 'bad boy of music'. antheil seems to have originated 'the big sound' adopted by all subsequent westerns, whereby the plains sing out with the voices and sounds of countless cowboys in the sky, celebrating the open spaces and interweaving common melodies. that is why it does not sound at all unusual, because we have heard it a thousand times. but he seems to have been the first to summon up the combined rustlings of all the sage brush into this symphony of the open skies which has entered into american mythic lore, and given it a soundtrack which has never varied since then, corny as it may be, but doubtless appropriate. it is amusing to see anthony quinn in an early appearance as a cheyenne indian. gabby hayes is in there somewhere, but you miss him in the crowd. gary cooper overtops them all, looming large, - but when did he ever loom small?",1

"my one line summary should explain it all, but i'll have a go at it.  from the get-go, this movie seemed like an overdone soap opera, and that's about all i can comment on. there were a few interesting scenes, such as the ""big one"" that hit during the middle of the movie, but, wait, what's that? the earthquake *gasp*, wait a minute! that's dante's peak! well, parts of it butchered and slapped in. i can't believe how poorly this movie was done, ""borrowing"" scenes from other, much better films. one wonders what director thought that viewers are dumb enough to believe large wooded mountain-esque backdrops exist in downtown la, ala dante's peak.  my advise, forget the bond wanna-be, nash, in this film and go for the real thing (again, someone from dante's peak coincidentally.)

"regarded by many critics as one of the biggest stinkers of all time (certainly the biggest stinker of director brian de palma's career).  sherman mccoy (tom hanks) is a smug rich boy whose life goes to pieces when he and his lover maria ruskin (melanie griffith) are involved in a hit-and-run. his story is chronicled by another smug guy, reporter peter fallow (bruce willis).  well, as i said in my summary...  what is this movie supposed to be? it seems to combine comedy, drama, and satire, but it sure doesn't add up to much. it's undermined by unimaginably loathsome, one-dimensional characters who you'd never want to have the displeasure of meeting in real life.  i'm no big fan of the novel (i started reading it once, but couldn't finish it because it wasn't to my liking) but it's obvious to me that those who did / do enjoy the novel consider this film to be a complete travesty.  i've never seen so many talented actors strive to hard to give a below-average movie some semblance of quality and fail. what a waste.  the problems start with casting nice guy tom hanks in a role that is clearly supposed to be unsympathetic. and the role of peter fallow in the novel was that of a brit. bruce willis is badly, badly miscast in the role. what was the thinking there.  alas, not even morgan freeman can escape the film with his dignity intact, being obliged to deliver a lame, heavy-handed lecture on 'decency' after the climax.  this movie ends up turning into an absurd farce.  i liked the assemblage of talent; for that i will give it four out of ten, but i'm sure some people will say a much better movie could have been made from the source material.",0
"note to all directors: long is not necessarily good. this movie is incredibly long. however not good. the scenes were drawn out way, way, way, way, way too long. the sex scenes were unnecessary, and often too long. the movie edited down to 2 hours and 10 minutes or so would have been exceptional, but alas it became so boringly long that i can only give it a 2 of 10. it is way below average.  some other problems also exist in this marathon.   1) ralph fiennes plays a whole family tree. the guy who played the great-grandfather looks nothing like him, but the grandfather, father and the son (who gives us constant unneeded voice over) are all ralph fiennes with different facial hair and the same basic bull-headed personality. no one seems to notice that each of these children look like a clone of the last, even though photos of them are being snapped at every turn. this one is minor, but if the movie hadn't been 3 weeks long it wouldn't have been so annoying.  2) the fact that no news from germany was even whispered for the longest time about jews being rounded up and sent off is ridiculous. some word would have gotten to them and the thought of trying to run off would probably have been discussed. the uncle in france would surely have sent warning to try and get them to leave.  3) the love stories in this movie are totally wrong. you are spending forever telling us this thing and the development of relationships between main characters is extremely short. suddenly... people are in love and almost instantly... married. then having children. then we draw things out for 6 centuries and forget about developing relationships. this again would not have stuck out so much in a 2 hour movie, but with time spent nothing was given to us.  4) the ending was just bad. i don't want to spoil it for anyone, but you won't like it either...unless you are sadistic.  the director/writer should be tortured with having to watch this bloated garbage on a weekly basis, i mean endless loop, oops they are the same thing.   i wonder if robert redford did anything for this movie, i mean i think istvan szabo must be modeling his directing career after him. long drawn out movie which totally ruins any substance in the movie. a short description of 'the horse whisperer', and sunshine.  sunshine, perfect title. if you start watching while the sun is shining it will quite possibly be well after dark when you leave.",0

"i enjoyed the movie very much, emotionally, intellectually, and visually. it contains no violence or sex or drugs or special effects, and doesn't need them one bit, holding my attention the entire time with the visuals, story, and interspersed words of wisdom.  however: [1] some of the foreign language accents made the dialog difficult to hear & understand; [2] there is unnecessary overuse of swearing (especially the f-word, which is the only reason this movie was rated r). [3] the movie is balanced with humor and emotion, but most of the emotion that holds you throughout the film, except the final resolution last minutes, is unpleasant due to the exaggerated long-lasting dysfunctional reaction of some of the characters to loss, living in the depths of bitterness and depression for too long. [4] i will not recommend this movie because of 5-seconds of background narration, which did not add one bit to the side-character it applied to, or the film -- it only turned me off to the movie and stuck in my brain through the whole movie and afterward: the main character's mother of german ancestry, when watching old wwii movies, ""secretly roots for the germans."" there would be no ""local color"" or art if the nazi's won the war. i don't know of any germans today except radical skinheads who think the world would be a better place if the nazi's won wwii.",0

"i enjoy a good, slow-moving drama. christmas in august, chungking express, virgin stripped bare by her bachelors, the way home, springtime in a small town, hana bi, eat drink man woman, dolls, in the mood for love, and spring summer fall winter spring are all enjoyable films  just to name a few.   unfortunately, there is a subset of films within the drama genre that attempt to ride the coattails of good films while providing nothing of interest themselves. these are what i call ian films  ""incomprehensible artistic nonsense."" tsai ming-liang is the king of this subgenre, and vive l'amour is his ""masterpiece."" in fact, this is the crème de la crème of crap-infested garbage under the guise of ""art."" people walk around in their apartments, drink water, stroll back and forth waiting for pay phones to become vacant, hang posters, staple papers together, go to the bathroom, eat, do pushups, have sex, slap at mosquitoes, etc. i'm not joking when i say that is an accurate synopsis of the entire film, which is the quintessential posterchild for pointless art-house trash. there is no plot, no storyline, no interesting or noteworthy events, no emotion, no meaningful dialogue, and most importantly  no drama.  the most eventful scene has two people ""banging"" on a bed with a person masturbating underneath the mattress  ironic that it's also totally tasteless and gratuitous. the relationship of the characters on the bed is practically non-existent. tsai apparently didn't feel like communicating anything to the viewer regarding these people other than the obvious fact that they like to ""bang."" the person under the bed is just as one-dimensional and uninteresting. he likes to drink water, makeout with melons, and stroke himself. this is tsai's idea of ""character development."" a truly misguided ""entertainer"" indeed.  tsai's true contribution in vive l'amour is perhaps the most atrocious scene in art-house film history. he first shows the lead actress walk all the way from one end of a park to the other for 285 consecutive seconds, only to then show her cry hysterically  for absolutely no reason whatsoever  for another 356 consecutive seconds. the film then abruptly ends. no point. no entertainment. just pure, concentrated torture inflicted on the viewer.   in an effort to beat a dead horse. the underlying theme of loneliness is mishandled so greatly that the only true feeling of this film is that of boredom. in fact, kiyoshi kurosawa provides a much better exposition on loneliness in his horror film kairo. and guess what? it's actually interesting! that film moved as slow as molasses in january, but there are better ways of addressing the concept of loneliness than the utter waste known as vive l'amour. kairo is a perfect example of that.  fans of cinema may thank tsai ming-liang for directing this film, as he has provided irrefutable evidence that art-house cinema can be just as poorly made as b-grade, made-for-television horror flicks. art-house snobs have now officially lost their pedestal of self-righteousness. the quality level of your precious genre now overlaps films like army of darkness and  gasp!  showgirls. how do you like them apples?",0
"i love a good war film and i fall into the ""been there, done that"" category. so i would like to think my review is an accurate one (imho). having just watched this film on dvd i can safely say that it was a pile of rubbish. there is no way i can recommend this film to you.  it started off with me shouting at the tv saying ""you wouldn't do that"" etc...but i soon realised that having a bit of job experience would be a hindrance so i chilled a bit. but on the opening scene when the trailer wheel fell off i got a nasty feeling that this film would be a predictable dud...i was right.  there simply wasn't any logic to the eod scenes. i just know that the army team had some of the most patient insurgents ever at the other end of the command wire or remote trigger. so much so i was left scratching my head all the time. then just when you think you know where the story is going the guys in the humvee are off out on their own driving around the desert. one of the most valuable assets in theatre out on a jolly bumping into some sas wannabe contractors.  the sniper scene was just so laughable. it just made no sense at all and made me want to switch off there and then. then for them to drag it out so long really did test my patience.it started with the ""contact right"" and went down hill fast. if you had a brit accent then you got shot but if you were part of the eod team then suddenly you were a great shot and saved the day. then just as you thought it was over it stretched on for an inexplicably long period without adding anything to the story at all. you are just left watching and asking why hasn't it ended yet?  then we had the booze scene where they just hit each other for a laugh..another scene where you just wanted it to end. it added nothing to the film.  then just as my life seemed very dull the main star went outside the wire to hunt someone down. this most be the most ridiculous scene i have ever watched. it defied all logic and ability to write a good storyline...it was senseless and awful. i still don't understand why they wasted time on it. then to watch him just jog through the busy streets heading back to camp had me rolling on the floor with laughter. pure comedy :)  the sad fact is that this storyline is all over the show without really deciding what it wants to be. i thought it was going to be stupid illogical eod scenes but then it kept going off on tangents trying to be something different. but as hard as it tried it just bored me to death. all i wanted was for it to end. it was a messy compilation of stupid scenes mixed into a batch of stupid, senseless, action(ish) scenes.  there is no way i can recommend this. maybe my work experience compromised the enjoyability but even the naive must realise this just doesn't make sense. the only thing more stupid than this film is the artificially high imdb rating...which must be the 24/7 work of the box office pr team who seem to use this website as a way of making everyone think it is good. sorry folks...it just ain't!  not recommended...it will just bore you.",0

""police python 357"" is a good example of how corneau conceived and shot his works at this time of his career. they had a splendid cinematography, painstaking screenplays and a sophisticated directing elaborated for efficiency's sake.  the police superintendent ferrot (yves montand) is a cop with unconventional methods who usually works all alone. he makes the acquaintance of a young woman sylvia léopardi (stefania sandrelli) and becomes her lover while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior ganay (françois périer). when the latter learns it, he kills her in a fit of anger. ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorably against him...  one could deem that this kind of far-fetched story isn't exempt from glitches and sometimes, one can see right through it but corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a stifling, dusky atmosphere. the first part of the film before the night of the murder might seem uninteresting and however, it is crucial for what will follow this key-moment. corneau falls back on a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances by secondary, minor characters whom the viewer will see again during the investigation. in spite of drawbacks, corneau and his scenarist daniel boulanger penned a deft story. ménard (mathieu carrière) who sometimes expresses his surprise because ferrot keeps a relatively low profile during the investigation. but his superior knows that he usually works alone. actually, ferrot has to find solid tricks to muddy the waters and so to exonerate himself. eventually, the chief idea of the film concerns ferrot himself. he's a cop who bit by bit loses his identity and finds himself in the heart of a terrible depersonalization. it is epitomized by the moment when he throws himself acid on his face so that witnesses won't recognize him when he is brought face to face with them.  the backdrop of this thriller, orléans is efficiently enhanced by corneau's camera and helps to inspire this eerie thriller its pernicious charm.",1
"is this your typical women in chains navy transport love story? maybe, hell, you know how the formula works by now, pretty woman is introduced in to a picture, someone has to fall in love with her.  i think this film does follow some typical story lines, but that doesn't say anything about the content. there are great scenes with crispen glover, dennis hopper, and gary busey, although short. some things didn't make sense, such as the need to get in to random fights, but it is entertaining to watch, the fights were actually well done.  this is definitely a comedy foremost, but it does have a lot of good feel to it. the humor is well balanced, you won't hurt your stomach on this, but you will keep a smile.  there is a little bit of steamy action, so not one for the kids.",1
"there are no people like ""show people"" marion davies (as peggy pepper) and william haines (as billy boone). my introduction to ms. davies was a ""clip"" from this film; the delightfully spoofy one in which she lowers a scarf to reveal different emotions. my introduction to mr. haines was in viewing this film, presently; though, it's possible i've seen him in a less memorable role. haines makes an incredible impression, when he joins davies for a commissary meal - tossing his hat into the ring with some wonderful bits at the dining table. indeed, haines and davies deliver great comic performances.  the story starts off with dell henderson (colonel pepper) driving daughter davies into hollywood, certain she will become tinseltown's newest sensation. indeed, davies and the already arrived haines become comedy stars. but, davies yearns to become a true drama queen. davies leaves haines, and partners up with the dashingly dramatic paul ralli. but, audiences prefer davies in more comic roles; perhaps director king vidor is offering up a case for art imitating life?   full of great hollywood location footage, both on the set, and off. full of great ""cameos""; at a studio lunch, at the stars' table, davies sits between douglas fairbanks and william s. hart. the best ""bit"" player, however, is charlie chaplin, who has enough nerve to ask davies for her autograph! while the cameos are fun, they, and the episodic sequences, do help ""show people"" become less of an important film, and more of an important historical document.   ******** show people (11/11/28) king vidor ~ marion davies, william haines, dell henderson",1

"you will marvel at the incredibly sophisticated computer animation, and the novelty probably won't wear off on the first, second or third viewing, but you?ll be drawn in by the characters which are so simple yet intriguing, that you may find yourself actually caring for them in an unexpected way, which may or may not make you feel a little childish due to the medium.  disney continues to firmly hold the title of ""greatest animation in the world"", with ""a bug?s life"" standing as one of their greatest achievements. one of the innovative attachments being the delightful ""out-takes"" added to the end of the film. the dvd has two sets of these out-takes where as i?m told the vhs cassette has one alternating version per tape. the dvd also features ""gerry?s game"" which is a delightful little pixar short that was also shown prior to the film in theaters.  this is by far the superior insect-film in comparison to dreamworks? ""antz"", which in all fairness is pretty good, but lacks something in the animation and in the story development and characters. if you look at the star voices of both films, ""antz"" is largely cast with big name ""movie"" stars with a few familiar ""tv"" star voices, where ""a bug?s life"" is just the opposite, loaded with ""tv"" stars with kevin spacey as the only stand out exception. but the difference in quality is distinct and obvious.  dreamworks can?t be blamed or surprised though, when you go head to head with disney, you have your work cut out for you. this is the kind of film that almost makes me wish i had children to share it with. don?t think for a second that this is just a movie for kids, though.",1
"in all of low budget history. this movie has to be one of the worst. true ther are some humorous sides to the movie, but in general it was just plain awful. i just can't understand what person could not out run a bunch of slugs. i mean they have to be one of the slowest creatures on the planet. the only part worth while in this movie is the close up of a slugs attempt to bite the finger of a man. this was rather amusing.",0
"this is hands down the greatest stand up show ever. i've seen a lot of stand up shows ,been to a lot of stand up shows, and watch bet's comic view, but i have never seen anyone who could match the skills of murphy on this show. the impressions are excellent, the skits are great, and the timing is perfect. you can even tell the crowd gets really into. when he did raw a few years later it was also really good, but this is # 1 in my book. also shows that at one time, particularly the early-to mid eighties, that murphy was funny. my favorite parts of the show is when he is retelling the family barbecue and ""ice cream !!! mooommmm!! the ice cream man is coming !!!!"" another great part is where his mom is like clint eastwood.",1
"first off, i would like to point out that while i am not an expert, the way the trial was handled will insult your intelligence. firstly, the prosecution never proved that 'facilitated learning' actually works. irresponsible for both the prosecution(because they can get an appeal) and the defense for not acting on this. as another commenter said, facilitated learning was proved untrue. secondly, they used terry as the translator who has personal interest, and even will testify, in the trial which is just stupid. if the court had allowed him to testify that way, they would have brought in someone neutral otherwise they would be just asking for an appeal. thirdly, this child was never asked specific questions about the defendant by the prosecution(birthmarks, details of the event, etc.) and even when asked by the defense specific questions like when it started, he could not answer. if that isn't reasonable doubt i don't know what is and a competent lawyer would have gotten an acquittal.  bottom line, it starts off well with the pressures of being the parent of a child with autism, but the trial makes this movie wholly unbelievable.",0
a good film with strong performances (especially the two leads). the film is about two american girls who are caught with 6 kilo's heroin on an airport in thailand. they're both thrown in prison and one of them signs a confession. bill pullman plays the lawyer who tries to get them out. all they have to do is find a nick parks who put the narcotics in the bag of one of the two girls. so far for the story which isn't that original (it has many resemblances with the better return to paradise).  the acting and newton thomas sigel's beautiful photography make this film worth to watch. a 7 out of 10.,1
"uma thurman plays sissy, a young woman with a gypsy spirit (and freakishly large thumbs) who hitchhikes cross-country, eventually finding her true place amongst a group of peyote-enlightened cowgirls on a ranch devoted to preserving the whooping crane; rain(bow) phoenix is their lesbian leader, bonanza jellybean, who falls in love with sissy, thumbs or not. gus van sant directed and adapted tom robbins' book, but his satire has no primary target and just skitters all over the map, like sissy (maybe that was his goal, but it's not involving for an audience). notorious box-office flop wasn't so much panned as it was ignored, and one can see why: it's a series of sketches in search of a plot, and the performances, directorial touches and cinematography are all variable. thurman is a stitch posing alongside the highway trying to get a ride, but this pretty much put the kibosh on phoenix's career. writer buck henry (who didn't write this, but perhaps should have) gives the most assured performance as the doctor who works on one of those thumbs.  two thumbs down.",0
"i must admit that i had my doubts about this movie before i was going to watch it. the main reason for that is because it was compared to a hitchcock movie. i've seen several movies that were said to be inspired by hitchcock or that could have been made by the 'master of suspense' himself, but so far i haven't seen any of these movie that would be able to stand the test of time. in my opinion hitchcock has become a household name which is too easily used to promote some (cheap) thrillers, but on the other hand i must admit that i was intrigued by it because this is a european movie. normally it's the big hollywood studios who like to abuse hitchcock's name if that can raise their income. but this movie was made in one of the most chauvinistic european countries ever and i'm sure that most french would rather drop dead than to admit that their movies have been inspired by an englishman. that's why i decided to give this movie a try and i must say that i'm glad that i did.  ""sur mes lèvres"" or ""read my lips"" as it is called in english, tells the story of a young secretary named carla. she is a hardworking and loyal employee, but has never been very appreciated by her colleagues. that has much to do with the fact that she suffers from a hearing deficiency, which has denied her to climb up on the hierarchical ladder of the company. but when she is allowed to hire a trainee that can work for her, all this is about to change. paul angeli is a 25 year old and completely unskilled ex-convict. the man is a thief, but carla gives him a chance and covers for him when needed. she hopes to teach him what a regular life should look like, but at the same time he drags her with him in his old life...  since i still believe that the name hitchcock is used too often to describe a very good thriller - which this movie definitely is - i will not make any comparisons between hitchcock and jacques audiard's directing. fact is that the man has done a really good job with this movie. i hadn't heard of him before, but it is true that he knows how to build up suspense and how to keep you interested from the beginning until the end. that also has a lot to do with the very fine and original story of course. i doubt if there is someone in hollywood who has ever come up with the idea of using a handicapped woman in a powerful role, instead of making her the helpless subject of an abusive husband (you know, the typical tv-movie story).  also worth noticing is the acting in this movie. vincent cassel is quite famous, but emmanuelle devos was a complete mystery to me. there is absolutely nothing glamorous about their roles, but they both did an excellent job with their characters, making them feel very believable and realistic. paul could have been the average tough guy right out of jail and carla the typically helpless woman, but thanks to their performances, you really believe that these are two strong people who both have had some bad luck in life but who will make the best out of it together.  all in all this is a powerful movie with a very fine script and some excellent acting. despite the fact that i had my doubts about it, i've soon become one of its greatest admirers. i give this movie an 8/10. don't hesitate to give it a try.",1
"an enjoyable batman animated film. not on par with ""return of the joker"" or ""mask of the phantasm"", but solid nonetheless. i liked how the movie kept you guessing as to who batwoman was. there was nice twist. nice action sequences. i've always been of the opinion that the batman cartoons are better then any of the pitiful batman live action film sequels. the trend continues here.  7.5 out of 10",1
"had this movie been made just a few years later, i would have knocked down the score a point or two because the sound quality was rather poor. at times, the movie appeared to be a silent film during the in-between-scenes (normal ambient sounds are missing). but, given it was 1931 and a french movie, this is quite forgivable. especially since this also occurs in later french films--by which time the sound difficulties should have been worked out completely (such as in l'atalante from 1934).  okay, apart from some minor sound problems, this is a cute little film about a missing winning lottery ticket and a long list of people trying to get it. and, during the search there are lots of jaunty little songs that you can't help but like. a nice charming film all-in-all.",1
"this picks up about a year after the events in ""basic instinct"". catherine tramell (sharon stone) is now in london. while having sex with a soccer player while speeding about in a car going at 110 miles/hour (don't ask) she goes off the road and ends up in the thames. she survives--he doesn't. the police hire psychiatrist michael glass (david morrissey) to see if she's mentally competent to stand trial. naturally she starts playing with his mind instead and plenty of murders and sex follow.  this movie was doomed before it even opened. it took forever to get a cast and director, script problems were constant and the cast was not happy (morrissey complained about the movie often). still it's not too bad. it's a lot like the first--there's a lush music score, beautiful locations, plenty of sex and nudity (this had to be edited for an r), a nicely convoluted plot and good acting--but there's no impact. it feels like a retread of the first. people are being killed here with a choker leash (i believe)...just like people were being killed by an ice pick in the first. in one cute moment stone picks up an ice pick and looks at it longingly. she's also playing mind games with a man and might be getting him implicated in murders. the similarities are too apparent.  this is also very r rated--there's plenty of explicit sex talk, male nudity (morrissey looks a lot better nude than michael douglas), female nudity (stone still looks great) and some bloody murders. the acting is good across the board. stone is just fantastic here; morrissey looks miserable but is ok; charlotte rampling and david thewlis are good in supporting roles.  so--this isn't at all bad but feels like a remake of the first. still i recommend it. people just attacked this because stone is not well liked and they thought it was stupid to do a sequel to ""basic..."" 14 years after it was made.",1
"the dancing was probably the only watchable thing about this film -- and even that was disappointing compared to some other films. my gawd!  to me, this is the worst kind of film -- one that assumes it's a work of art because it has all the trappings of film-as-art. yes, it's beautifully photographed, but ultimately lacks the depth and tension of the dance around which the film supposedly surrounds itself. tango is a tease, it's hot, it has drama, it's audacious -- precisely what this film is not.",0

"in panic in the streets richard widmark plays u.s. navy doctor who has his week rudely interrupted with a corpse that contains plague. as cop paul douglas properly points out the guy died from two bullets in the chest. that's not the issue here, the two of them become unwilling partners in an effort to find the killers and anyone else exposed to the disease.  as was pointed out by any number of people, for some reason director elia kazan did not bother to cast the small parts with anyone that sounds like they're from louisiana. having been to new orleans where the story takes place i can personally attest to that. richard widmark and his wife barbara bel geddes can be excused because as a navy doctor he could be assigned there, but for those that are natives it doesn't work.  but with plague out there and the news being kept a secret, the new orleans pd starts a dragnet of the city's underworld. the dead guy came off a ship from europe and he had underworld connections. a new orleans wise guy played by jack palance jumps to a whole bunch of erroneous conclusions and starts harassing a cousin of the dead guy who is starting to show plague symptoms. palance got rave reviews in the first film where he received notice.  personally my favorite in this film is zero mostel. this happened right before mostel was blacklisted and around that time he made a specialty of playing would be tough guys who are really toadies. he plays the same kind of role in the humphrey bogart film, the enforcer. sadly i can kind of identify with mostel in that last chase scene where he and palance are being chased down by widmark, douglas, and half the new orleans police. seeing the weight challenged zero trying to keep up with palance was something else because i'm kind of in zero's league now in the heft department.  kazan kept the action going at a good clip, there's very little down time in this film. if there was any less it would be an indiana jones film. panic in the streets won an oscar for best original screenplay that year.  kazan also made good use of the new orleans waterfront and the french quarter. some of the same kinds of shots are later used in on the waterfront. in fact panic in the streets is about people not squealing when they really should in their own best interest. very similar again to on the waterfront.  panic in the streets does everyone proud who was associated with it. now why couldn't elia kazan get some decent new orleans sounding people in the small roles.",1
"i liked this movies. its a another yash raj film which you know will look good on screen, all character are always nice or very nice with one exception who you know will eventually covert to being nice... another rule of yash raj's film is that either hero or heroine;s have only one or none parent. think back to all of those films.. mpk suman didn't have mom, hmapk salman didn't have parents, and final rule is that you are 90% likely to see alock nath crying...  the film is good too. its a bit slow at first but keeps you entertained. there is almost no comedy but it does make you smile often enough. the little kid (hero's nephew) is well placed and deliver very good one liners. the actress is very pretty but shy you wouldn't get that in real life. this film doesn't have massively big happy families living in big house which i thou was a good idea and allowed the film to be differentiated from other films. there will be lots of women crying at the end of the film. there isn't a strong message from this film but its a good watch. if you are married (arranged marriage)the film will remind you of what you went through. and if you are not it will inform and may be scare you ...  overall a very good looking film. no big plots or twists but a very gentle film, very much like bollywood classic.",1
"i always thought people were a little too cynical about these old andy hardy films. a couple of them weren't bad. modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty, so goody-two shoes movies like these rarely get praise  nonetheless, i can't defend this movie either. you can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story. watching this, you just shake your head ask yourself, ""how stupid can you get?"" this is cornier than corny, if you know what i mean. it is so corny i cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hour-and-a-half.  the story basically is ""andy"" (mickey rooney) trying to get out of jam because he makes up some story about involved with some débutante from new york city as if that was the ultimate. people were a lot more social-conscious in the old days. you'd hear the term ""social-climber"" as if knowing rich or beautiful people was the highest achievement you could make it life. it's all utter nonsense, of course, and looks even more so today.  however, it's about as innocent and clean a story and series (there were a half dozen of these andy hardy films made) as you could find. also, if you like to hear judy garland sing, then this is your ticket, as she sings a couple of songs in here and she croons her way into andy's heart. oh man, i almost throw up even writing about this!",0
"wow! only a movie this ludicrously awful could inspire the similar ""showgirls."" i mean where to begin? the indescibably horrid theme song? pia zadora's non-expressions throughout the movie? the fact that despite being set in los angeles, aka ""land of the casting couch"" every single man (and woman!) is fawning all over themselves to sleep with pia zadora, by any contrived means necessary? or what about the fact that every person in the movie is totally unsympathetic because they're either mind-numbingly stupid (pia) or obvious despicable sleazeball (everyone else)? and given that this flick was written by actual ""screenwriters (sorta), it shows a shocking lack of understanding of the movie-making industry (who the hell would admire and kiss up to a screenwriter?)  but it's (unintentionally) funny as hell though. the ""breakdown"" scene alone will have you giggling, and after seeing the climatic ""i'm not the only one who had to **** her way to the top"" scene at the ""awards"" (all done in the usual bargain-basement acting level we expect from such quality thespians as pia), i sincerely hope that our dear pia actually reused that speech when she ""won"" her golden globe. it's fitting and that would totally make my day.  anyway, if you're a fan of bad, tashy camp, give this otherwise tacky movie a try.",0
"it's very sly for all of the 60's look to the movie. the humor is quite gentle, but it grew on me much more than i expected. the cast is first-rate and they appear to be having a wonderful time. ustinov wanders through the film muttering some quite funny things under his breath, and it's all very inconsequential; i'll buy the movie as soon as it comes out on dvd. the plot is that ustinov as an embezzler released from prison posing as a computer whiz and embezzling money from an american company with an office in london. maggie smith is his secretary for a while, and watching her get fired from many different jobs is part of the fun. bob newhart is his usual deadpan self, and karl malden has fun as the dense and sleazy executive running the london office. the ending is funny and nicely cynical.",1
"'where the sidewalk ends (1950)' opens, appropriately, with dana andrews' and gene tierneys' names inscribed on the sidewalk, as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate. the sidewalk represents respectability, integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter. but even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion, and, when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end, sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting one's shoes wet. mark dixon (dana andrews) was born in the gutter, his father a professional criminal, and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk, perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb. as a police detective, dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked, but he possesses a mean-streak that he can't escape. when his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead, dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised, a cheap criminal who'll cheat and lie to cover up his offence.  'where the sidewalk ends' was the only film to reunite dana andrews, gene tierney and director otto preminger after the superb 'laura (1944),' though the two films, as far as noir goes, couldn't be further apart. whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a country-house murder tale, this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama. given her ravishingly memorable performance as laura hunt, it's unfortunate that here tierney is grossly underused, occupying the typical niche of the pretty, helpless romantic interest {much as she did that same year in jules dassin's 'the night and the city (1950)'}. andrews, on the other hand, has rarely been better, exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that i hadn't expected of him. gary merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss scalise, but he doesn't seem mean enough for the role, and i think that an actor like richard conte (who played mr. brown in 'the big combo (1955)') would have better suited the character; i hadn't realised this, but conte appeared just one year earlier in preminger's 'whirlpool (1949).'  the tension, as dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime, is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though i feel that the situation still wasn't exploited to its full potential. the taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified dixon as the perpetrator, but preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes dixon on the stairs. had the witness been brought in as dixon was re-enacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance, we could have had some genuine fireworks. and why, for that matter, couldn't the taxi driver's testimony have immediately absolved jiggs taylor (tom tully) from suspicion of murder? niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from ben hecht, who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hard-hitting cops and wise-cracking felons. andrews' seething and implosive law-enforcer, tormented by rage and remorse, has rarely been done better, at least the equal of robert ryan in nicholas ray's 'on dangerous ground (1952).'",1
"was convincing the world that he didn't exist...  this is a line that is probably remembered by a lot of people. it's from the usual suspects of course in relation to kaiser gold..i mean sose..  i got another one like that: -the dumbest trick a director ever pulled was trying to convince an audience he actually had a storyline-  this movie is one of the saddest pieces of film-making i have seen in a long time. it starts out so well, with really fantastic cinematography, great acting and a very smart premise. but alas, the only way this movie is heading is on a course of self-destruction. and it does so, not by a single blow but with nagging little wrist-cuts.  pay no attention to the comments here that marvel at the fact that they found a way to explain this donut. with enough booze in my brain i would probably be capable of explaining the very existence of mankind to a very plausible degree. i have seen and read about a dozen totally different ways people explained the story. and they vary from a story set totally in someones head, playing chess with himself, to a cunning way for a criminal to play out his enemies by means resembling chess gaming.  and that's all jolly swell. but at the same time it is a painful giveaway that there is something terribly wrong with this story. and apart from that, it is in any case a blunt rip off of a score of movies and books like ""fight club, kill bill, casino, the usual suspects, snatch, magnolia and shachnovelle. and we are not dealing with kind borrowing here, it's a blatant robbery.  what ultimately goes wrong here in this movie is that the storyline swirls like a drunk bum on speed. if this movie was a roller-coaster ride, you'd have crashed into the attraction next to it shorty after take off. there are so many twists in this movie which will never be resolved, that if it was a cocktail, you'd be needing a life supply of hurl-buckets to work of the nausea after drinking it. nothing is ever explained and when you finally get some grasp of the direction you think it's going, you get pulled in yet another one.  i guess this story wasn't going anywhere on paper and ritchy must have thought that is was awesome to make a movie out of it anyway, being the next david lynch or something.  1/10 for totally violating one's own work (ritchy: seek professional help). what could have easily been a gem instead becomes a contrived art-piece, food for pseudo intellectuals to debate on at sundayafternoon debating-clubs.   spare your soul and stomach, avoid at all cost!",0
"i saw this film as it was the second feature on a disc containing the previously banned video nasty 'blood rites'. as blood rites was entirely awful, i really wasn't expecting much from this film; but actually, it would seem that trash director andy milligan has outdone himself this time as seeds of sin tops blood rites in style and stands tall as a more than adequate slice of sick sixties sexploitation. the plot is actually quite similar to blood rites, as we focus on a dysfunctional family unit, and of course; there is an inheritance at stake. the film is shot in black and white, and the look and feel of it reminded me a lot of the trash classic 'the curious dr humpp'. there's barely any gore on display, and the director seems keener to focus on sex, with themes of incest and hatred seeping through. the acting is typically trashy, but most of the women get to appear nude at some point and despite a poor reputation, director andy milligan actually seems to have an eye for this sort of thing, as many of the sequences in this film are actually quite beautiful. the plot is paper thin, and most of the film is filler; but the music is catchy, and the director also does a surprisingly good job with the sex scenes themselves, as most are somewhat erotic. overall, this is not a great film; but it's likely to appeal to the cult fan, and gets a much higher recommendation than the better known and lower quality 'blood rites'.",1
"i tried to like this program; i really did. i even bought the pilot film, first on vhs and later on dvd. however, i couldn't get into this story because its two main characters: ""david"" (bruce willis) and ""maddie"" (cybill shepherd) just seemed to in love with themselves, for one thing. i admit was some clever dialog in the shows, which was a key part of the success of the tv program, and i did appreciate of lot of that dialog.   basically, this was almost like the old screwball comedy movies of the '30s and '40s with male versus female. you get lots of arguing, accusations, yelling and screaming. a lot of people apparently love that sort of bickering, but i hate it, so i never got on the moonlighting bandwagon.   only allyce beasley as the hapless aide ""agnes,"" was entertaining. it's too bad she had such little air time. shepherd was nice on the eyes and i suppose women would say the same for willis, but too much arguing between the two finally turned me off.",0
"there are some bad movies out there. most of them are rather fun. ""criminally insane 1"" was one of those flicks. so bad that it was enjoyable and had re-watch value to it. ""criminally insane 2"" has to be one of the worst movies ever made and coming from me, that's saying a lot because i am not the type of person to say anything is the worst. but trust me, this was just completely awful and running just 1 hour is 1 hour too long.  the movie has a rather incoherent storyline, but who cares about story when all you want to see is a big fat woman running around killing people because she isn't being fed. well, you don't see that in this movie, except for all of the flashback sequences that are from the first one. the new storyline could have been really funny with ethel being sent to a halfway house and murdering everyone in there, but nothing happens until the last 20 minutes of the movie and at that point you are already falling asleep.  the camera work in this movie is just atrocious. this literally reminds me of something i shot with friends of mine back when i was 15. the sound quality is something else as you can't understand a word most of the characters are saying. to give an example of how bad it is, go into a new york subway and try to understand what is being said over the loud speakers, that is what this movie sounds like. not that it matters what they are talking about anyway because the actors are about as dry as a dead piece of wood.  now i know that saying this is the worst movie out there is pretty harsh but words can't describe just how bad this movie is. if you don't believe me, see it for yourself. 1/10",0
"there is something in most of us, especially guys, that admires some really working class small town ""real men"" populist fare. and sean penn serves it up for us with a cherry on top. hey, a lot of people use penn as a political whipping boy, but i don't rate movies or actor/directors based on politics or personality. that is what right wing commentators like excretable faux movie reviewer debbie schlussel does. while acknowledging he is one of our best actors and a good director, i think this picture was a simplistic piece of aimless dreck that he has atoned for since.   okay, you have the gist of this there is this good cop, a small town trooper, joe, played against type by david morse, who in the opening scene chases some guy on a country farm road in big sixties cars. the bad guy stops, gets out, shoots at him so joe has to blast him dead. there was no explanation what drove this man to do such a desperate violent thing and the dead man's parents do some redneck freak out at the police station while joe feels real sad and guilty that he had to kill someone. so we know that joe, the farmer forced off his land into a cop job, is a good basic sort of guy. then his brother frank shows up, he is a sadistic, amoral bully, fresh out of the army and nam where the war got his blood lust up. some people here and in other reviews called him just an irresponsible hell raising younger brother and sean was trying to make some point about what our john wayne tough guy culture and war does to otherwise good people but what i saw was an amoral, sadistic bully who enjoys hurting and ripping people off. then there is mom and dad, marsha mason and charles bronson, who do the requisite turn as old fashioned country couple, then die off; she by illness and he by shotgun suicide, to advance the story for us. both times frank the bad guy is away being a miserable sob. but good joe brings him back to podunksville from jail so frank can straighten his life out by welding bridges and living with his utterly stupid screaming trashy pregnant wife. but joe has a nice wife, played by italian actress valeria golina, who is mexican and sean uses this as an exercise in some affirmative action embellishment of goody joe and his real soulfulness underneath his uniform and crew cut. for me, that was an utterly pointless affirmative action subplot that sean uses to burnish his tough guy creds by sucking up to mexicans because mexicans are so tough and cool.  but frank is bad and we get the requisite events like stealing friend's car, robbing gas station by beating the clerk over the head then torching the car and all those cool things that hell raisers do. then there are the mandatory 8mm film childhood flashbacks of young joey dutifully moving the lawn and cowboy dressed franky jumping on his back and wrestling him and yadda yadda so we all know what deep bond there is between the two of them.  so the film meanders around with a lot of small town schlock to warm the heart of any red stater. accompanying the film was a great soundtrack of good sixties songs like jefferson airplane and janis joplin which were totally inappropriate, except for the 60's era effect, to win the hearts of old hippies. the worst offense is that, since the movie was inspired by a springsteen song, ""the highway patrolman"", that song was not included.   so joe's brain dead wife goes into labor and joe runs off to the bar to get loaded and spout some populists drunken victim's spiel about how tough things are while good joey comes to drag him back to his wife. the bartender is good ole ceasar, played by dennis hopper. so viggo - frank whigs out for no particular reason and beats his pal ceasar to death after good joe the cop leaves.  so joe has chase his bad brother down and i was so hoping that he would do the right thing and blow that menace to society away. instead we get a scene where his brother stops ahead of him in some old 50's junker on some lonely road at night, and little franky in his cowboy suit and cap guns gets out of the car to face good joe, the kid from the 8mm flashback home movie sequence. oy, such dreck! then to top off this drecky sap fest, there is some zen crap about the indian runner, who is a messenger, becomes the message, ala marshall macluhen? see what i mean, sean has done much better than this so don't be afraid to miss this one.",0
"this batman movie isn't quite as good as batman mask of the phantasm and batman and mr. freeze subzero but it is still a good installment to the batman cartoons i say it is equally good as batman beyond the movie. this movie is good for all the same reasons the storyline is good not quite as good as the other one's but still pretty good it has lots of action in it the cartoon effects are good the voice of actors are really good such as kevin conroy as batman/ bruce wayne, tara strong as barbra gordon, efrem zimbalist jr., eli marienthal as robin. the villains are good such as kyra sedgwick as batwoman, david ogden stiers as the pequin, hector elizondo as bane. so i am sure you will not be disappointed with batman mystery of the batwomen. so make sure that you rent or buy batman mystery of the batwoman the movie because it is really good.  overall score: ******* out of **********   *** out of *****",1
"what's the point of reviewing a movie like this? it's painfully and embarrassingly bad, not even in a way that allows you to make fun of it.  movies like ""little man"" depress me. they represent film at its most disposable. this movie was made for a bunch of 18-24 year old dipsh*t frat boys who the studio was hoping would come out and see it on opening night before word leaked out about how bad it was, so that the film could quickly recoup its investment.  a hundred other filmmakers with great ideas probably couldn't get their films made because resources were going toward making this puddle of vomit.  grade: f",0
"when you put this dvd into your player and hit ""play,"" you will experience a brief moment of silence and see a black screen as the laser is guided to the correct starting point in the center of the disc. cherish this moment. make sure you have some tylenol or something (preferably pm's so you can fall asleep), because you're going to have a massive headache once this movie starts.  starring a bunch of big-breasted girls and with an opening that actually made me chuckle a bit, i thought i'd be in for a good time. sure, the opening sequence was a wee bit awkward and most of the jokes fell flat and it seemed like this was going to be a scream ripoff (by the way, my sole chuckle was from julie strain's final comment in this scene). but then i knew there was trouble... the opening sequence had a terrible rock song. during this terrible rock song, i looked over the dvd chapter titles and saw things that said ""topless in the backyard!"" and ""better than sex!"". i knew what the selling point of this movie was going to be.  and that's the sad truth: the only good thing about this movie is the attractive cast. other than that, it's a sadly routine slasher film that throws in an ""innovative"" concept about murder clubs, which ends up being fake anyway. so, the whole movie then points in another direction to try to be confusing and this huge mystery, but it all just adds up to not being interesting at all and leaves you feeling like you don't care for any of the characters. i mean, when the main character of the movie is revealed to have murdered an innocent woman, can you really feel any sympathy towards her when she's in fear for her life? the scream influence is prevalent throughout, with a ghost face killer and some really terrible jokes. we're also treated to scenes of the main character talking to her mom and dad (lloyd kaufman! the only other cool part of the movie!) about an abortion or something. uh. yeah... this isn't a ""so-bad-it's-good"" movie, it's just bad.  someone compared this to a troma film, but... you know, most any film that comes from full moon (or its offshoot, as this film proves) is horrible. not horrible in a troma sense -- i've seen many troma films, and i can honestly say they all offer something, anything that you can walk away with and tell your friends about later. however, this film has pretty much nothing at all enjoyable about it. beware.",0
"vivacious & irrepressible, anne of green gables brings unlooked-for happiness into the lives of a lonely old sister & brother on prince edward island.  lucy maud montgomery's well-loved novel comes to life in this wonderful little movie. excellent production values, a literate script and first class performances gives the story exactly the touch of quality it deserves.  taking her professional name from the character she portrayed, actress anne shirley is a joy as the red-headed fourteen-year-old orphan who completely alters the lives of her new guardians. completely assured in her starring role, miss shirley is a delight, entertaining the viewer with anne's boundless imagination, quick temper and not-so-secret sorrows.  playing the stern spinster who gives the girl a home, helen westley also completely commands her role; the viewer will enjoy seeing this sharp-tongued woman slowly unbend to anne's affection and child-like innocence. australian character actor o. p. heggie gives one of his finest performances as westley's shy, gentle brother who welcomes anne into his heart from the moment he arrives to fetch her from the railroad station.  tom brown most agreeably plays the schoolboy who quickly grabs anne's attention. sara haden is appropriately prickly as a nosy neighbor. charley grapewin makes the most of his few moments as avonlea's doctor.",1
"this show started out with great mystery episodes. i think everyone is in the first 15 or 16 episodes. after that, the show started playing short episodes with shaggy, scooby doo, and scrappy doo.  i think hanna barbera productions had to change 20 minutes episodes into short episodes. some of the voice actors became unavailable. after 15 or 16 episodes, frank welker (who played fred) became unavailable. i think the voice of velma changes after first 12 episodes, because the first voice actress who played velma was unavailable.  and the network ordered the hanna barbera studio to make more shorts with shaggy, scooby doo, and scrappy doo, because the ratings were high. so they had to make more shorts. i wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. still it is a good show.",1
"master director ching siu tung's perhaps most popular achievement is this series, a chinese ghost story 1-3. chinese ghost story stars leslie cheung in some distant past in china as a tax collector who is forced to spend a night during his ""collecting trip"" in a mysterious castle in which some strange old warriors fight and meet him. beautiful actress joey wang/wong is the ghost who lives in that castle and is under a domination of one powerful demon, a wood devil who collects human souls for herself/itself with the help of her beautiful ghosts. leslie and joey fall in love, and even though ghosts are not allowed to live with humans, they decide to break that rule and live happily together for the rest of their lives. this is not what the wood devil thinks and our protagonists have to fight for their lives and their happiness.  this film is no less full of magic than other films by ching siu tung. his masterpieces include duel to the death (1983) and the swordsman series, which all have incredible visuals and kinetic power in their action scenes. ghost story is full of brilliant lightning and dark atmosphere, which is lightened by the strong presence of the beautiful and good willing ghost. the effects are simply breath taking and would work at their greatest power in the big screen. the camera is moving and twisted all the time and it adds to the fairy tale atmosphere this film has. there's plenty of wire'fu stunts, too, and even though some think they are and look gratuitous or stupid when used in films, i cannot agree and think they give motion pictures the kind of magic, freedom and creativeness any other tool could not give. when people fly in these films, it means the films are not just about our world, and they usually depict things larger than life with the power of this larger than life art form.  the story about the power of love is pretty touching and warm, but the problem is (again) that the characters are little too shallow and act unexplainably occasionally. leslie and joey should have been written with greater care and their characters should be even more warm, deep and genuine in order to give the story a greater power and thus make the film even more noteworthy and important achievement. also, the message about love and power of it is underlined little too much at one point and it should have been left just to the viewer's mind to be interpreted and found. another negative point about the dialogue is that it's too plenty and people talk in this film without a reason. that is very irritating and sadly shows the flaws many scriptwriters tend to do when they write their movies. people just talk and talk and it's all there just to make everything as easy to understand as possible and so the film is not too challenging or believable as it has this gratuitous element. just think about the films of the japanese film maker takeshi kitano; his films have very little dialogue and all there is is all the necessary as he tells his things by other tools of cinema and never talks, or makes other characters talk too much in his movies. this is just the talent the writers should have in order to write greater scripts.  otherwise, chinese ghost story is very beautiful and visually breath taking piece of eastern cinema, and also the song that is played in the film is very beautiful and hopefully earned some award in the hong kong film awards back then. i give chinese ghost story 7/10 and without the flaws mentioned above, this would without a doubt be almost perfect masterpiece of the fantasy genre.",1
"""written on the wind"" is a douglas sirk's melodrama. douglas sirk was rediscovered by the ""cahiers du cinema"", fassbinder etc.. that hailed him as a master director - i think that it is because of the sophistication of his cinematography - ""written on the wind"" offers luscious color images and gorgeous decors. but i ask myself: is this enough to carry a film? the acting in ""written on the wind"" ranges from weak to fair (excepting robert stack - he is convincing as the weak & spoiled playboy). lauren bacall, normally a powerful presence in the screen, is miscast in this film. dorothy malone as the seductress, the care-free ""femme fatale"" is ok, but she lacks the strength for the role. rock hudson is efficient but vapid .  the plot has very interesting ingredients. the main characters are:   a rigid patriarch   his alcoholic son kyle (robert stack) (never loved by the disappointed father)   his frustrated and nymphomaniac daughter marylee (dorothy malone)  lucy (lauren bacall) - a woman of principles, formerly a secretary and now married to kyle   mitch (rock hudson) - brought up together with kyle and loved by the patriarch.   secrets beyond the door, a love triangle, frustration, fistfights, laughter, death etc. - well, when i read the story summary on the back cover of the dvd i thought that i was in for a treat. my mistake! why? i'll try to explain: ""written on the wind"" takes itself seriously and tries to tell a dramatic story. as i said before the acting, in general, is not good enough - the intensity is lacking. there are many strong scenes in the story, but the actors just do an efficient job. i think that maybe with italian or spanish actors those scenes would have been explored fully - they would end (for us) in an explosion of laughter or tears .  what remains to us is the beautiful cinematography of douglas sirk. for me this is not enough. if you want to enjoy a good melodrama, see ""aventurera"".",1
"as i am not a blood and guts fan i found the gory scenes totally unnecessary (you spell it) and too real for my liking, if you're the type of person who gets their rocks off on beheadings on the internet or snuff movies i say go for it, it beggars belief what sort of person dreams this sick crap up though.  apart from that it had the potential to be a great movie, the music was top class too (through the movie and especially the end credits). some parts though were a bit unbelievable, like you've just been found by your girlfriend trust up awaiting torture and death and all you do is tell her about what had happened and how you got there, (why didn't he ask her if she happened to have any wipes or even some air freshner or a piece of gum while he was at it?), come on now, most would probably just scream ""hurry up and untie me then lets get the f*** out of here quick!"". where were the flys, maggots etc, and when the girl accidentally came across the place surely the stench of rotten flesh would have sounded a few alarm bells! i would only recommend this movie to friends of dennis niellson and the like, i'm sure a video like this would make sickos like that have a very happy christmas.",0
"cartoon network seems to be desperate for ratings. beginning with the cancellation of samurai jack, the network seemed hellbent on removing all the shows that made it so popular, such as the powerpuff girls, dexter's lab, dragonball z, etc. when the ratings started to plummet, cn began putting up some pretty mediocre shows. though total drama island/action and chowder stand out because of their clever writing and audience-pleasing gimmicks, there are plenty of other shows that either terrible remakes (george of the jungle) or rip offs of other shows, such as the marvelous misadventures of flapjack, where the title character acts just like spongebob, and then there's johnny test, which is something of a replacement for dexter's laboratory, though it's much more of a sheer rip off than anything.  the show's characters are clearly derived from dexter's lab, only this time the focus is on johnny, a blonde (or fiery-haired) character who torments his twin sisters, susan and mary, who just happen to look just like dexter, from the orange hair, to the glasses, the impossible technology. there is even a rival genius named bling bling boy or eugene, who appears to be sitting in for mandark. then there's dookie, johnny's best friend and talking dog, one of dexter's...i mean, susan and mary's early experiments.  dexter's laboratory was probably one of the best cartoons on television, with its simple, but effective art style, lovable main character, and episodes that don't seem to be a long drag. johnny test is a lot different. the art style here isn't nearly as eye-pleasing. in fact, it looks absolutely awful. the characters have motivations that make them really annoying or repulsive. like how most of the series' episodes consist johnny and dookie's quest for havoc on the neighborhood girl sissy, whom johnny secretly likes, or the twins' obsession over a boy next door. seeing these two geniuses swoon at the sight of abs and the fact that johnny appears to be someone you would never want to associate with, there is no real connection between the viewer and characters.  one thing the series heavily exploits in its name is that johnny is susan and mary's guinea pig for their experiments. these range from turning johnny fat, ugly, monstrous, and even into a woman. the twins then help johnny in whatever scheme he's planning in return for his services. whenever there's an episode involving this kind of ""win/win"" deal, it usually comes undone at the seems and those that doesn't come completely off the rails never ends satisfyingly.  the writing ranges from mediocre to horrid, however. the 'fat' episode constantly repeats ""it's phat with a ph. there's a difference, you know."" which is a line that should never be repeated, especially when the episode seems to promote child obesity, with johnny becoming a famous star with money and videogames just by becoming fat.  let's talk about how the show doesn't completely rip off dexter's lab. the show tosses in a lot of characters, from two men-in-black named mr. black and mr. white, a military general who seems to need all his problems solved through johnny and his sisters, and lots of super villains, though even here, the show again steals ideas for other sources, like a mr. freeze teenage clone, an evil cat with a butler who wants cats to rule over man (like the evil talking cat from powerpuff girls), a bumbling maniac mastermind, a trio of evil skater 'dudes' and even a mole man, which is probably the most cliché villain in the media.  to top it all off, alongside its ugly animation and unlikeable characters, the voice acting is either passable (like the voices for mr. black and mr. white) to just plain ear-splitting (johnny, dookie, and just about every villain in the show). the theme song seems to be the only catchy thing to this show, but then it was redone just a few episodes with a band that just ruined it.  so in the end, johnny test is not a good cartoon. its horrible references and jokes about teen culture will dismantle little children's interest in the show, while its bright coloring, ripped-off characters, and dragging episodes will ruin the experience for teens. it's just another one of those crappy shows that cartoon network is over-promoting to trick people to watching it (like mtv toward rap). if you need a show that will satisfy your children for a half hour, you'd better stick to spongebob, because johnny test is more of a ""test"" of patience than anything else.",0
"i am surprised that everyone (even the critics) seems to think this was a good movie. it was the most clichéd thriller ever made that i have seen. we have the 'bad guy' who wants to force the 'good guy' (or girls in this case) to do something or face the consequence. the 'good girl' in this movie must use her smarts and skills to defeat the 'bad guy' and save the day and her loved ones. using charisma, bravery, and even luck to save the day.   where to begin? well, a young woman by the name of lisa reisert meets a young man by the name of jackson rippner (nice name) at an airport. one coincidence leads to another and soon it seems as if fate is bringing these two together. sharing drinks, sitting next to each other, seemingly getting along in every way... is there more to this strangeness? could these two be meant for each other? does 'fate' have a reason for their strange and random encounter?   well, as it turns out, unfortunately yes. jackson needs to lisa to help him assassinate the director of homeland security by moving him from one room to another so that his men can launch an attack on him. oh, if she doesn't do this then her father is dead. though we never learn the exact reasons why and who is really behind this madness, jackson more then explains how this is going to happen and why its in lisa's best interest to help him.  of course, lisa defeats his evil plans with her smarts and in the process stabs him in the neck, makes him trip over chairs, and hitting him with a field hockey stick. oh, and before that, she leads him on wild chase through miami airport where she gets passed post 9 11 security and steals a car that she later uses to run over the man who was ordered to kill her father.   yeah, right.  first of all, i find it strange that a man like jackson who can get his hands on high tech weaponry needs the help of a hotel manager. couldn't he just sneak a bomb into the building? wouldn't that make it safer for him and his team by leaving out any third parties? and why do characters like jackson also explain everything they are going to do to someone they are threatening? doesn't that make it easier to stop them by the same people?   the actors did their best considering the movie they were given. racheal mcadams and cillian murphy are still actors to look out for. also, i believe that jayma mays (who played the 'loveable' cynthia) will be someone we will see more of. it's just too bad they all were stuck with this.  2 out of 10",0

"film critics of the world, i apologize. it is your job to give advice to the moviegoing public so that they can wisely choose what to spend money on. but i ignored your advice and i have been deeply hurt. however, my decision to see ""the cat in the hat"" wasn't made haphazardly. you see, three years ago all of you critics said that we should all avoid the ""calamity"" known as ""how the grinch stole christmas"". then some friends of mine took me to see it and it turned out to be a colorful, funny and almost hypnotic yuletide treat. so when the critics unleashed their fury against ""the cat in the hat"", another big budget seuss update with a big name star in the title role, i thought that it must be the same old song. how wrong i was.  for five whole minutes i thought i was in the clear. the opening credits are clever, the kids are charming and the production values are top notch. then the cat showed up. there are many problems from this point on, but the biggest one was the woeful miscasting of mike myers. where ""the grinch"" was saved by the inspired casting of jim carrey, ""the cat"" was destroyed by myers. he can be very funny when his energies are applied where they belong, comic sketches. every movie he's made that was truly funny was really just a feature length comedy sketch, from ""wayne's world"" to ""austin powers"". so he tries to do the same thing here, it's just that these comedy sketches are more like the stuff that they stick at the end of snl, not funny, just painful. not that the writers helped him out any. after the charming prologue the movie turns into an hour of repulsive bodily humor gags, poorly timed pratfalls and insultingly stunted attempts at hip humor. this movie was the most disheartening cinematic experience i have ever had. period. so much talent and work went into something so vile. i know that the adult stars of this movie will be relatively unscathed by this mess, i just hope that the wonderful spencer breslin and dakota fanning will get more chances to show their charms in far better movies. if you are a parent, please avoid this like the plague. with movies like ""elf"" and ""brother bear"" currently in theaters, you have far better choices.",0
"steven spielberg wanted to win an oscar so bad that he figured that he wouldn't win by directing special effects epics (he was nominated for three of them: ""close encounters of the third kind"", ""raiders of the lost ark"", and ""e.t.: the extra-terrestrial"". so he decided to get very serious by directing ""the color purple"", a period film with no special effects. spielberg's first serious drama is a remarkable movie. but the academy voters who voted back in 1985 still didn't give spielberg any respect. ""the color purple"" received 11 oscar nominations including best picture, but spielberg was unfairly snubbed when he wasn't nominated for best director. it got worse on oscar night when this film didn't win a single oscar. it got completely shut out. that wasn't right. ""the color purple"" should have won a couple of oscars including one for whoopi goldberg's spectacular film debut as celie, a woman who suffers at the hands of an abusive husband (frightfully placed by danny glover), then gets stronger throughout the film thanks to some special friends. oprah winfrey also made her film debut here and gives a great performance as sofia, one of those friends' of celie. since i'm from chicago, i had already known winfrey from her talk show (which at the time of this films' release hadn't gone nationwide). like goldberg, what a film debut! margaret avery is terrific as shug avery, another friend who also happens to be the mistress of celie's rotten husband. all three actresses received well-deserved oscar nominations for their work here (goldberg for best actress; winfrey and avery for best supporting actress). set in the south during the first half of the 20th century, ""the color purple"" is a film so strong that it made me cry at the end. it also made me laugh at times too. why academy voters were so hard on not nominating spielberg for best director is a mystery that still puzzles me today. but spielberg would eventully go on to win two oscars years later for ""schindler's list"" and ""saving private ryan"", making him one of the best movie directors of all-time. but he should have gotten nominated for this movie. the job that he did going from special effects blockbusters like ""e.t."" to a serious drama like ""the color purple"" was remarkable.  **** (out of four)",1
"the second attempt by a new york intellectual in less than 10 years to make a ""swedish"" film - the first being susan sontag's ""brother carl"" (which was made in sweden, with swedish actors, no less!) the results? oscar wilde said it best, in reference to dickens' ""the old curiosity shop"": ""one would have to have a heart of stone not to laugh out loud at the death of little nell."" pretty much the same thing here. ""interiors"" is chock full of solemnly intoned howlers. (""i'm afraid of my anger."" looking into the middle distance: ""i don't like who i'm becoming."") the directorial quotations (to use a polite term) from bergman are close to parody. the incredibly self-involved family keep reminding us of how brilliant and talented they are, to the point of strangulation. (""i read a poem of yours the other day. it was in - i don't know - the new yorker."" ""oh. that was an old poem. i reworked it."") far from not caring about these people, however, i found them quite hilarious. much of the dialog is exactly like the funny stuff from allen's earlier films - only he's directed his actors to play the lines straight. having not cast himself in the movie, he has poor mary beth hurt copy all of his thespian tics, intonations, and neurotic habits, turning her into an embarrassing surrogate (much like kenneth branagh in ""celebrity"").  the basic plot - dysfunctional family with quietly domineering mother - seems to be lifted more or less from bergman's ""winter light,"" the basic family melodrama tricked up with a lot of existential angst. it all comes through in the shopworn visual/aural tricks: the deafening scratching of a pencil on paper, the towering surf that dwarfs the people walking on the beach. etc, etc.  allen's later ""serious"" films are less embarrassing, but also far less entertaining. i'll take ""interiors."" woody's rarely made a funnier movie.",0
"so yes it is quite nostalgic watching the 1st episode because this is the one episode i definitely remembered. i enjoy watching the first season and yes compared to the action packed shows we have now this show seems lame. but frankly i like the ""less violent"" part of the show and the story line has more substance than the new ones now. i thought it interesting that belisario's airwolf and jag have similar theme - the lead actor (hawke and harm) both are looking for an mia relative (brother, father). wonder if robert belisario's personal life mimics these 2 shows' theme.  question - does anyone have pictures of hawke's cabin. i love that cabin (kinda like a dream cabin of mine) and that is one of the scenes i remember about airwolf.",1
"i first saw this movie when i was a little kid and fell in love with it at once. the sets are breath taking and some of the script is damn right hilarious: ""you sons of a thousand fleas"".  it is always shown on tv late at night or really early in the morning i woke up at about 3:00 am once and it had just started. tv companys need to show a little more respect and put it on prime time sunday so everyone can get a chance to view this fine work.  10/10",1
"nina foch delivers a surprisingly strong performance as the title character in this fun little gothic nail-biter. she accepts a position as secretary to a london society dowager (played imperiously by dame may witty) and her creepy son (the effete and bothersome george macready). before she knows it, she awakens to find herself in a seaside manor she's never seen before, where witty and macready are calling her marian and trying to convince the servants and the nearby townspeople that she's macready's mad wife. of course this pair can only be planning dastardly deeds, and even though we know julia has to eventually escape her trap, director joseph lewis builds real suspense in answering the question of just how she'll manage it.  ""my name is julia ross"" has nothing stylistically to set it apart from any number of films that came out at the same time period, but i was surprised by how well it held together despite its shoe-string budget and b-movie pedigree. there are quite a few moments that just may have you on the edge of your seat, and i found myself really rooting for julia as she caught on to the scheme underfoot and began to outsmart her captors. in any other gothic thriller, the heroine would have swooned, screamed and dithered, waiting for her hero to come and save her. so i can't tell you how refreshing it was to have the heroine in this film use her brain and figure out how to save herself.  well done.  grade: b+",1
"i would have rated the series a perfect 10 for outstanding and consistently high quality story and character development had it not been for the last episode of season 10!   the final episode of the 10th season ""unending"", where (it would certainly appear that) the asgard have been killed-off in a very rushed, unconvincing and very unceremonious fashion, left me in disbelief!   from the extremely rushed end of the series, it's obvious that many of the story arcs were originally scheduled to occur over at least one more season. my guess would be that they rapidly accelerated these stories to position the stargate sg-1 franchise for the two upcoming direct-to-dvd moves!  unless the asgard return in a future sg-1 movie (with a very good explanation of the ""apparent"" extinction), i think that the fans have been cheated with a poor clean-up of loose-ends!  poor end to an otherwise brilliant sci-fi series.",1
"time spent watching this film was time wasted. i do not dislike science fiction. i do not reject any genre per se, since good work can be done in any genre. this film, however is not good work. i cannot fault the visuals (when not involving alien makeups), and the special effects are impressive. the story was not out-and-out bad, for a trekkish comic book. but the fx visuals were obviously where all the makers' interest/attention/money went. the direction alternated between sluggish and confusing (one was not at all sure exactly who was doing what and with what and to whom at at least one crucial juncture). the ""acting"" was mostly very bad indeed. there was no basis to most of the line readings besides a hint of ""it was that way on the page and the director told me i was supposed to be mad/sad/scared/whatever. okay, so it was a sf series pilot. since when is that an excuse for correctable shoddiness in areas when should be regarded as essential to a dramatic medium. i'm astonished the pilot sold the series. or is the money also in the hands of technerds?",0
"a meteorite falls in the country of a small town, bringing a jelly creature. an old farmer is attacked by the alien in his hand, and the youths steve andrews (steve mcqueen) and his girlfriend jane martin (aneta corsaut) take him to dr. t. hallen (steven chase). the local doctor treats carefully the blister, and asks steve to investigate the location where they found the old man. when steve returns, he sees the blob killing the doctor. steve and jane try to warn the police and the dwellers, but nobody believe on them, while the blob engulfs many people, getting bigger and bigger.  ""the blob"" is a cult and classic sci-fi. it is a low budget movie, with many ham actors and actresses (with the exception of steve mcqueen), awful effects, but also delightful and very, but very funny. this is the first time that i see this classic (i had seen the 1988 remake with kevin dillon), and i really recommend it to fans of steve mcqueen and sci-fi b-movies from the 50s. the film subject of my review number 1,400 could not be better. my vote is seven.  title (brazil): ""a bolha"" (""the blob"")",1
"hello. this is my first review for any movie i have seen. i went through the trouble of doing this to tell everyone that this is quite literally, the most disgusting movie i have ever seen. i feel like the movie was porely made, which i will give some understanding due to budget constraints on making it. i felt like i was watching a very bad remake of the movie saw. which i can agree, saw as well is also very graphic, but, i did like the movie saw.  the scene where he takes the hammer to the head of the tied up victim in the chair is the most disturbing scene i have seen. the scene lasted almost forever, well actually, it was probably around 5 min but still. i want to note that i like some horror movies and i do give credit if they are good. this director uwe boll, and his group of people used to make this movie should think it over before making another one similar to this one. one final note haha!! for all the people who enjoy watching animals beatin to death, letting rot, with women and children as well and a five minute scene of someone getting there head smashed in with a hammer then you will enjoy this movie, if not, and you like horror, go with a higher budget film, like saw for example. i cant believe people actually make movies like this. anyway sorry to anyone who loves uwe boll and took it to heart, this is just my opinion on the movie.",0

"i enjoyed this show for two reasons 1. richard dean anderson 2. amanda tapping. these two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors. the replacement of rda in seasons 9-10 was enough to take the heart out of the show.  the chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous. you get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling. this relationship carries over into the program we get to see.  rda gives his 'o'neill' character believable personality. he never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest. you watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances. still, they know that he is the man to have around when the situation is perilous.  there is a lot going on between 'carter' and 'o'neill' under the surface. they manage to keep the lid on, but often just barely. the episode 'solitudes' in season 1 had some of the best drama ever seen on television. the love between the two made the prospect of dying bearable because they faced it together.  'carter' and 'jackson' often have to smooth over some of the turbulence created by 'o'neill'. yet 'o'neill's' tactical instincts always seem sound. he understands what to do without having to think about the matter. the team has several times been placed in jeopardy by the others not listening to his orders.  the quality declined markedly in seasons 9 and 10. the original story arc was mostly used up and the new villains never really caught my interest. ben browder was far inferior to rda in carrying the show. he had his rare moments with claudia black, but that was all. amanda tapping was phoning in her performances these two seasons. you could see her greatly changed appearance after having a baby. she was probably thinking more about the child than the show.  the spin-off 'stargate atlantis' has a few moments, but is mostly a weaker effort. the major characters lack the chemistry of the cast of the original. the villains (wraiths) are so improbable as to be ludicrous. maybe amanda tapping can breathe some life into the program or it won't last beyond the fourth season.  there has always been a problem for me in the special effects for the show. to have spaceships shaped as pyramids is a design monstrosity seldom equaled in sci-fi. the use of torches for illumination in these ships is just as bad. the campy use of decor from ancient egypt concealing ultra-modern technology is just as hard to accept.  i wondered about some of the continuity on the show too. in the season 2 opener, 'daniel jackson' is shot up and his uniform has a gaping hole where he was wounded. he crawls into a sarcophagus and it heals his body and restores his uniform like it just came off the rack in the wardrobe closet. the episode 'hathor' has a sarcophagus fall into the hands of the sgc, yet it is never mentioned again. this device could have been used in several later episodes on 'daniel', 'o'neill', and 'dr. frasier'.",1
"first off; i'm a dedicated fan of modesty's, and have been reading the comics since i was a child, and i have found the earlier movies about our heroine unsatisfying, but where they fail, this one rocks!   well then, here we go: ms blaise is working for a casino, a gang of robbers comes along and she starts gambling for her friends lives. if the robber wins one round, she'll have to tell him about herself. if she wins two times in a row, one of the staff members goes free. (sounds stupid, yeah, well, i'm not that good at explaining either..) ;)  she tells him about growing up in a war zone, without parents or friends, about her helping an old man in the refugee camp and how they escape, living by nature's own rules. they hunt for food, and he teaches her to read and fight. as they approach civilization they get caught up in a war, and as they are taken for rebellions, they are being shot at and the old man dies, which leaves her to meet the city by herself.  then she meets the man who's casino she's now working for, and there the story ends.   what is to follow is that there's an awesome fight and the line's are totally cool. alexandra staden is a terrific modesty blaise! just as modest and strong, graceful and intellectual as the comic-one.  feels awkward though, too hear modesty speak with a slightly broken accent, but that's not relevant since the comic book- blaise can't speak out loud, but certainly must have a somewhat existing accent. (not to mention that it's weird everybody's speaking english in the balkan..)  the acting is really good, even the child who personifies the young blaise must have a applaud!   my favorite part must be where she rips up her dress to kick the stupid robber's ass! totally awesome! :d i can't wait until the real adventure begins in the next movie/s!  watch it, you won't be disappointed!",1
"the subject is certainly compelling: a group of people take their love of gaming one step further by creating a fake medieval world full of warriors, kings, princes and castles. wargaming is an interesting phenomena that delves into our collective need to ""escape"" from reality and the sometimes mundaneness of our existence -- something almost everyone can relate to. the characters are the predictable mix of lord of the rings nerds and star trek enthusiasts. that's enough to get most people to watch. however, very quickly the film turns into an insider's view of wargaming with an almost stereotypical thumbing of the nose to viewers who ""don't get it"". the filmmakers seem to take the subject of wargaming, and this particular one, waaaaay too seriously rather than once in awhile recognizing the humor and fun in making a film about adults drssing up in medieval gear and pounding each other with foam swords. it's pretty hard for anyone who doesn't sit on their computer for 7-10 hours a day playing games or desiging the latest star destroyer to understand what the characters are talking about and why we should even care. however, the filmmakers themselves seem not to care choosing to focus solely on the subject of the game itself rather than building a strong narrative with a clear story that anyone can understand. moreover, the characters themselves are not that compelling and you quickly become bored of them: a big no-no when you're trying to keep people's attention for 90 minutes.",0
"super speedway makes a great demo of your new dvd / bigscreen / 5.1 channel sound system. the imax camera puts you right in the race car, where you cruise around various tracks at high speed, reminiscent of the driving sequences in grand prix (if only that would appear on dvd!). i enjoy watching it again and again.  the only minus, and why i didn't give it a 10, is some of the driving sequences look suspiciously like the film was speeded up. the soundtrack also requires a little suspension of disbelief - all you can hear in a real car is the engine. you won't hear swooshes as you go under bridges.",1
"this is a very memorable spaghetti western. it has a great storyline, interesting characters, and some very good acting, especially from rosalba neri. her role as the evil villainess in this film is truly classic. she steals every scene she is in, and expresses so much with her face and eyes, even when she's not speaking. her performance is very believable. she manages to be quite mesmerizing without being over the top (not that there's anything wrong with being over the top). mark damon is surprisingly good in this movie too.  the music score is excellent, and the theme song is the kind that will be playing in your head constantly for days after seeing the movie, whether you want it to or not. there are a couple of parts that are very amusing. i especially like the part where rosalba neri undresses in front of the parrot. there's also lots of slick gun-play that's very well done.  i would probably have given this movie 8 or 9 stars if it wasn't for two things. the first being a silly bar room brawl that occurs about 25 minutes into the film. this is one of the most ridiculous looking fights i have ever seen in a movie. it is very poorly choreographed, and looks more like a dance number from a bad musical than any kind of a real fight. one might be able to overlook this if it were a terence hill/bud spencer comedy, but this is a more serious western, and the brawl really needed to be more realistic. the other thing that annoyed me about this movie was yuma's cowardly mexican sidekick. i guess he was supposed to be comic relief or something, but the character was just plain stupid and unnecessary in a movie like this, and he wasn't at all funny. all i can say is where is tuco when you need him?   all that having been said, let me assure everyone reading this that johnny yuma is a classic spaghetti western despite the faults i have mentioned, and all fans of the genre need to see this movie.",1

"i saw this film and heard the writer-director, juan gerard, speak at the santa barbara int'l film festival.  all i knew about it was that it was the story of an 8-year-old boy at the time of the cuban revolution in 1958 and how it affects his home and family.  its opening scene will bring to mind ""cinema paradiso"". in fact, the film is filled with references to classic films: the roulette wheel (casablanca), ""chicken clucking"" (rebel without a cause), references to bunuel, ""touch of evil""; you'll find more. the homeless man (georg stanford brown)is a reference to cuban folklore which often uses a black man as a type of greek chorus.  what this film really is is the culmination of a dream. gerard's wish to honor his family and medium of film that he has loved all of his life.  this is the true story of juan gerard and all the people in it are real,as are the events depicted. gerard is actually an architect and engineer (and passionate film lover) but his dream was to make this movie. he and his wife decided to live that dream and harvey keitel became an ""angel"" who believed in gerard and agreed to produce and star in it. keitel holds the screen powerfully as the mysterious and secretive grandfather ""che"". brown and keitel are the only americans in the cast. iben hjejle (high fidelity) and gael garcia bernal (y tu mama tambien) offer strong support in key roles.  truthfully, the first half of the film suffers from stiff delivery of lines, and some overracting, but stay with it. the last half is much better as the events of the revolution combine for the bittersweet, and honest climax. it is the first effort of juan gerard, but it is honest as he is and his passion and heart really come through,in this sincere first effort. i would definitely see it again, and hope that he continues his film career.

"dark remains is a low budget american horror movie that somehow managed to win 2 awards.  the plot seems to involve 2 separate strands. first, a woman commits suicide by slashing her wrists whilst bathing. second, the young daughter of a technical writer is found with her throat slashed. the grieving couple decide to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains. it later transpires that the cabin and surrounding locations are haunted.  as the movie goes on, the 2 separate strands of story eventually converge as one might reasonably expect. however, the execution is haphazard and results in confusion that could perhaps only be resolved by multiple viewings. unfortunately, the movie is simply not enticing enough to attract most viewers into watching it more than once.  just about everything that could go wrong with this movie goes wrong - and fast! and the low budget cannot be used to justify all of the shortcomings found here.  i believe it would be wrong to pass judgement on the actors involved in this production as the material was simply too poor.  the characters are uninteresting as pointed out by other reviewers on this site. the badly written script introduces too many people without giving them interesting dialogue, without creating opportunities for character-driven situations and without adding depth to any of them.  the direction is uninspired. the inspiration from j-horror movies such as ringu, the grudge and one missed call is evident. unfortunately, the directors of dark remains did not pay close attention to the style of j-horror. j-horror works so effectively because it plays on fear of the unknown. tension is created by constant shifts between a bizarre situation (a ghost on a cctv camera walking towards it for example), and the reaction of a central character who is faced with it without any warning. there is no humour or tongue-in-cheek element in these movies. everything is played so straight and without remorse or limitations that you can't help but be convinced and captivated by it. the foreboding atmospheres set up the suspense and ensures the horror has psychological impact, very much unlike the ""jump scares"" used in hollywood movies.  the directors of dark remains made a brave attempt to avoid hollywood clichés and also successfully avoided using cgi. the homage to j-horror could have been well intended. unfortunately, the lack of inspiration is likely to make the viewer laugh at the supposed ""scares"" on the screen. the make-up effects of the ""ghosts"" weren't too bad given the low budget but their actions just defied logic. i was scratching my head quite a few times during this movie.  i couldn't give away the ending even if i wanted to. i simply couldn't understand it. all i could deduce was that it was something of an anti-climax.  what remains? the answer as a reviewer on a different website has pointed out is boredom. the movie is a chore to sit through. thankfully, the pain ends after an hour and a half. however, most would probably switch off long before the end.  there are only 2 positive things i could find in this movie - the successful avoidance of scare clichés and the absence of the ""f-word"" in every single sentence like one would normally expect to find. this is what the 2 stars are for.  those who like supernatural or psychological horror relating to ghosts and haunting might do well to stick to movies such as the legend of hell house, the changeling or the j-horror sub-genre.  if you think you have seen too many established movies and want to see an obscure ultra-low budget ""r-rated"" horror movie about ghosts, watch death of a ghost hunter. it may not be the greatest horror movie ever made but it is surely a lot better than dark remains and does have a few genuine surprises in store.  i advise everyone to avoid dark remains like the plague.",0
"i was always curious about this film because it is so tough to find, so when i stumbled upon it on ebay i forked over the $10 and bought it, now i understand why its so rare! this film is so bad, so terribly written and hopelessly low budget that the ending credits, which show all of the cut scenes where they fumbled their lines, are literally the movie's highlight. the film is about a psychic (pettyjohn, cast for one obvious reason, her topless scene) whom uses her powers with an experimental machine to pull objects from another dimension into this reality. when she pulls in some kind of box like object the military nonchalantly throws it into the open back of a truck with one soldier to guard it, and gee, what do you know? surprise! a kid in a foam-rubber monster costume pops out, instantly kills the soldier with a scratch across his face, then escapes to a nearby city. but rather than deploy half the armed forces of the county to find it and protect the public those in charge just leave it up to pettyjohn and ray to find it on their own, but no matter, this movie blows all its credibility long before then. this barely escapes being voted a 1 by me only because of unintentional laughs, somebody needs to alert the producers of ""mystery science theater 3000"" if they don't know about it already! 2 out 10, really, really bad!",0
"""cry freedom"" is not just a movie. it is a historical account, heroic story, and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history. not only does denzel washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating, determined hero, steve biko, but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of south arfrican apartheid. the story of biko, an influential leader, and his main ""influencee"", donald woods, is a heartbreaking one. but, the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in south africa. ""cry freedom"" manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot. it is because of great films like this one, that the public can become educated on terrible events in history, great leaders who sought to end them, and how we can never allow them to happen in the future. because of this importance, ""cry freedom"" is an amazing film that should be seen by all.",1
"rural family drama--with perhaps a nod to ""ordinary people""--concerns a young boy who withdraws into himself after fatally wounding his older brother in a shooting mishap. despite downbeat subject matter (given mercilessly glum treatment by director christopher cain), there are some dynamics in this sad story worth exploring. unfortunately, the isolated farming atmosphere and the reluctance of the adult characters to take charge of the situation render the film a stultifying experience. what with robert duvall, glenn close, and wilford brimley in the cast, the movie is nearly a small-scaled reunion of ""the natural"". too bad this project didn't get the necessary talent behind the camera to really eke out a gripping, memorable picture. *1/2 from ****",0
"i loved adrianne curry before this show. i thought she was great on top model and was really glad when she won. i also liked chris knight, he seems like a great guy. but this show just made me sick! i'm so angry at both of them for what happened on that show. i don't care that they were different ages, i know age can't stand between love. but adrianne, you had been together for only seven months. it didn't surprise me at all that he hadn't proposed. and i don't see the appeal of forcing someone to marry you before they're ready. if it's meant to be, then why not just enjoy each other's company and love each other, and let it come naturally? turning a wedding ring into a ball and chain was completely unnecessary, it's stupidly obvious that chris loves you, with or without a ring. and chris, shame on you for breaking down and proposing to her anyway! you've been through two failed marriages, how could you rush into another one just because she pitched a fit? i hope the relationship lasts, but i really feel that the marriage was rushed and for all the wrong reasons. maybe now they can take a breath and find the right reasons to be married from within the marriage.",0
"i watched, entranced and mesmerized, by the vocal and physical acting. the roles each character played were done with excellence.the lyrics,the words, every gesture, the sunrise, told it all.the movie spoke to me. it enlightened me to a different perception of a person who believes in mankind. who believes in peace and gentle behavior. i was also held in disbelieve, by the sacrifices and human dignity was portrayed. power without grace, is demented and without feelings. to want power at the cost of mankind, is so unbelievable. this movie made me so afraid for the people who are no longer in this world. and, it is with sadness that i think of them. i like this movie for the conversations and face expressions to it all. may this movie be blessed.",1
"so, i'm wondering while watching this film, did the producers of this movie get to save money on sandra bullock's wardrobe by dragging out her ""before"" clothes from miss congeniality? did ms. bullock also get to sleepwalk through the role by channeling the ""before"" gracie hart? as many reviewers have noted before, the film is very formulaic. add to that the deja vu viewer experiences with the character of cassie maywether as a somewhat darker gracie hart with more back story and it rapidly become a snooze fest.  the two bad boy serial killers have been done before (and better) in other films. as has the ""good guy partner trying to protect his partner despite the evidence"" character been seen before. in fact none of the characters in the film ever get beyond two dimensions or try to be anything but trite stereotypes.  one last peeve - using the term serial killer is false advertising. murdering one person - even if it's a premeditated murder - does not make you a serial killer. you may have the potential to become a serial killer but you are not a serial killer or even a spree killer.",0
"the clouded yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations. barry jones and kenneth more are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye. jean simmons is quite good, and trevor howard makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero.",1
"a nightmare on elm street: the dream child  this is a bad movie. there's no escaping it. i love the series and i think freddy is probably the best character ever in horror movies. but even being a fan i can't help but see this movie is mediocre.  there's not even an effort to build an interesting story and strong characters. by now they had just given up. they don't even try. they are the production of course, hoping for a few more easy dollars.  the story doesn't grab your attention. its so simple it's almost absent.  alice, a survivor from part 4 is now pregnant. freddy is coming back through the baby's dreams. at the beginning we learn that to stop him alice must find his mother. and that's it.   the story advances slowly since there's so little plot meaning it turns pretty boring after a few minutes of bad dialogues and awful acting. in fact that's the only scary thing, the acting, since the deaths are not even slightly cool.   the characters are so uninteresting we couldn't care less for them.  the girls are as unattractive as possible. the whole cast reminded me of a bad amateur theatre group. i've seen better actors in school plays. it's embarrassing really.  lisa wilcox still manages to bring some class to this. she is beautiful, sexy and has some talent. but the material just didn't let her shine. what a pity.  stephen hopkins work is nowhere close to renny harlin´s brilliant direction in dream master. he tries some imaginative shots near the end but that tension harlin and craven created so well in the previous movies is no where to be found.  the dream child is just another unimaginative sequel. it's the kind of movie that give horror series a bad name.   the end for the once scary freddy. it's too sad to see him now. a clown that's not funny. a bad joke. goodbye freddy.",0
"my main problem with the film is that it goes on too long. other then that, it's pretty good. paul muni plays a poor chinese farmer who is about to get married through an arranged marriage. luise rainer is a servant girl who gets married to muni. they live with muni's father on a farm and they are doing pretty bad. when he finally gets some money to buy some more land, a drought hits and nothing is growing. everybody stars to head north by muni stays behind at first. when they leave and arrive at town they find that their are no jobs and they are worse off than before. they even think about selling their youngest daughter as a slave for some money but decide against it. when a bunch of people start looting the town, the military show up and start executing people . paul muni does a good job and luise rainer won a second oscar for this movie.",1
"if i remember, ira gershwin, the lyricist and brother of george, offered the gershwin catalog for this film and it was snapped up by the producers. in many respects, it was a typical 50's movie musical by the freed unit at mgm and directed by vincente minelli with a lot of help from gene kelly.  the gershwins were, of course, among the greatest of all broadway musical teams but, in my opinion, george himself was among the greatest of all american composers, period!!! gene kelly was, of course, one of the two greatest male dancers of the movie musical (one guess as to the other?) and i don't imagine his casting was ever in doubt. but, i think the rest of the cast needs some explanation: oscar levant was a noted personality in his time and, as an actual friend of george gershwin, he had to be in this film. he was a talented pianist and even a moderately talented composer as well as a noted neurotic and hypochondriac and here, as always, he plays himself.  leslie caron was an unknown at this time and she was of the french ""gamin"" type. a talented dancer, she was never a real beauty. george guétary who plays the part of maurice chavalier, oops, i mean henri baurel, was greek and not french but he certainly is more than ok as a french boulevardier even if a little too young for the part.  gene's hoofer's voice is serviceable here but guétary has much the better vocal equipment. though gene was better cast elsewhere as, obviously, in ""singin' in the rain"" where his character is much more calculating, even here he shows himself to be something of a heel at times (he was, not for nothing, cast as the original heel joey in pal joey, the broadway musical.) i was not so enchanted with his ""i got rhythm"" scene with the children which does not appear as spontaneous as was intended in my opinion.  i also found nina foch's character milo to be rather irritating.  but the highlight of the film is obviously the lengthy ballet at the end of the film based on the title music with sets and costumes in the styles of the great french impressionist painters.  i found it difficult to believe gene and oscar, as struggling artists, and i don't think the musical numbers are as well set up as they might be but, on balance, the gershwin music is very well served in this film.  the dvd is well-done with fine clear graphics (when they are supposed to be) and the mono sound is good but a trifle shallow.",1
"tight script, good direction, excellent performances, strong cast, effective use of locations....  paul mcgann gives a detailed, subtle performance as the man in the centre of a new murder investigation who may just have committed a similar murder previously.  there is an interesting moral & emotional journey happening with his character (ben turner) and it intersects with the journey undertaken by amanda burton. inevitably they cross over... who has done what?  the examination of why, both in the past and in the present, rather than who might have yielded a more interesting, dostoyevskian story, but hey, who's complaining?

"ok, so, this is coming a few weeks late, but it is here. mostly, this is because of statements of various negative natures. starting with the technology. when star trek: tos ran, special effect technology was extreamely low tec, and more than that, the crew had little money to do any kind of proper mock ups. in the 35 years seince tos premiered, the crew of star trek have become experts at economy.  ultimately, they have decided, quite rightly in my mind, to abandon the look of tos and reverse engineered tng et all. so what if they decided not to make the transporter out of gold glitter or made the phase pistols look closer to the ones from star trek ii? as for the nits being picked about first contact with the klingon empire, it was presumed based upon comments made by kirk and riker that earth only met the klingon's in 2200. nothing was firmly established.  enterprise gives us the most promising venue of exploration that we've seen in a while. this is what voyager could have been. no series can evolve without a few inconsistancies, but be thankful that star trek has so few. so, quit gripping and enjoy.",1
"""raising victor vargas"" is one of those light, family movies that you can watch and do the n.y. times crossword puzzle at the same time. and if you want to go to the kitchen for a taco and a corona, you don't have to ""pause"" the dvd. just let it roll, 'cause you won't be missing anything really important. no twists, turns, or tension. it's not really an ethnic movie, it's a movie about a poor, struggling immigrant family that happens to be latino. they could have been any ethnic group. it made very little difference. i've seen it all a zillion times before. just plug in a jewish family, an italian family, a black family, or an irish family. just the accents and names were different. if the vargas family was named bush or clinton and were presbyterians, the movie would have been a total snooze.   it's funny that the critics here couldn't get the locale straight. some said it was spanish harlem. some the bronx, and another brooklyn. as a life-long new yorker, i vote for the lower east side. and it seemed that the family never met up with anyone except other latinos. they lived in an insulated/isolated little enclave. some interaction with non-latinos might have created some excitement, interest, or tension. remember west side story?  and now for the oft-criticized cinematography. i don't know if it was my tv or what, but all the indoor shots looked very orange to me. the apt, the furniture, and the faces were all orange. what was that supposed to mean? and the apt. did look pretty cramped to me. somebody here mentioned that the old apt's/tenements had very big rooms. well, maybe 50 years ago. what landlords have done is to break up one big apt into 2 or 3 very small ones and squeeze as many immigrants as they can into them.   and another annoying thing ....this is the second family movie i've seen and criticized this week that featured a teenage boy ""jerking off"". is this private sex act necessary for us to watch? please spare me! what's up with these directors?   so ""victor vargas"" is a pleasant little movie. it was nice for a change to see young latino actors given a break and a chance to show their talents, which they did. but the writers let them down, giving them a flat, unspectacular script to work with. enjoy the show, but keep your fingers near the ""fast forward"" button.",0
"i dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites. it was written by jay alan lerner and directed by vincent minelli. it won two academy awards for best picture of 1951 and best screenplay. the story of an american painter in paris who tries to make it big. nina foch is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him, but soon finds she loves the guy. meanwhile gene kelly falls for lovely damsel, leslie caron. his main dancing partner, and i must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise. famous french singer georges guietary sings, too. so if you like good smooth dancing and fun filled scenes filled with oscar levant's nimble piano fingers, the songs of george gershwyn will live on forever in this colorful gem. 8/10",1
"a movie made for contemporary audience. the masses get to see what they want to see. action, comedy, drama and of course sensuous scenes as well. this is not exactly a movie that one would feel comfortable watching with entire family. it isn't for eyes of children. i had to fast forward quite a number of scenes.  if it is just entertainment you are looking for, then this movie has it all. the songs are catchy. a lavish production, i must add.  however, the message of the movie is not universal. it emphasizes on the idea of karma. that is, if you do good, you will get good. and if you do evil, you will get evil. the fruit of good deeds is good, while the fruit of evil is evil.   in real life, this is not always true. it is well-known that most people do not get justice in this world. while it is true that some evil people do meet with an evil end, there are many who escape. and then, there are many people who do good, and yet in return they meet with a sorry end.  if you don't care about the message, and all you want is an escape from worldly reality, this movie is an entertainer alright.",1
"this film was recommended to me by a friend who lives in california. she thought it was wonderful because it was so real, ""just the way people in the ohio valley are!"" i'm from the area and i experienced the film as ""just the way people in california think we are!"" i've lived in marietta and parkersburg and worked minimum wage jobs there. we laughed a lot, we bonded with and took breaks with people our own age; the young people went out together at night. the older people had little free time after work because they were taking care of their families. the area is beautiful in the summer and no gloomier in the winter rain than anywhere else.  aside from the ""if you live in a manufactured home you must be depressed"" condescension, the story lacked any elements of charm, mystery or even a sense of dread.  martha's character was the worst drawn. it's doubtful that anyone so repressed would have belonged to a church, but if she had, she probably would have made friends there. i've read reviews that seem to assume martha was jealous of rose because rose was ""younger, prettier and thinner"" but if this is the case it isn't shown. all we actually see is martha learning to dislike rose for reasons that would apply just as much if the three friends had been the same age and gender. we see martha feeling left out during smoking sessions, left out of the loop when social plans are made, used but not appreciated, and finally disrespected and hurt.  just one more thing: are we supposed to suspect kyle of murder because he had once had a few panic attacks? please. this takes stigma against mental illness to a new level.",0
"for those who never saw a chorus line onstage and their only exposure to the story was this film, this film is ok as movie musicals, nothing special, just ok. i have seen the show on broadway 4 times and even auditioned for a touring company of the show once and for someone who pretty much memorized the original production, the 1985 film version is so dreadful on so many levels that i don't even know where to begin. first of all, for those who have never auditioned for a theatrical production, let me assure you that irl when you audition for a play, the director, producer, and choreographer never ask personal questions and don't give a crap about why you wanted to become a performer. a real theatrical audition, whether it be for a play or a musical, rarely takes more than five minutes. if you're auditioning as a dancer, you get shown a 64-bar dance combination once, you do it, and then they decide immediately whether you're in or out. michael bennett's original concept of the show was to flesh out the lives of dancers and introduce to the uninitiated the passion for performing and why so many sacrifice so much for so little. the play is about these dancers. first of all, director richard attenborough took so much focus off the dancers by beefing up the cassie/zach relationship and by casting michael douglas as zach. in the play, you never see zach...he is just a voice in the back of the theater and his relationship with cassie is barely touched upon. cassie shown in the cab in traffic trying to get to the audition and upstairs talking to larry (a character who is not even in the play)was all added for the movie and took so much focus off what the story is about. major musical numbers were cut or rethought. the opening number in the play ""i hope i get it"" shows all of the dancers doing a jazz and ballet combination and then people get eliminated. in the movie they jam three hundred dancers onstage together and show them in closeup to disguise the fact that they have cast people in the film who can't dance (can you say ""audrey landers""). ""goodbye 12, goodbye 13, hello love"", a brilliant vocal exploration of these dancers' childhood's jaundiced memories was reworked as ""surprise, surprise"" mainly a vehicle for the late gregg burge as richie. the show's most famous song, ""what i did for love"" which in the show was a touching allegory sung by the entire cast about what they give up to dance, becomes just another standard love song in the film, performed tiredly by a miscast allyson reed as cassie. jeffrey hornaday's choreography for the film is dull and unimaginative and doesn't hold a candle to michael bennett' original staging and when you're making a movie about dancers, the choreography has to be special. there are a couple of good dancers in the film, the previously mentioned gregg burge as richie, michelle johnston as bebe, and janet jones as judy, but they are hardly given the opportunity to show what they can do, yet audrey landers, who can barely walk and chew gum at the same time, is given one of the show's best numbers, ""dance 10, looks 3."" i will admit that the finale, ""one"" is dazzling, but you have to wait almost two hours for that. i would say that if you never saw a chorus line onstage, this film might be worth a look, but if you are a devotee of the original broadway musical...be afraid...be very afraid.",0
"i actually didn't enjoy this movie.  i saw it at a camp, and we didn't rave about it, we laughed at it. sure, some parts are touching, but the acting is terrible, the effects are terrible, and the whole overall movie idea is terrible (now, i know it was based on a book which i haven't read, but i hope that the book was better than this, because frankly, i thought that this movie was very bad and boring). like i said, i went to it with a bunch of people from a camp, and we were excited to be there, plus i got a caffeinated drink, but nonetheless, i struggled to stay awake. the only thing that kept me up (other than my fear of being embarrassed once i woke up) was the gunshots, that were quite pointless as well. i just really didn't like it.",0
"i cannot believe how bad this piece of garbage is! i want my $3.99 back! words defy description of this poorly made piece of crap! the dubbing in no way shape or form aligns with the actor's mouths. the movie looks like it was filmed with a 1970's vintage camcorder. i have shot better movies with my cell phone camera. the gore is laughable due to the silly unbelievable plot. the acting is what one would expect if you called all your friends over on a saturday afternoon and proceeded to get completely ripped, then tried to put on a play in your garage. don't get me wrong...i wasn't expecting o'neil and i love zombie movies, but the production values are so low in this film as to make it unwatchable. avoid!",0
"i recently watched belle epoque, thinking it might be wonderful as it did win an oscar for best foreign language film. i was a bit underwhelmed by the predictability and simplicity of the film. maybe the conflict i had was that from the time the movie was filmed to now, the plot of a man falling for beautiful women and eventually falling for the good girl has been done so many times. aside from predictability of the plot, some scenes in the film felt really out of place with the storyline (ex. a certain event at the wedding). at times the film was a bit preachy in it's ideas and in relation to the franco era the film was set in and the church. the only thing the film had going for it was the cutesy moments, the scenery, and the character of violeta being a strong, independent woman during times when women were not really associated with those characteristics.",0
"what a great barbara stanwyck film that i happened to see the other night. ""jeopardy"" was fantastic. it was made in 1953 and probably for double bills but it kept me on the edge of my seat.  barbara stanwyck plays helen, who with husband doug (barry sullivan) and son (lee aaker) drive to an isolated fishing spot in mexico for a vacation. husband has a fall from the jetty and the only way he is to be saved is if barbara drives back to a garage for some rope.  while there she runs into a psychotic killer (ralph meeker - one of my favourites) and what follows is a game of cat and mouse as barbara tries everything in her power to get meeker to come back with her to free her husband.  the film was so suspenseful and such a surprise - i was not expecting such a great film. but i suppose i should have realized - is there anything barbara stanwyck does that is anything less than wonderful?",1
"when my wife and i decided to watch this movie we thought it couldn't fail. i love billy crystal, my wife loves julia roberts and everyone we talked to said they loved it.  we were misled, in spades.  on my part, i felt billy crystal's character was extremely one-dimensional and did very little for the film. sure, he cracked a couple of good jokes, but as a character he did nothing but take up space.  and poor julia roberts. in past shows she plays well as a strong-willed, self-determined lady. in this flick, she seems completely repressed and had very little fire. this is not the julia roberts that my wife enjoys watching.  ok, if i were to find one good thing, it would have to be christopher walken. now that's entertainment. but, just like billy crystal, hardly anything is shown of his character.  if you're looking for a night of mindless laughs with very little redeeming value, go see it. but if you're looking for a smart, romantic comedy, this is not your film. it's none of the above.",0
"i guess this movie is a fitting tribute to the first superman film,as it is just as crummy and painfully long as the original.  after an opening scene consisting solely of murky intergalactic visuals, the credits pay homage to the even-crummy-looking-for-their-time futuristic sweeping credits of the original superman film.  then there is some more murky stuff. ma kent sees some kind of murky ruckus on the farm, and spends a good portion of my life slowly walking up to some debris in the cornfield. then superman sneaks up on her and faints.  next we catch up with lex luthor in a scene about many murky close-ups of an old lady as she dies. we don't see luthor's face until the end of the scene, an early instance of the film's drive to leave no hackneyed stone unturned. lex luthor is a guy who doesn't like superman because he is not human. also, he probably doesn't like humans either, as the movie occasionally features some kind of plot about lex luthor planning to kill most of earth's population.  after a while, clark kent shows up back at his old job (i forgot to mention, he had been away on a five year trip where nothing happened). then he finds out lois lane has an illegitimate kid and is dating cyclops. it upsets him so much that he loses control of his super strength to such an extent that he accidentally breaks a picture frame.  at this point we see that miss lane is on some kind of jet attached to some kind of space shuttle. it is some kind of important event on account of it is on television. then we learn that there are people in a control room monitoring this event. there are also people watching it on television and there are pilots in the cockpit. the film then reminds us that these people are involved by cutting between them for most of the summer.  as the events leading up to the inevitable disaster started to build, i excused myself to get a soda. i accidentally walked back into the wrong theater and watched that movie about al gore showing slides in its entirety. i tried to find my way back to superman returns, but i somehow wandered into prairie home companion, which i watched twice in a row. then it was time to stop messing around.  i walked back into the first theater, found my seat, and looked up to see that the impending lois lane space shuttle disaster was almost upon us. still, it seemed to be taking forever, so i wandered around the theater, met a girl, got married, raised a son and sent him off to college. while attending my son's medical school graduation, i remembered that i should probably check in on superman returns, so i excused myself and raced back to the theater only to learn there was no need to hurry. it still took about another half hour before things went wrong for space shuttle lane. when they did, superman saved everybody, which was pretty cool.  . and then there is a a subplot where superman turns really creepy and starts stalking lois lane and her family with his x-ray vision and super-hearing. then he tries to get her to cheat on cyclops, who seems like a good guy.  meanwhile, lex luthor is involved in some kind of contest to display every possible generic villain behavior before the end of the movie. i forgot to bring my scorecard home with me (they give you one at the door), but i think he scored damn close to one hundred percent. i hope he wins the million dollars.  at this point, things start to gear up for the big murky finale. i think maybe the projector was broken, on account of the movie seemed to be in some kind of loop for a while here. i remember seeing murky things growing out of the water, superman getting sick, superman getting better, back to the murky things, he's sick again, no wait, he's okay again.  then lex luthor unleashed his final bad guy move: yelling at his girlfriend a little bit.  then superman died and came back to life. i thought the movie was over, so i left.  ninety years later, the nursing home where i lived felt a little chilly. i realized i left my sweatshirt back in the theater, and i went to retrieve it. when i did, i was slightly surprised to find that superman returns wasn't over yet. i tried to ask some of the viewers what i missed, but most of them were only skeletons with long gray beards by now.  i sat back in my old seat and watched as lois lane puttered around her house for a while. then superman showed up and started quoting the beginning of the movie, and since i already saw that part i thought it was okay to leave.  so that is my review of superman returns.  oh, also, if you like jokes about people eating dogs or jokes about one dog eating another dog, you will love this movie. on account of there are two jokes like that in it.",0
"the rumor is true: girls like coyote ugly more than guys. and the reasons are obvious as soon as the plot is given. jersey girl goes to new york to become a song writer. and after initial frustration of having no luck, overhears some girls partying about the $300 each they made last night. she gets an audition at the bar they work at and surprise! the place is completely full of ""two year old toddlers"" bursting at the sight of babes dancing.  the story is not bad and some characters are likeable, especially cammie (the ""fashion coordinator"" part was cute) and the bouncer but let's face it, the drama was horrible and completely laughable from the beginning. violet and her father looked far too ridiculous while they were relating throughout the movie. and check out violet too jamming on that keyboard with the break dancer!  for the first time i could think of, how could the production be so terrible? for a brief moment with this movie, hollywood could stand on its two feet and show a new low without any major public outcry without saying, ""you were warned!"" instead, it seems coyote ugly has a purposeful intent on trying to kiss every major rear in the world. advertising babes in a bar, but showing a paper thin ""pursue your dream"" story disappointed every male teen you targeted!  and finally, the music. there was absolutely no break of music i found in this movie, especially when it was needed (the hospital scene). every scene felt like some short music video you just wish would stop until the bar opened. but the climax was an ultimate laugher: an '80s like song you would expect cyndi lauper to jump on the stage and jam with violet. heck, i personally thought bon jovi was going to jump out with the long hair and jam too!  other than some really smart camera work with the coyote girls when dancing (especially the wet scene), and a couple cute cliches, coyote ugly is something to be purely embarrassed about. whether you watched or made it, it looked like nothing but time killing. or wasting depending on how you look at it.",0
"may contain spoilers!!!! so i watched this movie last night on lmn (lifetime movie network) which is not known for showing quality movies. this movie is awful! i am still amazed that i watched the entire thing, as it was terrible. could this movie contain any more stereotypes? (harping jewish mother who wants son to be a doctor, catholic family with priest sons, big big crucifixes in every room shown in the catholic family's house, mexican whores, ""bad"" guy who is really a softie at heart, incredibly bad country accents) gag!!!! i was at first intrigued by the fact that i had never heard of this movie and after seeing that cheryl pollack and corin nemec were in it, i decided to stay awake until 4am to watch it. anyway, the only redeeming thing about this movie is madchen amick's beauty. i suppose pollack's and nemec's acting is okay, but they have a horrid script to work with. unlike the other reviewer who commented on the lack of texan accents (the movie is supposed to take place in austin and very few people there have a twang) i think that the accents were there (in supporting characters like mary margaret's date and john) and were unnecessary. they were also very very bad. i am so very tired of hollywood ""southern"" accents that sound nothing like the area where the accent is supposed to be from. and since it was supposed to take place in austin and shooting movies there in 1991 would not have been expensive, i fully expected there to be familiar shots of the town: the beautiful capitol building, the ut tower lit up for a winning football game, etc. none of these things were there. also, it takes about 5-6 hours to drive to mexico from austin. at one point in the movie, michael and his posse take off for mexico to lose their virginities and are able to drive off when it is dark (during the summer and early fall it doesn't get dark in austin until 9pm or so), spend time in mexico getting drunk and having sex with mexican (is there any other kind?) whores, and then return to austin by dawn. while this is theoretically possible it is not very likely. and if anyone has started school in the hill country (usually the third week of august, but may have been in september in 1960) they know that unless they want to pass out from heat stroke they do not wear their letter jackets!!!!! in august and september in austin and the surrounding areas it is 90+ degrees. only people with no body temperature would be stupid enough to wear sweaters or letter jackets on the first day of school. all in all, a very bad made for tv movie experience.",0
"this esteemed production has it's fans. but to paraphrase the classic bad review of 'mary reilly,' moby dick is like a painting, only slower.  this is because the philosophical grounds for a movie ""production"" are never to make a great film, rather it's to substitute the lack of a strong guiding idea (in this case for a books transference to film) with a list of hopelessly atomized, undynamic but dazzling conceits in an effort to trick viewers into thinking they've seen greatness. as viewers & critics are apt to fall for this, oscars follow, feeding the whole dumb equation.  i don't share in the pleasure all these reviewers found. moby dick is stunningly uninvolving. actors dutifully recite essays about jonah, moby dick, the ocean, moby dick, moby dick... all things that can't respond, and not one of which is absorbing in the slightest. it's dramatically inert. it doesn't build. in narrative terms moby dick (as a movie) is little more than a foregone conclusion in search of an actual story. after half an hour i was muttering ""oh terrific... another oath ...another 4 minute soliloquy!""  in the failed effort to involve you, it's a pretty campy overacting showcase. a lot of grey hair here. starbuck is supposed to be a golden god. (!)  one knows one is looking at a great director when he makes the medium his own rather than trying to replicate the feel of someone else's paintings & palette, or reverently embalming a classic as huston does here. paintings and books are nice but they're a different mediums. a movie like this fails to grasp that an honestly enjoyable piece of crap (village of the damned) is better in most respects than an insufferable piece of culture. this is the eat your vegetables school of film-making.  one appreciates the work that must have been done to make the movie, but not the narrative. only a few segments reflecting maritime research are interesting; the recording of shanties as a means of structuring work & various sea efforts; and the technology of whaling. and that doesn't call for a two-plus hour movie.",0

"omen iv (1991) was a bad made-for-t.v. movie. since the 80's were over, i guess the executives were experimenting in meth (the drug of choice during the 90's) because there is no other reason to explain this travesty. why did they even bother making this? a t.v. movie? what were they mulling over when this one came up on the idea board? did they even think for a second that this movie would catch on as. perhaps they thought it could make it as a series? we'll never know. but i know one thing. this movie was the major reason why i never bought the omen trilogy. they should have knocked off a couple of bucks instead of putting out this ""extra"" disc.  omen iv is basically a average american family remake of the first film. instead of a snot nosed punk kid, we get the spooky girl who's a total brat to everyone around her. if the family had stronger parenting skills, then none of the demonic events that have transpired in the past films would have never occurred. these parents need to put their foot down and do some real discipline!   not recommended, best to avoid at all cost!",0
"i was waiting to see this movie from a long time. it's promos gave a fair idea about the content and when i finally saw it, i really find it was quite well made. most of the conventional romantic movies end with the lovers finally getting married or start of with a happy life after marriage but there is really a great adjustment needed for this transition from an old life to a new relation and life. this is what this movie is all about the period when a newly wed couple fardeen and esha get married through an arranged marriage and start off their life with their honeymoon. the acting is really spell binding though i think esha remained a bit quiet and she could have used some lines for herself. the story was well knitted and dialogs were more or less appropriate. the editing and direction were also good, meghna gulzar really did a good job here. to summarize i would say it is a good drama cum romance, a true combination of what bollywood can offer a clean entertainer.",1
"i received this movie as a gift, i knew from the dvd cover, this movie are going to be bad.after not watching it for more than a year i finally watched it. what a pathetic movie.  i almost didn't finish watching this bad movie,but it will be unfair of me to write a review without watching the complete movie.  trust me when i say "" this movie sucks"" i am truly shocked that some bad filmmaker wane bee got even financed to make this pathetic movie, but it couldn't have cost more than $20 000 to produce this movie. all you need are a cheap camcorder or a cell phone camera .about 15 people with no acting skills, a scrip that were written by a couple of drunk people.  in the fist part of this ultra bad move a reporter (tara woodley )run a suppose to be drunk man over on her way to report on a hunted town. he are completely unharmed. they went to a supposed to be abandon house ,but luckily for the it almost complete furnished and a bottle of liquor on the door step happens to be there. just for the supposed to be drunk man but all is not what it seems.  then the supposed drunk man start telling tara ghost/zombies stories.  the fist of his stupid lame stories must be the worst in history.  his story  sgt. ben draper let one of his soldiers die of complete exhaustion (i think this is what happens)after letting the poor soldier private wilson do sit ups he let him dig a grave and then the soldier collapse ,ben draper  buries him in a shallow grave.  but sgt. ben draper are in for n big surprise. his wife/girl fiend knows about this and she and her lover kills sgt. ben draper to take revenge on private wilson.(next to the grave of the soldier he sort off murdered) the soldier wakes up from his grave in the form of zombie and kill them for taking revenge on his behalf.  the twist ending were so lame.  even if you like b horror movies, don't watch this movie",0
"while urban cowboy did not ooze with the same testosterone you might find at a rodeo, it did provide an accurate glimpse of that day and age, in urban texas. i also think that to truly critique this movie, one would have to have lived in the time and relative place that it was made. there was good music, fun times and, yes, a few ""rough and tumbles"" at the honky tonk roadhouses. the relationship of bud and sissy, like ""two ships passing in the night"", was well conceived. when pam tore up the note that sissy had written to bud, it echoed the tragedy of many true life romances. the entire story was well thought out. i thought the cast and crew did an excellent job. i thought the screen play was well written and directed. scott glenn should have received an oscar for best supporting actor.",1
"dear dear dear dear dear...me! i had the strength to see it through... but why?!  the first two films where fun and actually somewhat good. but this is so bad we had problems seeing the whole thing. this was some kind of tremors for kids. i can't believe this movie was made at all..seems like the props where taken from some bad western series of some kind (for kids) and they just did whatever they could with it.  what audience is this movie for? i can only think of 12-14 year olds. if you're older than 14 you'll have serious problems with this movie. it's not only slow, but it's so utterly boring. the characters are overacted (not just a little either) and so stereotyped it's fun for a while..but not long enough to not make you want to fling tomatoes at the screen. you know everything that is going to happen too, cause yes...you've seen it a billion times before in any hero series on tv for kids. i picked all the survivors and all the tremor fodder the second the characters got introduced. it's so bad..so wrong..so...crap.  but ok, we did get a laugh now and then. not just at the silly plot holes, but some scenes where worth a replay or two...or one scene that is, where two baby tremors fling themselves at one of the obvious tremor fodder guys..it's really a great scene which made us replay it over and over and laugh wholeheartedly. still makes me grin when i think about it. but that only happened one more time sadly..and that's when the ""badass"" gunman shows up and overacts his part wonderfully...that and one comment ""they spring from the ground like some demonic trout!"" at this point we where almost crying with laughter. but after that..nothing could ever top that..(?)..so it's pretty much downhill from there.   so tops here are demonic trouts and overacting. if anybody ever tells you this is a good movie...he's either a ""plant"", vegetable or someone very evil. this movie has got to be the worst of the tremors by far. looking forward to seeing tremors 3, it's bound to be box office hit compared to this...this...*goosebumps* no..i'll leave it at that.",0
"few movies can be viewed almost 60 years later, yet remain as engrossing as this one. technological advances have not dated this classic love story. special effects used are remarkable for a 1946 movie. the acting is superb. david niven, kim hunter and especially roger livesey do an outstanding job. the use of black and white / color adds to the creative nature of the movie. it hasn't been seen on television for 20 years so few people are even aware of its existence. it is my favorite movie of all time. waiting and hoping for the dvd release of this movie for so many years is, in itself, ""a matter of life and death"".",1

"oh, this is so bad, it is funny. the only way one could explain something like this is a porn party with drugs that resulted in the resolution to make a movie just for fun. i mean: you get to see porn actresses topless, having sex, then killed by human mutants. there is plenty of gore, including the classic ""something is wrong with her, oh no, it's half the person she used to be"" and the accidental murder caused by panic. but you can also find funny stuff like intestines pulled through someone's ass and a guy running in the woods then finding himself decapitated by a wire tied between two trees (that makes a metallic doiiing sound afterward, like in cartoons). somehow there is a market for people going beyond porn, they really need to know what's inside an actress, mere genitals are not enough. therefore you get to see plenty of summary autopsies on slain bimbos. there is no dialog. jenna and chasey have really small parts and i really wonder what richard grieco wanted when accepting a role here. i think this is a film one must watch with the button on fast forward and watch only the juicy stuff, just to be reminded of the old school c class horror movies.",0

"well, for starters, this actually was the most elegant clausen film to this date.  the man's always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them, but i think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything he's made earlier. his work has - in very black n' white words - been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience, and we've always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to say.  in ""villa paranoia, however, for the first time, he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities. not only the ethnic but also the normal people you tend to forget. set in jutland - in 'the country' - it deals with the everlasting issue of lack of love, but in a close and at times brutal way that keeps you looking and keeps you focused. and on top of that, he himself manages to play a b******d! a true b*****d, who wants the right thing but has no clue how to get there, and people therefore suffer. bitterly.   i'd have to say it's one of the best movies i've seen this year and i'm greatly anticipating his next.",1
"a hard to find film which coasts on the still pervasive mythology of senator joe mccarthy as a political demon king. boyle (as joe) gives a compelling but historically inaccurate portrayal of the wisconsin senator, the caricature mccarthy many take as the real one. meredith, as wily army lawyer joseph welch, who outsmarted mccarthy at the army hearings in 1954, is very good, as always.  in fact, mccarthy and cohn were quite right in worrying about the appalling security situation in the army, and the 1954 army hearings became enmeshed in the smokescreen used by the army to deflect the investigation away from their security failings, which the committee were investigating, by counter-charging that mccarthy and cohn were trying to get favours for their staffer, david schine, whilst in the service.  the film is self satisfied agenda driven polemic, based in the pervasive myths which have passed for the truth with many people for decades-that the ""red scare"" was essentially phony and mccarthy, huac etc were always blasting away at the wrong targets, being no more than lying, career ruining publicity hounds, who were trampling over the constitutional rights of startled innocent liberals, who were accused of being security risks/communists.  people who know little about the matter still feel confident in repeating misinformation on mccarthy and the ""red scare"" to this day-clooney's murrow hagiography is an example. the misinformation is pervasive, no wonder people have swallowed it. a recent obit of budd schulberg in the serious left wing uk newspaper ""the guardian"" headlined that the hollywood writer ""named names"" ""to mccarthy""- perpetuating the lie that mccarthy ""investigated"" hollywood as head of huac-the truth being that mccarthy was never even a member of huac and he had little interest in the politics of hollywood types-his investigations were confined almost exclusively to arms of the us government.  the mythology about the ""red scare"" being baseless is now completely exploded by recently opened soviet and us government documents, if anything mccarthy and co underestimated the sheer scale of soviet and fellow traveller infiltration in the us, but decades of public misinformation about this period will be hard to correct.  one day maybe some really brave hollywood soul will make a movie telling the truth about how many american men and women clandestinely aided the mass murderer stalin, and worked to impose his vicious system of government on the western world, giving an accurate account maybe of joe mccarthy's career-but i won't hold my breath. till then, we have this mythical, drunken lying scoundrel of popular imagination so familiar in the media....""tail gunner joe"".",0
"the house of the spirits is a gripping tale of family intrigue, south american politics and super-natural powers. meryl streep, glenn close and jeremy irons bring isabel allende's novel to life with all its passion and suspense. this, in my view, is one of the best films of the 1990s. jeremy irons as esteban trueba ages and mellows very believably, while meryl streep in the role of clara maintains her gentle, loving warmth throughout her relatively short life. winona ryder and antonio banderas make a handsome couple struggling for family acceptance in a racist culture. glenn close, as esteban's sister, gives a very moving performance. the countryside of portugal is a reasonable substitute for a non-tropical latin american country. settings of clara's home and esteban's ranch are effective and the period us cars add nicely to the post-war atmosphere.",1
"if you ""get it"", it's magnificent.  if you don't, it's decent.  please understand that ""getting it"" does not necessarily mean you've gone through a school shooting. there is so much more to this movie that, at times, the school shooting becomes insignificant.  above all, it's a movie about acceptance, both superficially--of a traumatic event, but also of people who are different for whatever reason.  it's also a movie about unendurable pain, and how different people endure it. in this case, the contrast between alicia's rage and deanna's obsession creates an atmosphere of such palpable anxiety that halfway through the movie we wonder how the director could possibly pull a happy ending out of his hat. thankfully, the audience is given credit for being human beings; our intelligence is not insulted by a sappy, implausibly moralistic ending.  above and beyond that, i try to keep a clear head about movies being fiction and all that. yet i must admit, i cried like a lost little baby during this movie. there were certain things about it that hit *very* close to home and opened up some old wounds that never quite healed. but that is not necessarily a bad thing.",1

"in this strangely-lackadaisical apocalypse, the world suffers from a dual plague of zombies and vampires, but no one seems to be too worried about it in this grade-z film which bares less resemblance to sheridan le fanu's famous short novel than my mother's lasagna recipe. bored attendants still run gas stations and doctors still make house calls and helpful police officers still show up with radiator fluid just when you need it. the plot, and i use that term loosely, involves a father and a daughter trying to rendevous with ""the general,"" whose daughter is missing, at a church to kill a vampire who, very conveniently, happens to be traveling with the father and daughter. i must confess that a moment or two of genuine humor can be found between vast stretches of unintentional humor. the film also boasts just enough nudity to keep a boy of fourteen interested. anyone older beware.",0

"there is something special about the austrian movies not only by seidl, but by spielmann and other directors as well. this is the piercing sense of reality that never leaves the viewer throughout the movie. hundstage is no exception. this effect is achieved not only by the depicted stories but also by actors playing. in hundstage i have never had the feeling that these are actors playing, but real people instead. so real is the visceral feeling of the viewer...almost as if the grumpy pensioner or lonely lady in the movie are living below you in your block.  any person living in vienna can without any doubt painfully recognize the people in the movie with their meckern/sudern (complaining), their hidden sexual urges and the prolo macho guys. this is further reinforced by the viennese dialect which is, according to many, especially made for complaining as a way of life. a special parochialism and arrogance typical for vienna are also very well portrayed.  the viennese suburbs have a vivid presence in the movie with their stupor and drowsiness where nothing happens. moreover, they have been turned into a celebration of materialism with shopping malls and huge department stores. inbetween are the houses of the people where they indulge into what they reckon is pleasure-giving activities, trying to stay in touch with their human selves, yet in vain. the examples are the sexual game of the old lady with the men which bordered on rape, the prolo guy losing his nerves and hitting his girlfriend and the young woman who hitchhikes and irritates her drivers.  the film has no soundtrack as it concentrates on the normality/abnormality of its images only. another typical feature of seidl (and other austrian directors) is his showing of disturbingly sexual images. these include the stripping of the old woman for her husband, the sexual scenes in the bath, the sexual game of the lady with the two men in her apartment, etc.  in hundstage seild has portrayed the lives of people who eventually may be as much viennese as they could be citizens of paris, new york or madrid. the viewers should not despise or feel pity for the viennese in the movie as they themselves could become victims of the same human estrangement and alienation, albeit in different circumstances. in the end, i believe seidl's film is a warning to us about the terrible state of human relationships so brutally revealed in hundstage. and if the viewer does not succumb to the reasons for this evil transformation, seidl has achieved his goal.",1
"i have recently watched this movie twice, and i can't seem to understand why the h*ll the makers made this pile of crap. i mean, yes, it gives a great impression of hitler's environment, and i mean the way they reproduced austria in the late 1890's, wwi and the inter-war period. what i can't understand is why they pictured hitler as a 100% pure evil, mad, unreliable, mentally unstable freak. he was after all a very thoughtful, loving and intelligent man who of course had his dark sides, no doubt about that. but why in heaven's name portray him in this way? all of his positive aspects have been cut out of the scenario, leaving nothing but a very propaganda-like portrait of a man who had the biggest influence on modern civilization ever. yes, he threw germany into the devastating 2nd world war. yes, he was racist, and yes he was at times menially unstable especially at the end of the war. all true. but again; why the hell did they plain lie to the public? to warn us?  i absolutely don't think this movie was a warning. the true danger of hitler and the nazi's was the fact they were able to rise to power at moments of severe global weakness. the fact this evil was so recognizable yet so embraced by almost every german alive (not to mention austrians and a lot of other people) makes it a warning to modern civilization, not the fact hitler was such a 'weirdo'. if it would have been like the makers make us believe - i would have been convinced that the german people were retarded. a man like the one in this movie would have never gotten anywhere near party leader - not to mention reichskanzler.   4/10",0
"this british film is truly awful, and it's hard to believe that glenn ford is in it, although he pretty much sleepwalks through it. the idea of a bomb on a train sounds good...but it turns out this train ends up parked for the majority of the film! no action, no movement, just a static train. the area where the train is parked is evacuated, so it's not like there's any danger to anyone either. in fact, this film could be used in a film class to show how not to make a suspense film. true suspense is generated by letting the audience know things that the characters don't, a fact apparently unknown to the director. spoiler: the train actually has two bombs on it, but we are led to believe there is only one. after the first bomb is defused, it feels as if there is no longer a reason to watch the film any more. but at the last minute, the villain, who has no apparent motivation for his actions, reveals there are two. nor are we certain when the bombs will go off, so we don't even have a classic ""ticking bomb"" tension sequence. a good 10 minutes or more are spent watching glenn ford's french wife thinking about leaving him, and then wondering where he is . she's such an annoying character that we don't care whether she reconciles with him, so when she does, there's nothing emotional about it. most of the other characters are fairly devoid of personality, and none have any problems or issues. it's only 72 minutes, but it feels long because it's tedious and dull. don't waste your time.",0
"tough guys, sexy women, lots of swearing, and a most unconvincing monster that rises from the depths of a polluted lake. you'd think ""monster"" would be fun...but it isn't, really. it does star tony eisley and john carradine, however, and in my book that makes it worth viewing at least once. in an interview with ""fangoria"" in 1987, eisley recalled that herbert strock had directed the bulk of the film, but somehow kenneth hartford--who only directed the footage featuring his children andrea and glenn (portraying characters named andrea and glenn, in a particularly inventive turn)--received full credit. considering how awful the end result was, strock was probably glad that he hadn't been credited! ""monster"" has the look and feel of a mid-to-late-seventies tv movie, which is why i like to leave it on in the background every so often. as entertainment it falls flat on its face, but as a reminder of another age and a vanished type of film-making, it's very effective. the only thing that's missing is a car chase.",0

"(spoilers)wow, this is a bad one. i did a double take when watching an old star trek episode the other day-it was the one where everyone gets infected with that space sickness and then go a bit nuts-and there was stewart moss, a.k.a the unlikable 'hero' of it lives by night! he played the first crewmember infected, who dies from terminal depression. all i could think was that he'd watched his own movie too many times, that's what caused the depression. this movie is full of truly unlikable people. there is no redeeming character in the film, not one. it's very hard to feel bad about dr. beck's turning into a bat(or whatever he actually turned into), because you just don't like him. and you don't like his shrill, bony wife, or the nasty sleazy sgt. ward, or dr. mustache love...so why would you invest any time or energy in this movie? where there is no empathy with the characters, there is no reason to bother caring about it. not to mention the horrible cinematography, which made it look like they'd filmed the movie through urine, and the five cent bat special effects, many of which appeared to be pieces of paper thrown into a fan to simulate hordes of bats flying. not the worst film i've ever seen on mst3k, but down there in the bottom ranks, definitely.",0
"as if there weren't enough of those floating around at the time already, we have here another lame godfather clone from the director of il consigliori (1973) which i had watched earlier this year. the marquee-value name roped in this time is telly savalas who belatedly enters the proceedings and is first seen from behind, rather campily tending to his flowers and wearing a beret in the style of french painters! apart from not looking minimally sicilian, he sports no accent of any kind other than his familiar drawl. antonio sabato, then, makes for an unlikely gangster - apart from being a resistible leading man; his relationship with savalas, which becomes paternal at the flick of an eye, is also unconvincing (especially since he subsequently becomes romantically involved with the latter's spirited teenage niece)! besides, for a gangster flick, there's precious little action to speak of and none of it is in any way memorable (though the finale set in a clinic is well enough handled); furthermore, the score by francesco de masi is serviceable but nothing else. incidentally, the bargain-basement dvd i rented starts off midway through the credits so that none of the cast members - or even the film's title - is ever listed!",0

"ho, ho, homicidal maniac! this spirited tour-de-force adaptation of a great ec comics horror tale is undoubtedly one of the best episodes of the cable tv series ever made. director robert (""back to the future"") zemeckis makes the most out of a witty script by fred (""night of the creeps,"" ""the monster squad"") dekker which centers on a ruthless two-timing housewife (well played by mary ellen trainor, who was married to zemeckis when she starred in this episode) who kills her jilted jerk of a husband (a nice cameo by marshall bell) on christmas eve by whacking him upside the head with a fire-poker. complications ensue when a deranged murderous madman dressed up as jolly kris kringle escapes from a nearby asylum and decides to pay trainor a decidedly unfriendly visit. alan silvestri's spooky, stirring score and dean cundey's typically polished cinematography further enhance the macabre fun. and larry drake (the sweet gentle giant benny on ""l.a. law""!), with his creepy hiccuping guffaw, a demented twinkle in his bright green eyes, and a leering, truly wicked grin, makes for a sensational sanguinary saint nick.",1

"if there's one thing that annoys me most in seeing a bad film, it's seeing it done by experienced film-makers who ought to know better. this ""re-imagining"" of planet of the apes could have used some imagination, to say nothing of essential elements of character development. nova, the girl in the original planet of the apes, was a better developed character than daena in this version, for all that she does not say a single word. one certainly expected a lot better from tim burton, a man who has hitherto combined an incredible visual imagination with intelligence, wit and humour, all of which were notably absent from this production.  there were problems in basic plot development. the first big mistake was allowing the humans to talk. this was the fundamental difference between apes and men that made *all* the difference in the original film. even while he was mute, his ability to communicate was what marked out heston's taylor as being different from the other humans. in the current film, mark wahlberg encourages the (talking) human slaves to revolt, but there is no overpowering reason for them to have not revolted and reclaimed their emancipation already. they are dexterous tool-users and have the ability to communicate in order to form plans, something mute humans can't do. it needs no man to fall from the stars to save them. indeed, since he comes from a technological civilisation and finds himself in a pre-technology era without (at first) any gadgets to help him, it is wahlberg who ought to be at a disadvantage, not the humans who are used to living there.  it was sad to see helena bonham carter working so hard to generate some kind of spark between herself and that unresponsive brick wall mark wahlberg. her best scenes were with the villainous tim roth.  the humans were practically ignored until they were needed in the third act, at which point daena started showing some actual interest in davidson (wahlberg), and a young boy suddenly changed from part of the background to a feisty gung-ho freedom-fighter. this was poor character development. (estella warren, in particular, looked as if she would have been capable of a great deal more than she was given in the script). wahlberg's puzzlement at the end as to what these humans see in him was certainly shared by me, as he has scarcely interacted with the humans throughout.  creating the apes: half a plus point and two minuses: ape make-up was excellent on the males, particularly michael clarke duncan who has incredibly expressive eyes (which was why he was so good in the green mile), and the makeup design allowed him to use them fully. but the ape females looked like nothing on earth, neither ape nor human. the minuses were the ape jumps which looked about as realistic as flash gordon's rocket: jumping apes looked as if they'd just been fired from a catapult, they had none of the long-limbed grace of genuine apes. secondly, the poor sound mixing - when the gorillas roar it is quite clearly dubbed from some animal, probably feline, making them sound ridiculous and unrealistic.  in the original film, the various ""human"" things the apes do and say are handled as light relief (""i never knew an ape i didn't like."" ""human see, human do!""). here, the apes just talk matter-of-factly exactly as 21st century humans do, and there is no humour in it at all. the only genuinely original idea was ari writing with her feet.  nothing made me cringe more than the ""v-ger from star trek"" moment near the end of the film. first of all, the apes had apparently been able to read roman lettering in the distant past, for them to know the name of the forbidden zone in its partly concealed form. secondly, the mysterious inscription giving the name is merely covered with sand which wahlberg just brushes away, something any ape could have done centuries ago. this moment was, for me, far worse than the much-maligned ending of the movie.  things of that nature, however, are typical of most science fiction movies of today. back in the '60s and '70s, they generally didn't have the budget to make convincing futuristic sets, but they dealt with genuinely original themes and ideas which were truly science fictional. i'm thinking of 2001: a space odyssey, the 1967 planet of the apes, thx1138, soylent green, silent running and the 1972 solaris. the first planet of the apes even utilised the only scientifically valid and physically possible method of travelling forward in time. however, this film includes just about every bad science fiction cliché going: space storms, anomalies and worm holes straight out of star trek; the planets of the solar system and their moons apparently all visible together as large globes (in reality from any one planet, all other bodies, even their own moons, are just points of light); a conventional rocket powered shuttle travelling from saturn to earth in a matter of minutes instead of years; two-thousand year old equipment firing up and fully working the minute the hero presses the button. to say nothing of a conveniently bulletproof internal glass door. in a contemporary setting, you'd have to explain *why* it was bullet proof, but because it's ""science fiction"" you don't have to!  overall, burton's most disappointing film.",0
"final score (an average of various classic cinematic qualities- acting, visuals, creativity, payoff, humor, fun, ect):  4.3 (out of 10)  had ""atlantis: the lost empire"" come out a few years ago it would have seemed like a bold, serious new direction in disney animation. however, it comes just a year after the innovative and nearly genius ""the emperor's new groove"" and marks a step back in freeing disney from it's repetative ""disney formula"". i'm a big fan of the feature length disney animated films. have to see them all love it or hate it. ""atlantis"" is an animated throwback to ""20,000 leagues under the sea"" and similar live-action sci-fi adventures of the 50s and 60s. problem is that this version hardly contains one original idea. it feels like a remake of something, even more so than actual disney remakes(tarzan, the hunchback of notre dame). the characters are little more than a walking cliches of the usual suspects that typically populate these type of films (the oddball mechanic, the gung ho general, the sassy tough women). beyond milo thatch (fox) and rourke (garner) the supporting cast is flat-out obnoxious. the movie also suffers from it's succinct pace. instead of fleshing it out into an epic story, disney jams a lot in the usually brief running time brushing over opportunities to develop...suspence, characters, anything really. they thow us into this new and wonderous world and barely let us get our barings. the awkward pace sometimes makes confusing what is a relatively simple story. the animation is dark and dreary and cheap. this thing looks like a slapped together saturday morning cartoon. let's hope they haven't forgotten that 2d traditional animation can still be wonderous. ""the iron giant"" among others proved that.  negatives: the visuals, pace, and sheer lack of originality.  positives: quite possibly the coolest death scene for a disney villain in a long time. it's the creative highlight of the movie.",0
"to be honest, i didn't watch all of the original 'howling', but those scenes i saw made it obvious that the first howling was a great movie. so great, that seven horrible sequels had to be made. they started off with ""howling ii: your sister is a werewolf"". i got this movie on vhs from my uncle sometime ago when he was giving away a bunch of old movies he bought back when atari was brand new. i just watched it last night, and it wasn't really bad, it was just weird. i mean, the whole thing with sybil danning going three-way with two of her werewolf minions was just out of place and quite disturbing (but kinda hot), christopher lee about to stab a dead karen as if she's a vampire, etc. actually, this movie was actually like some sort of mish-mash of dracula and the lost boys...except with werewolves, because everything christopher lee (whom played dracula himself) was saying about werewolves pretty much ripped off from every other vampire movie (stake in the heart, garlic, the creature of the night must die at night, and the ruler of werewolves lives in transylvania). not much for the acting, but the worst of it came from annie mcenroe. i swear, at some point in the film i found myself rooting for the werewolves to rip her throat out, because that damn throat always had to say something. anyway, the plot is pretty silly and clichéd, so there's no real point in telling you, you could just read about it on wikipedia. by the way, the thing that really makes me nauseous about this movie is the fact that it's the only film out of all the seven sequels thats related in any way to the original (not counting howling iv (1988), which was a remake of the original, or in other words, a sequel based on the same novel). so don't see this movie. there's no real horror, hardly any werewolves, and just horrible special fx. 3/10",0
"i have never understood the appeal of this show. the acting is poor (debra jo rupp being a notable exception), the plots of most episodes are trite and uninspiring, the dialogue is weak, the jokes unfunny and it is painful to try and sit through even half an episode. furthermore the link between this show and the '70s' is extremely tenuous beyond the style of dress and the scenery and background used for the show -it seems to be nothing more than a modern sitcom with the same old unfunny, clichéd scripts that modern sitcoms have dressed up as depicting a show from twenty years ago in the hope that it will gain some nostalgic viewers or something like that. both ""happy days"" and ""the wonder years"" employ the same technique much more effectively and are actually a pleasure to watch in contrast to this horrible, pathetic excuse for a show",0
"first off, the movie was not true to facts at all. i just saw the documentary a few days earlier and the movie wasn't anything like it. first of all nash was a genius at mathematics and this is what the movie should have been about not a story about a man who was cured and who found love at the end and so on. also there are a lot of scenes that were just plain wrong - the scene where he rode around with a bike at the campus happened in his early university years not after it. in my opinion russell crowe didn't fit to this part at all since he doesn't look the intelligent/individualist type, therefore he really couldn't play one. it would have been great if it would have focused more on the mathematics (similar to pi) and not the over-dramatized lovelife. at this level abm was too hollywood-ish and too superficial to be great. personally i think he wasn't mad nor paranoid and he was onto something since people of that caliber tend to know more than we ""lesser mortals"". 5/10",0

"this agonizing comedy-drama got surprisingly sterling reviews upon its release in 1979. i remember opening the movie-section of the l.a. times and looking at a 2-page advertisement for ""chapter two"" filled with glowing captions like: ""better than 'the goodbye girl'!"" and ""neil simon does it again!"" what does neil simon do? he takes an autobiographical situation (remarrying too soon after the death of a beloved spouse) and makes it rusty, unpleasant and--worst of all--unfunny. james caan plays neil--er..that is, george--a writer who can't seem to get back into life after losing his wife; enter spirited marsha mason (real-life mrs. simon...soon to be ex-mrs. simon) who attempts to love george despite his moods and general melancholy. mason is very appealing here and might've saved the day were it not for caan's indifference (not to mention a sub-plot concerning painfully-thin, blonde valerie harper which brings the proceedings to a screeching halt). i liked mason's outburst at the end (""i am wonderful! i am nuts about me!""), but i saw no happy ending for these two people...and time proved me right. ** from ****",0
"i really don't want to compare martin scorsese's cape fear to the classic 1962 cape fear film, but i can't help it. not only am i a huge fan of the robert mitchum and gregory peck starred cape fear, but when scorsese includes scenes right out of the previous film (cady taking the keys out of the ignition, dog dying) and even using bernard herrmann's score throughout the entire film, he's not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as i can't help but think of the classic cape fear nearly every scene. when comparing scorsese's version of cape fear to the classic version, the remake comes out destroyed by the classic; but even when taking the film by itself, it's still bad.  now scorsese and screenwriter wesley strick didn't just remake the 1962 cape fear scene for scene, they tried to do things differently. unfortunately this is one of the film's problems. gone is the original crazy and animal-like max cady who is out for personal revenge, the max cady in the 1991 version is a religious fanatic out to ""save"" sam bowden and who is in touch with his feminine side (his words, not mine). also gone is the stand-up and strong sam bowden seen in the classic cape fear film, the sam found in the 1991 remake is very goofy, magoo, distrustful, and very unlikable. even mrs. bowden is a completely different character - she's crazier than max cady is! the overall story has also been changed around - sam didn't testify against cady in court to put him in jail like in the classic version, sam is now cady's ex-lawyer who cady suspects of not doing all he could to keep him out of jail and is out to ""save"" him.  the overall story has been changed, and i don't hold too much against it, but the overall script is also weak all around. other sub-plots have been thrown into the mix that not only distract from the bigger picture, they are also just poorly written. the film also includes a few frankly absurd scenes and is filled with apathetic and even ridiculous lines that you can't take the least bit seriously. these aspects take away from the dangerous and thrilling nature that the film is supposed to have, but they have some help in this department as well.  now the classic version of cape fear was extraordinarily filmed with brilliant lighting and a powerfully effective suggestive subtlety combined with a barefaced brutality that delivered thrills when the film called for it and a sense of danger throughout its entirety. however, scorsese is unable to do any of this in his cape fear, giving the film a cookie-cutter early 1990s look, no sense of danger, no suspenseful scenes, and little style (unless you count animating fire and the skyline style). yeah, there is some gruesome violence and some effort was put in to make this cape fear bigger than the original, but it ends up empty and all shock but no awe.  if all that wasn't enough, the acting isn't great either. robert de niro (being somehow nominated for an academy award for his performance) starts off alright as max cady, but he gets progressively worse until he begins to get nothing but laughs instead of scares by the end of the film. the opposite thing happens for jessica lange and her performance of mrs. bowden, going from overacting for most of the film to giving a convincing display of fear and desperation towards the end. as sam bowden, nick nolte stays the same throughout the whole film: beige. juliette lewis (who also reeled in an academy award nomination) is decent enough in her role as danielle bowden, but she's called upon to play a real stupid character and it's hard to really like what we see on screen from her.  this film seems to be often counted as one of the few good remakes, and i can't figure out why. i wanted to like it; i really did - i mean, if there's going to be a remake of cape fear i'd rather like that one too - but i just couldn't. containing nothing to be great on its own and being crushed by the unavoidable comparison to the original cape fear, i found martin scorsese's cape fear to be a very bad film indeed. the best things about the film are robert mitchum and gregory peck in their supporting roles - go figure.",0
"this film was absolutely brilliant!! every performance in this film is excellent, especially jake gyllenhaal and chris cooper. it looks like mr gyllenhaal will have a huge film career if this is anything to go by. i thought that joe johnston was an odd choice as director as he is usually associated woth big budget blockbusters(jumanji, honey i shrunk the kids). he pulls of every scene with sheer class. my favourite scene was where homer is going down the mineshaft and looking at the sky, going down, as all of his dreams were, it was beautiful. joe johnston should direct more of these brilliant, acting driven films as well as his big budget blockbuster faire, which is also excellent. kudos!! to all involved in this masterpiece!",1
"title: robot jox (1990)   director: stuart gordon   cast: gary graham, anne marie johnson, paul koslo   review: stuart gordon who we usually associate with extremely gory horror films such as re-animator, from beyond, dagon and castle freak, took a small detour here and did a little sci-fi flick. i stress the word ""little"" since this is a very low budget flick, and there in lies its main weakness.  the story takes place in the future. a world in which the great superpowers (that according to this movie are the united states and russia) duke out their differences not by going on a full blown world war...but by fighting gladiator style battles with gigantic robots. our hero achilles must go up against the evil russian robot fighter called alexander. lots of cheap stop motion animation ensues.  well, the idea is awesome i guess. the great nations settleling territorial disputes with giant robots? interesting premise and one that could have been handled properly if the proper budget had been available. unfortunately what could have been a fun movie ends up being an embarrassment for an otherwise great director.  i as a kid loved this movie, and i guess if you want any enjoyment out of this movie, you'll have to revert back to little kid mode to have some fun with it. i showed this film to some of my friends and as the movie progressed my friends where like ""what the hell is this piece of crap franco?"" and i'm like well this movie is a sci-fi by one of my favorite directors stuart gordon?"" but as the movie progressed into corny territory i almost felt like pressing stop and not having them go through that torture. i could go through it, cause i loved this film as a kid, and there's still a little nostalgia attached to watching it. but everyone else was just not going to get it.  and i myself realized that the movie isn't really that good. first off. the movie is about giant robots kicking the hell out of each other. and in order to achieve this in a credible fashion you'd have to use some damn good special effects to make it work, expensive effects that would help us the audience suspend disbelief. but unfortunately this being a small scale movie, from a small scale company (empire pictures, which went bankrupt after making this film!)the effects only help us giggle and laugh at them. heck even the sets and some of the wardrobe looks unfinished or half assed.  ok granted, once you accept that you are watching a mixture of moderate stop animation and miniatures well you can sort of give in to the film and even enjoy the big robots kicking the hell out of each other. there are certain scenes when the robots are fighting that are kinda cool, and made me go ""thats why i liked thid movie!"" but every know and them, some crappy effect will take you right out of that protective little cocoon you were trying to hide in. and boom, your right back into realizing this film just doesn't live up to its premise.  and heres another thing that sort of bothered me a bit about the movie. this movie is basically a movie for kids. you know, giant robots duking it out? stop motion animation? hello? but this movies dialogue had a lot of sexual innuendos and the violence gets a little bloody. so i kept asking myself is this a kids movie or not? after a while i just came to the conclusion that basically this was a kids movie with adult sensibilities, which really isn't a good mix.  so for those of you who don't feel that certain naive childlike charm of watching two robots fighting each other and if you don't have a nostalgic connection to this movie (like i do) well id suggest you steer clear away from this one. gordons a great director, but this movie he made, just didn't do it for me. well, at least not now that i'm a full grown adult.  rating: 2 out of 5",0
"thhe remake was a superior movie remake in every way. most remakes end up being total garbage but under the very talented direction of alexandre aja became one of the best ever made in terms of remakes and also as far as the mutant inbreed human sub-genre of horror is concerned. in steps part 2 directed by another individual martin weisz and written by the father and son combo of jonathan and wes ""i cannot make a good horror movie to save my life anymore"" craven and if this is any indication of weisz directing skills and young craven's writing skills we are all in for a painful future as thhe 2 not only fails to be as good as the first but also fails to entertain on any level.  we start off with a fairly graphic mutant baby birth which though is rather cool will not prepare you for the utter garbage that is to come, only hint to what could have been in this film. we then get to see a crew of scientists who all to briefly are introduced and dispatched by our radiated rejects. in steps our main cast of army reservist to save the day, this is where the major problems begin.  from very sub par acting (yes even for this kind of movie) to the horrible characters to the lack of true carnage for most of its running time thhe 2 becomes a labor to watch as a lot of nothing happens as idiotic soldiers make mistake after mistake only to meet there demise not by the mutants but themselves. think the marines in aliens only the exact opposite and you have the idea of how well these soldiers are trained. this is the true shame of the film as most of the hills occupants do not get the kills you would like to see, like in the first film, in fact if this did not have thhe 2 attachment in the beginning and the brief overview in the beginning tying this loosely to the first this could have nearly been a sci-fi channel original.  the mutant mountainbillies as well are not as amusing this time around in fact in a lot of way they are far inferior to our prior batch as they all come off as being rather under designed and uninteresting. also the one that took the cake was the sloth-like mutant (you know sloth from the goonies) who helps them out in the 3rd act. i was waiting for him to ask for a baby ruth or start going on about rocky road ice cream. truly disappointing and shameful is the only way to describe most of the goings on here.  the gore is in the film but not nearly as visceral as the original in fact it seemed toned down for the most part as other than the mutant baby birth scene there really isn't anything that stood out like in the first. another major strike against this movie. so what did work here, the answer is nothing at all. this felt like a sequel designed specifically to make money off the success of the first and not to make an actually ""good"" film.  i can go on about the crappy drill sgt., the radio man that has a speech impediment (that's right, he is the kind of guy i want radioing in for help in a real crisis) or the pacifist fighter that resembles the exact same character mold as our ""hero"" in the first film but i believe you get the point. this movie is not even in the same league or even the same planet as the first. it should have been given another title and been added to the saturday night line up on the sci-fi channel. a true shame as a solid sequel could have been made but alas it looks like another horror movie that drops the ball on nearly every level and will get one of my lowest scores as i give thhe 2 the same score as its part: 2/10 dreadful: words cannot describe how bad this movie is a total polar opposite of its predecessor in every way, uninspired and down-right unnecessary. next time guys if your going to make a sequel this bad...don't even bother. please don't go support this garbage at the theaters, save your money and thank me later!!!!",0
"there are two groups of people...those who love every fellini movie they see and normal people. while i will admit that i have really enjoyed some of his films, i can also honestly say that i can't stand some of them. my opinion, by the way, is not just some knee-jerk reaction--i have seen most of fellini's films and have also seen many films by the world's most famous directors. with this in mind, i feel that the most overrated and annoying directors can be both godard and fellini. they both have delighted in the bizarre and often unwatchable and yet have received gobs of accolades from reviewers and the ""intelligensia"", while the average person would never sit through some of their films. heck, even a person who loves international cinema would generally be left out in the cold when seeing some of these films. so, since only a small clique actually watches their films and they are already predisposed to seeing the directors as geniuses, it's not surprising that their films are so often praised--it's like a cult! if you don't believe me, think about many of godard's films such as first name carmen or alphaville,...or what about fellini satyricon or juliet of the spirits? these films abound with boredom, weirdness and incomprehensibility. now i am not saying a film can't be weird (after all i love happiness of the katakuris and shaolin soccer), but it must be watchable!  now on to this movie. somehow, fellini has managed to make a story about a sexually compulsive man completely boring and unsexy. this is no small task--it took a lot of work to make this so unwatchable. instead of cheap sexual thrills, the sex acts are choreographed in a silly and annoying way while the character of casanova is buried under so much makeup and prosthetics that donald sutherland looks like a ghoul. i know some of this must have been fellini's intention, but many viewers will be left completely bored by this sterile performance--especially since sutherland's lines are all poorly dubbed into italian and so he neither looks nor sounds like himself! unfortunately, when the movie is not wrapped up in these boring sexual escapades, there really isn't anything else to watch.  an interesting note about the first sexual conquest shown in this dull movie is that the actress looks amazingly like a younger version of fellini's wife, giulietta masina. considering that in addition to this, that in previous decades fellini had masina play characters such as a prostitute and a horribly abused woman, it seems like he may have truly hated his wife and was having this acted out on screen. i read a bit about them and their tempestuous relationship and it seems to bear this out as well. this is about the only aspect of this turgid film that i found at all interesting. don't say i didn't warn you!",0
"the complaints are valid, to me the biggest problem is that this soap opera is too aimed for women. i am okay with these night time soaps, like grey's anatomy, or ugly betty, or west wing, because there are stories that are interesting even with the given that they will never end. however, when the idea parallels the daytime soaps aimed at just putting hunky men (taye diggs, tim daly, and chris lowell) into sexual tension and romps, and numerous ridiculous difficult situations in a so-called little hospital, it seems like general hospital...or a female counterpart to baywatch. that was what men wanted and they had it, so if this is what women want so be it, but the idea that this is a high brow show (or something men will watch) is unrealistic.",0
"i did not like the pretentious and overrated apocalypse now. probably my favorite vietnam war film is the deer hunter. the deer hunter focused on one part of the war, and then focused on the lives before the war. this movie is essentially deer hunter 2. the script is too loose compared to the deer hunter. the story is never developed to the point that the audience can truly understand and feel for the characters like the deerhunter did. the vietnam flashbacks are not as gripping or involved as the ones in the deerhunter. this is why i can only give this movie 7 out of 10.  however, i think that the acting was outstanding. deniro and harris are truly amazing actors. they totally immersed themselves in their characters and expressed the great anguish of two former friends who lost their best friend bobby in combat. harris' character is a half-dead alcoholic, who hides the guilt that he has in bobby losing his life trying to save his.  i also like the supporting cast. everyone in the town is part of the movie. the town obviously can't handle vietnam vets very well. like many small towns, it is all about being quiet, humble, and minding one's business. harris' character, however, can't be any of these things. it is interesting how wars effect people. some people rebound quickly, while others never really recover.",1
"in an era of such awful cartoons, i am rather in shock to see a movie with such good morals make it to the imdb bottom list for animated movies.  this movie does contradict the first. i won't deny that. however, when i was in the target age group for this movie, i didn't even notice, nor would it have mattered if i did. the people who made it may have used ""new generation"" to note that this is another way the care bear family could have began. perhaps we are meant to decide for ourselves how the care bear family truly began.  this was my favorite movie at age 3-6, and it did not scare me or confuse me at all.

"not to be confused with lewis teague's ""alligator"" (1980) which actually is an excellent film, this ""il fiume del grande caimano"" laboriously ends the exotic trilogy sergio martino made around the end of the seventies (including the rather watchable ""l'isola degli uomini pesce"" and the not so good ""la montagna del dio cannibale""). tracing outrageously the plot of ""jaws"", the script fails at creating any suspense what so ever. the creature is ludicrous and its victims are simply despicable. stelvio cipriani's lame tune poorly illustrates the adventures of these silly tourists presented from the very beginning as the obvious items of the reptile's meal. no thrill out of this, rather laughters actually! and we could find this pitiful flick quite funny if the dialogs and the appearance of the natives were not so obviously inspired by pure racism. very soon the giggling stops in favor of a sour feeling witnessing such a patronizing attitude. we could excuse badly made films and poor fxs, but not that kind of mentality. never!",0

"the vigilante has long held a fascination for audiences, inasmuch as it evokes a sense of swift, sure justice; good triumphs over evil and the bad guy gets his deserts. it is, in fact, one of the things that has made the character of dirty harry callahan (as played by clint eastwood) so popular. he carries a badge and works within the law, but at heart, harry is a vigilante, meting out justice `his' way, which often puts him in conflict with his own superiors, as well as the criminals he's pursuing. but it's what draws the audience; anyone who's ever been bogged down in bureaucratic nonsense of one kind or another, delights in seeing someone cut through the red tape and get on with it-- even if it's only on the screen. and that satisfaction derived from seeing justice done-- and quickly-- is one of the elements that makes `sudden impact,' directed by and starring eastwood, so successful. in this one, the fourth of the series, while working a homicide, harry encounters a bona fide vigilante at work-- an individual whose brand of justice parallels his own, with one exception: whoever it is, he's definitely not carrying a badge.  in his own inimitable way, inspector callahan has once again ended up on the bad side of the department and is ordered to take some vacation time. so he does; as only `dirty harry' can. in a small town north of san francisco, harry finds himself smack dab in the middle of a homicide case, which he quickly links to a recent murder in san francisco because of the unique m.o. employed by the perpetrator. unaccountably, harry encounters resistance from the local police chief, jannings (pat hingle), who advises him to take his big city tactics and methods elsewhere. not one to be deterred, however, harry continues his investigation, which ultimately involves a beautiful and talented young artist, jennifer spencer (sondra locke). gradually, harry discovers a link between the victims; the burning question, though, is where does jennifer spencer fit into the picture?  eastwood is in top form here, both in front of and behind the camera, and it is arguably the second best of the five-film series, right behind the original `dirty harry.' it had been seven years since the last `harry' offering (`the enforcer,' 1976), but eastwood steps right back into the character with facility and renewed vigor. and this one definitely benefits from having him in the director's chair, as he is able to recapture the essence of, not only his own character, but that `spirit' that made these films so successful, and he does it by knowing the territory and establishing a continuity that all but erases that seven year gap between #s 3 and 4. as with all the films he directs, eastwood sets a deliberate pace that works perfectly for this material and creates just enough tension to keep it interesting and involving from beginning to end.   the screenplay, by joseph stinson, is well written and formulated to that distinctive `dirty harry' style; the dialogue is snappy and the story itself (conceived by charles b. pierce and earl e. smith) is the most engaging since the original `dirty harry,' as it successfully endeavors to play upon the very personal aspects of the drama, rather than entirely upon the action. the characters are well drawn and convincing, and, of course, this is the film that gave us one of harry's best catch-phrases: `go, ahead-- make my day...'  as harry, clint eastwood perfectly embodies all of the elements that make this character so popular: he lives by a personal moral code, a true individual made of the kind of stuff we envision as that of the pioneers who settled this country and made america what it is today. harry personifies that sense of freedom and justice we all strive for and hold so dear, possibly more so today than ever before. no matter who we are or where we come from, there's undeniably a part of us that wants to be harry, or at least have him around. `dirty harry' is an icon of the cinema, and it's impossible to envision anyone but eastwood portraying him; for better or worse, eastwood `is' dirty harry, without question, just as sean connery is james bond and basil rathbone, sherlock holmes.  sondra locke is entirely effective here in the role of jennifer spencer, a young woman wronged and out for vengeance, or as she sees it, `justice.' she manages to bring a hard-edged determination laced with vulnerability to her character, with a convincing, introspective approach that is far beyond what is typical of the `action' genre. even amid the violence, locke keeps her focus on jennifer and the traumatic events that have brought her to this stage of her life. her portrayal makes a perfect complement to eastwood's harry, and becomes, in philosophy and deed, something of his counterpart.  in supporting roles, two performances stand out: paul drake, as mick, creates the best `psycho' since andy robinson's dynamic portrayal of the serial killer in the original `dirty harry.' with actually very limited screen time, drake establishes a genuinely disconcerting presence that is believable and convincing, which adds much to the purely visceral response of the audience. this is the guy you can't wait to see harry take care of in the end. also effective is audrie j. neenan, who makes her character, ray parkins, the epitome of the proverbial `low life,' who can be found in any bar in any city. it's a performance that evokes a gut-level response, and it adds greatly to the credibility of the film, in that it helps provide that necessary sense of realism.  the supporting cast includes albert popwell (horace), mark kevloun (bennett) and nancy parsons (mrs. kruger). with a perfect blend of drama and action, `sudden impact' dispenses justice that is a fulfilling respite from reality; the perfect justice of a not-so-perfect world, that makes for a satisfying cinematic experience. 9/10.",1

"i have the entire weissmuller tarzan series on dvd (fully restored editions) & i never tire of watching them. my personal favorite is ""tarzan and his mate"", due entirely (well almost entirely) to maureen o'sullivan's costume and the occasional flashes of her genital area beneath that leather flap hanging in front. before anyone claims that a - it wasn't really her, or b - it wasn't really what it looks like, let me say that i have watched it numerous time, in high zoom mode, and trust me...it is her, and she is completely naked underneath that costume...several times, especially during the lion attack at the end, careful viewing in slow motion and maximum zoom will reveal that she was shaved except for a tiny patch of dark hair covering her labia...there is no mistake about that at all. as to the swimming scene being a body double in a ""skin"" suit, yes, it is a double, but she is not wearing any ""skin"" suit or anything else...again, slow motion and maximum zoom shows everything to those who want to see it. now, that controversy out of the way, let's move on the actual movie...i thought the script was really well thought out and written tightly...the action sequences were simply great, although it is obviously a stuntman riding the rhino, weissmuller actually wrestles the big male lion...the use of background shots that were second unit stuff from africa is very well blended with the studio & us locations making it sometimes hard to tell which is which. don't complain too much though, remember that 90% of all films is phony anyway, so just relax and enjoy the damned thing with a big bowl of popcorn, some cold beer, and a fresh pack of smokes...a sexy and willing girlfriend/wife isn't out of line either...lol. oh...one final word about nudity...at the very beginning, while the white hunters are speaking dialogue, keep your eyes on the background extras...there are several good shots of nude african girls (obviously shot on location) behind them. one more thing, the movie is not racist by the standards of the 1930's until the 1960's...that's the way colored people were thought of and portrayed back then. shaft hadn't even been thought about at that time, nor would audiences have accepted any other portrayals of them at the time in history. safaris actually did use natives carrying luggage on their heads...and tiny's character did die a heroic death trying to save the white hunters and jane. as a matter of fact, it wasn't until gene autry treated the native americans and colored people in his westerns like real human beings that hollywood began to see that it was okay to do so.",1

"""bedknobs and broomsticks"" is a magical adventure film with a certain charm, despite not being one of the best disney works. it has a generally good story, nice songs, great characters, good actors, magical and delightful special effects, good settings and lovely landscapes of england.  it also combines very well live-action and animation. the animation itself is, of course, pretty good. the animation resembles very much that of the 1973 animated film ""robin hood"" and the same can be said about the animated characters: there are plenty of wild animals such as bears, elephants, hippos, lions, crocodiles and others like in ""robin hood"". besides, the king (a lion) seems to be a mix of prince john and king richard, not to mention that the bear does look like little john.  this movie is often compared to ""mary poppins"" with a reason. both combine live-action and animation with a similar artwork. both have similar settings in london. both have their own magic and a magical woman. the kids (carrie, charlie and cute little paul) are a bit like the banks children. both movies were directed by robert stevenson and both cast david tomlinson. however, instead of a very serious man like george banks, david tomlinson plays a merrier and magical man - professor emelius browne. with its magic, this movie has also some slight but significant similarities to harry potter's stories.  the majority of the songs are good. ""the age of not believing"" and ""the beautiful briny sea"" are the very best. ""portobello road"" is nice too.  david tomlinson is great in this film once again. angela lansbury is great as miss price and the 3 kid actors are all fine too: cindy o'callaghan as carrie, ian weighill as charlie (a boy in «the age of not believing») and roy snart as the youngest brother paul.  i like the black cat. it's pretty cool. it looks a bit like salem, the black cat from the tv series ""sabrina, the teenage witch"". i find cute whenever one of the movie's characters is transformed into a white rabbit. rabbits are really cute, fluffy and adorable animals. i just love them! even funnier is whenever professor emelius browne is transformed into a white rabbit because, when he's transformed in human again, he shakes his nose like a rabbit. it's really hilarious, combined with his comical figure and that mustache.  overall, this is an okay movie, but its ending is quite bad. the first minutes of the movie are nothing special, but then it improves a lot. the ending, however, is weak. that's my major criticism about it, in great part because the animated knights thing is a little too much for me and also due to the war feeling.",1
"i wondered why i didn't like peggy sue got married more than i did, when it first came out in 1986, with all the hype. somehow i found nic cage's character off-putting. way off-putting. then the plot didn't seem to make sense. then by the end of the credits, the question came to mind: what point was this movie making? what was it saying? the answer, unfortunately, was not much, if anything. i really don't think this movie aimed at making a statement; unless it was ""your life is your life, you're gonna make the same mistakes no matter what, so keep your eye upon the doughnut, and not the hole"". not a very profound statement, and i'm sorry, not profoundly made in this movie. the writing simply isn't that good. the direction is uneven, and is strangely overblown at times. kathleen turner was the best, and in my opinion, only worthwhile thing in this movie, and performed something of a miracle creating a whole character despite bizarre, unexplained circumstances, with a script that had no apparent statement to make.   she also finally cleared up the mystery for me of the main reason i didn't enjoy this movie more. she states in her autobiography that cage made a point of fighting his uncle coppola's direction every step of the way, doing it ""his own way"" (not a good idea for a new actor), and putting on a goofy voice she called ""stupid"". his voice was annoying, abrasive and unnatural, and his character was obnoxious and overbearing as a young guy. i understand what he was attempting to do: play a young-guy ""hot shot"" who is not as hot as he thinks he is, setting up his own karma for future failure. but he goes overboard, the way he does it is abrasive, not effective, and if he had listened to his uncle instead of ""fighting the man"", we would have had a more enjoyable film. cage slips a little with his obnoxious voice stylings in the movie and occasionally sounds like a real person, and those scenes are more watchable than others. but if i had to watch the movie through in its entirety, i would find myself wanting to pay someone in l.a. to pour a bucket of water over his head during some of his more affected (put-on) scenes.   the movie doesn't aim for a statement, doesn't make a point, is great to look at except when cage is doing a demented elvis impression (but without the voice), and is, ultimately, confusing and a waste of time. given all this, kathleen turner surely deserved an oscar in this flailing mess of a movie. i can't recommend anyone spending two hours watching this, unless you like turner and have a remote to pick out all her scenes. believe me, you will miss nothing plotwise by skipping the other scenes, and it will make just as much sense.   kathleen turner is getting a lot of flak from critics regarding her cage comments, which proves that she's strong enough to be honest, and to hell with other people's comments. you go, turner! i'm not particularly a fan of this actress any more than i am of any other first-rate actor or actress, but her candor is refreshing. cage's acting can be good to annoying, and here it doesn't work. at least, in this film, now we know why.",0
"where to begin? how best to describe just how awful this movie is???  let's start with the campy hick humor. it isn't very funny. add a bunch of musicians impersonating actors - meat loaf is horrible and deborah harry is even worse. pity poor art carney, who should have known better than to do this movie.  and then there is the plot. a roadie whose life goal is to work an alice cooper show meets a girl whose life goal is to be a groupie for alice cooper. at least they get what they want...  and then, just when the movie should end, they can't come up with a more plausible last scene than a - well, i won't ruin it for you if you really want to see the movie.  there are certain actors that let you know that this is going to be a ""b"" movie or perhaps worse. gailard sartain is one of them for me - and he has a more prominent role. that's a sure sign that the movie probably won't be very good. if nothing else, the movie lives up to the low expectations - even exceeds them by being worse than poor.  let's just say this. this is the movie against which all bad movies are compared. and none are worse than roadie.",0
"it's a testament to gosha's incredible film-making prowess that he was able to complete both hitokiri and his stunning masterpiece, goyokin, in the same year, 1969. and it's a testament to how criminally underrated he remains for the general public (compared to media darlings like the great akira kurosawa), that both hitokiri and goyokin have received less than 500 votes between the two of them.  shintaro katsu is okada izo: mad dog killer, loyal to the tosha clan and their boss takechi, played by another genre stalwart, tatsuya nakadai. the tosha clan was part of a larger alliance that supported the emperor against the flailing shogunate. the historical backdrop is fairly accurate - with japan's increasing political turmoil between imperialists and the tokugawa and the pressure by the west to end a 300 year social and political seclusion. it helps a lot to know a thing or two about japanese history and what eventually led to the meiji restoration and the abolition of the tokugawa shogunate, but it's not essential by any means. the movie was made primarily for a japanese audience so certain things are taken for granted but it flows very well for the uninitiated as well.  as one would expect from a hideo gosha film in his golden years (the late 60's) the visual palette is breathtaking, the use of external and internal symbolism hiding behind pictorial beauty. style however is never decorative for gosha - it is always employed in the service of story.   and speaking of story, hitokiri is dominated both literally and figuratively by the tortured main character izo okada. as most chambara protagonists, izo finds himself in a moral double-bind, torn between giri (obligation) and ninjo (natural impulse) - although it takes a while for him to realize what exactly his giri is. in the first half of the movie izo is trying for social self-advancement. lofty aspirations of social rank and marriage with an aristocrat's daughter - a great progression for someone coming from a farmer's background in the rigid social caste system of 19th century japan.   the turning point for izo is when he realizes at what cost self-advancement comes, the loss of identity and by consequence the loss of self. it is at that point that he undergoes a very symbolic transformation from a famous swordsman of the tosha clan to a ""nameless"" drifter without past or future, torazo the vagrant. although not technically nameless and not a genre drifter in yojimbo's mold, it is the loss of his former self and the cast off of ego, ambition and self-dillusion that allows izo to see things as they really are and redeem himself.   hitokiri ends (which i won't reveal here) in the best way any story can end: both positive and negative with a deeply ironic twist that gives izo the last laugh, a last sardonic remark in the face of death.",1

"""the rainmaker"" released in 1956 - has some of the finest actors of its time. katharine hepburn, lloyd bridges, and burt lancaster being the principle players. not even they can save this completely over acted melodrama. first of all, hepburn is horribly miscast as a shy spinster - despite her brilliance as an actress, not even she can pull this off. she is too strong to be credible as being this much of a simpleton, and was just too old for the part. lancaster over acts to the extreme, and earl holliman is way too hammy and comes off more like jethro clampett. only bridges and the ever reliable wendell corey seem to rise above the cast a bit - but even they can only do so much. it seems like the 1950's was a time when katharine hepburn wanted to spread her wings a bit as an actress, and that is fine. she just made a bad choice here. fortunately for her fans (me being among them) she didn't make too many of them. despite an a-list cast and good production values, it doesn't work.",0

"this is one of joan crawford's best talkies. it was the first gable-crawford pairing, and made it evident to mgm and to audiences that they were a sizzling team, leading the studio to make seven more films with them as co-stars.  the film convincingly depicts the downward slide of a brother and sister who, after their father loses everything in the stock market crash, must fend for themselves and work for a living. life is hard in the depression, and soon even their attempts at finding legitimate work prove futile, and they resort to underworld activity.   joan crawford is excellent as the socialite-turned-moll. she's smart, complex, and believable. she even tempers the theatrical stiffness of the other actors' early talkie acting style. clark gable is a diamond-in-the rough, masculine and gruff as the no-nonsense gangster who becomes involved with crawford's character. the same year he would play a similar and even more successful role opposite norma shearer in ""a free soul"", securing his position as top male sex symbol at mgm.  if you like crawford in this type of role, don't miss ""paid"", which she did a year earlier, which is also among her best early talkie performances.

"although this lovely work of art does use some of the cinematic vocabulary of surrealism, it is in fact nothing of the sort. it is a political and cultural allegory of mexico's post-columbian odyssey, as even a passing glance at mexico's history will attest.   in contrast to ""like water for chocolate,"" ""erendira"" expects the viewer to meet it at least half way so that understanding it takes a little work. (a good starting point is to see the grandmother character as spain: proud, aloof, sorrowful and, above all else, weighed-down-with-history.)  the ultimate actions of the heroine are obscure because the ""outcome"" of history (i.e. the present) is always obscure, since we are too close to it for honest evaluation. refusal to neatly tie up loose ends is the only real choice available to the director, given the ambitions of the film.

""journey to the center of the earth"" is an abomination. the movie seems to be a comedy despite its superficial satire about dictatorships. albert pyun is one of my favorite low budget action directors, but he blew it on this lightweight shambles of a science fiction saga.",0
"the author of the book, by the same title, should not have let her name be used for this movie. if you have read the book, this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details. the movie adds nothing, in terms of artistic merit, to the book's own literary achievement.  for those who have not read the book: you will also be disappointed. not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace, it doesn't offer anything more while it is moving slowly (like character development, for example). some viewers might be entertained by some of the graphic lesbian love scenes later on in the movie, but you might as well watch a showtime special for the stuff they show in therese and isabelle--its fairly tame and not imaginative at all.",0
"i loved the batman tv series and was really looking forward to this. but they tried to do too much.  why they had the story of adam west and burt ward trying to recover the batmobile was beyond me. i don't want to knock burt or adam for the way they look now.....it's been 35 years since they appeared at batman and robin, but to see them dressed in dress suits and fighting 'badguys' was kinda sad. i would rather of just seen the ex-stars do commentary. the batmobile side story was stupid.  as for the flashback movie, i think it was too short and left out way too much. it was really just a quick overview in my opinion. i'd like more background. they showed the penguin and joker for about a minute each just to tell the same stuff i already knew. the joker had a mustache under his makeup and the penguin had to smoke even though he hated it and was an ex-smoker. that was it on those 2.  i'd love to read the book. i am sure it has more in it that this showed. like why was there 2 riddlers or why 3 catwoman's or 3 mister freezes. where was commishioner gordon, cheif ohara, alfred, mister freeze, king tut, etc. the list goes on. like i said even the ones that were in this one were barely in it.  very disappointing. and really corny.",0
"i thought this movie was really really great because, in india cinemas nowadays, all you see is skin, music, and bad acting...in this movie, you can see some tradition, ethnicity, and at least some decency...although some parts were a little dramatic, guess what? that is what indian cinema is all about! after watching this movie, at least you don't get a headache from all the loud overrated music, or any violence, its just the truth, it teaches about love, and of course caring for the person you love throughout life...i think it was an amazing movie...kids can watch it without a doubt, and adults will enjoy the simplicity that used to be india's sure profoundness...until all these rap hits, miniskirts, and skin showing became a part of it.",1
"saw this movie recently and had higher hopes. not so much based upon the director, who hadn't made a cinematographic release before, but more based upon its cast. harvey keitel, scott glenn and craig wasson (lead role in body double, a brian de palma masterpiece) have all starred in great movies. not together though, and this fact hasn't exactly changed because of this one.  the film is unbelievable, very predictable and cliché. the only thing that might make it slightly appealing is the selection of locations on which it's been shot. in my humble opinion: don't waste your time on this one.",0
"well, i said it all in the summary, i simpley adore the movie and the cast...i would give each actor an oscar...great, great movie...i'm 25 now and i watched it 4 times in different periods and i always think i won't cry and i always do, about 2 or 3 times...;) meryl s. was absolutely brilliant, jeremy irons also..just brilliant...i wish the movie received more awards... i really don't know anybody who watched it and didn't loved it... also, glenn close was fantastic... the story was beautiful and sad at the same time... i loved the fact that despite everything clara and esteban loved each other so much, and how blanca was close to her parents...",1
"this very good movie crackles with tension. the stakes are, of course, high--will the police and widmark, the public health doctor, apprehend the criminals who don't know that they are carrying plague before a full-scale epidemic breaks out? but smaller plot elements introduce tension in every scene--between widmark and the police captain, between the bad guys played by palance and mostel, between palance and a dying plague-stricken man whom palance mistakenly believes is the subject of a manhunt because he has smuggled in some valuable commodity, between widmark and his wife, and with the underlying question of whether the public is better served by informing them of the danger or hiding the situation to avoid a full-scale panic. the movie is beautifully shot by kazan, in extraordinarily well-choreographed long takes shot on location in new orleans, and ends in a stunning climax, where palance flees like a rat from his pursuers, through the docks and warehouses of the city. the commentary is superb, probably the best that i've heard, covering the cinematography, the framing and lighting of shots, the production design, the casting of non-professional actors in small roles, and the ironies and parallelisms in the plot, like an insightful seminar on 1950s film techniques and film noir generally. watch it once to enjoy the film on its own, and, if you are interested in film-making, a second time with the commentary on to learn.",1
"i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexander leesville, louisiana i loved this movie. in fact i loved being an actress in this movie. iwas featured as a pregnant teenager in the second half of the movie. you may remember me more clearly in the classroom scene when the werewolf was exposing himself on film. i was the female in the front row with my hands planted on my face in reaction to what we were watching on the movie projector. in fact they double took me a few times so it's hard to miss that mistake. thumbs up to full moon high. wish it come to cable soon. cheryl lockett alexander  leesville, louisiana",1
"the beauty of this film is evidenced in the great portrayal of the power of a mother's love, the exceptional performances, the steady execution and the quite innovative script. the film tells the story of an indian woman, nandini, who lives in canada with her husband shekhar and little kid raja. all of a sudden her husband informs her that his family in india (of whom she had not even known) is in troubles and the couple rush to india. when they get into the village, nanadini is shocked and terrified to witness a very wild rural culture; shekhar's family, ruled by his cruel, highly cynical and merciless father narasimha, lives a poor and highly violent lifestyle which is full of murder and terror and where women are subservient and helpless. nandini starts nagging shekhar to return home, but he is soon killed by his father's enemies. when she wants to leave, narasimha refuses to let her take raja back to india. here starts the intense struggle which can be called ""nandini vs. narasimha"".  india is not presented in a particularly positive light in this film, but it only shows a very tiny minority of its rural areas, so it may be even correct. the portrayal is in my view fair and not one-sided because the positive side is also presented to an extent. such a horrifying sight could be shown in a film about any country in the world. the locations are amazing, the music is wonderful, and krishna vamshi's direction is aided by very effective cinematography and good editing. one thing that must be noted is the very ear-pleasing background score by ismail darbar, it is beautiful. the characters are very well defined though we do get to see both their bright and dark sides in different portions of the film. portrayed realistically throughout, the film flows well and is an interesting and fairly entertaining watch. its dialogues are superb and intelligently written, and although the shocking proceedings can be very disturbing at some points, a great deal of positive moments manage to relieve the tension.  the film's biggest strength is the performances. karisma kapoor is breathtaking and very believable as nandini. her ability to strike a balance between vulnerability and unrestrained emotion is simply incredible. she displays so much intensity, impulsiveness, anguish and determination as the mother who wants to get her son back that this little kid seems to be her own son. her outbreaks while facing off nana patekar which are like volcanic eruptions show us how the simplest of women can become a tigress when it comes to her child. after fiza, this is her most powerful performance. one of the greatest actors indian cinema has seen, nana patekar is indescribable as narasimha. he manages to be hateful as narasimha yet admirable as the actor who plays him. patekar displays cruelty, wittiness and even humanity with total conviction. he is outstanding. another great performance comes unsurprisingly from india's most underrated actress, deepti naval, who sensitises her character to perfection. sanjay kapoor is just adequate and shahrukh khan provides great comic relief. anyway, do watch shakti - it could have been better, but it is definitely a must-watch.",1
"it's depressing to see where jackie chan has ended up. he used to be an unstoppable hurricane of punches, kicks and incredible stunts. to be fair, he's now in his fifties and one would expect some slowdown. but with 'rush hour 3', where he takes a back seat to chris tucker (of all people!), and then there's 'kung fu panda' where not only is he in a purely vocal role but his character barely has any dialogue... to say that jackie chan has seen better days is a colossal understatement.  it's times like this when the only solution is to whip out a dusty old vhs tape and watch jackie kick some arses in his younger, fitter, chris tucker-free days.  enter 'police story'. jackie chan plays kar-kui, a policeman whose task it is to protect a witness before a major trial. he faces resistance from both the unco-operative witness and the numerous hit men sent by the mob to silence them both.  but on the other hand, who cares? we don't watch jackie chan films for the story. we watch them to see jackie chan perform eye-popping stunts and generally punch and kick a whole lot of people who are less awesome than he is.  and on that level, 'police story' doesn't disappoint at all. there is an awesome showdown in a shopping mall at the end that culminates in jackie sliding down a giant, high-voltage chandelier. seriously, if this sort of thing happened more often, no male would ever need coaxing to go shopping for clothes.  there is also comedy, much of which involves kar-kui inadvertently upsetting may (maggie cheung), his eternally suffering and apparently ever forgiving girlfriend. the humour on the whole is pretty unsubtle, but it works so i'm not complaining.  the acting isn't too subtle, either. indeed, i'm not sure there was anything subtle about 'police story' at all. director jackie chan (yeah, he does that too) clearly has a deep understanding of why we watch his films, and knows that while we're waiting for the next fight to start, the last thing we want is to be looking for nuance and depth and inner meaning.  so 'police story' is a blast. as is the case with most of his films, the fact that jackie actually does the stuff you see on the screen puts it head and shoulders above the competition. i mean, when jackie chan really is hanging from a speeding bus by an umbrella, a whole new ""wow!"" factor is added to the action.",1
"one of the best true-crime movies ever made and very faithful to truman capote's book which invented the true-crime novel genre. haunting quincy jones musical score and terrific acting by scott wilson and robert blake as dick and perry, the killers. why wilson didn't go on to be a big star after this movie is a mystery to me.  the black and white cinematography and editing in this movie are top notch. the re-creation of the murders is frightening and since it leaves the actual murders to your imagination, even more scary than if they had shown the shotgun going off. the movie was filmed in the actual clutter house which had been sold to another person after the murders. the movie has a very documentary feel---besides the scenes at the actual clutter home other scenes were filmed at the gas stations and stores the killers actually went to. nancy clutter's beloved horse, babe, is even in the movie. will geer has a great turn as the prosecutor in the short trial scene which is not only filmed in the actual courtroom but has several of the real clutter murder jurors portraying themselves as the jury for the movie.   this is a solid movie, scary every time you see it.",1
"hollywood, the home of hype, glamor and the search for profits, is scarcely ruled by spiritual values, and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly (better to go farther afield--to the films of bresson, dreyer, rossellini and bergman, for probing depictions of the spirituality). ""strange cargo"" is no exception. this odd hybrid of adventure film, love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate. that a figure of providence and salvation would work to match verne (clark gable at his most cockily mannered and self-regarding) and julie (joan crawford, snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough dames) seems ludicrous at best. is this the patron saint of the star system at work, matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the m-g-m lot? but. . .there are good supporting performances here, and visually arresting moments: the shadowy prison barracks; the escaping boat by moonlight, or against a painterly cloudscape; julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up; julie and monsieur pig (peter lorre) bargaining for verne's freedom as the storm builds; an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts. . .above all, there is paul lukas's dignified and detached performance as hessler, a murderer who can appreciate cambreau's virtues, yet turns his back on him. in the film's most arresting moment, hessler, having left cambreau, stands outside the cabin. we hear the wind through the jungle, see the shadows on his face, which conveys a moment of fear and self-doubt. then he exits into the night. in this moment, hessler achieves an ambiguity, depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve. is the film's secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with hessler?",0
"warning: possible spoilers (but not really - keep reading). ahhh, there are so many reasons to become utterly addicted to this spoof gem that i won't have room to list them all. the opening credits set the playful scene with kitsch late 1950s cartoon stills; an enchanting peres 'prez' prado mambo theme which appears to be curiously uncredited (but his grunts are unmistakable, and no-one else did them); and with familiar cast names, including kathy najimi a full year before she hit with sister acts 1 & 2 plus teri hatcher from tv's superman.  every scene is imbued with shallow injustices flung at various actors, actresses and producers in daytime tv. peeking behind the careers of these people is all just an excuse for an old-fashioned, delicious farce. robert harling penned this riotous spoof that plays like an issue of mad magazine, but feels like a gift to us in the audience. some of the cliched characters are a bit dim, but everyone is drizzling with high jealousy, especially against celeste talbert (sally field) who is the show's perennial award-winning lead, nicknamed ""america's sweetheart"". the daytime emmies-like awards opening does introduce us to celeste's show, the sun also sets. against all vain fears to the contrary, celeste wins again. she is overjoyed, because it's always ""such a genuine thrill"": ""adam, did you watch? i won! well, nguh..."" the reason for adam's absence soon becomes the justification for the entire plot, and we're instantly off on a trip with celeste's neuroses. she cries, screeches, and wrings her hands though the rest of the movie while her dresser tawnee (kathy najimi, constantly waddling after celeste, unseen through celeste's fog of paranoia) indulges a taste for tammy faye baker, for which tawnee had been in fact specifically hired.  rosie schwartz (whoopi goldberg) has seen it all before. she is the head writer of the show, and she and celeste have been excellent support networks to each other for 15 years. so when celeste freaks, rosie offers to write her off the show for six months: ""we'll just say that maggie went to visit with the dalai lama."" but celeste has doubts: ""i thought that the dalai lama moved to la."" ""-well, then, some other lama, fernando lamas, come on!"". such a skewering line must be rather affronting to still living beefcake actor lorenzo lamas, son of aforementioned fernando lamas (d. 1982).  those who can remember the economics teacher (ben stein) in ferris bueller's day off (1986) as he deadeningly calls the roll (""bueller. bueller. bueller""), will take secret pleasure from seeing him again as a nitwit writer. other well hidden member of the cast include garry marshall (in real life mr happy days and brother of penny), who ""gets paid $1.2 million to make the command decisions"" on the sun also sets - he says he definitely likes ""peppy and cheap""; and carrie fisher as betsy faye sharon, who's ""a bitch"".  geoffrey anderson (kevin kline) is the ""yummy-with-a-spoon"" (and he is, by the way) dinner theater actor now rescued from his hell by david seaton barnes (robert downey jr), and brought back to the same show he was canned from 20 years earlier. of course this presents some logical challenges for the current scriptwriters because his character, rod randall, was supposed to have been decapitated all those years ago. somehow they work out the logical difficulties, and geoffrey anderson steps off the choo-choo.  celeste can now only get worse, and her trick of going across the washington bridge no longer helps. first, her hands shake as she tries to put on mascara, but she soon degenerates into a stalker. unfortunately, she cannot get rid of geoffrey anderson so easily. geoffrey's been promised development of his one-man play about hamlet, and he means to hold the producer to that promise. ""i'm not going back to florida no-how!"", argues geoffrey. ""you try playing willie loman in front of a bunch of old farts eating meatloaf !"" and indeed, seeing geoffrey's dinner theater lifestyle amongst all the hocking and accidents is hilarious. back in florida in his willie loman fat suit in his room, geoffrey anderson used to chafe at being called to stage as ""mr loman"". he was forced to splat whatever cockroaches crawled across his tv with a shoe, and to use pliers instead of the broken analog channel changer. now he find himself as the yummy surgeon dating laurie craven, the show's new ingenue; so he's not leaving.  beautiful elizabeth shue (as laurie) rounds out the amazing ensemble cast who all do the fantastic job of those who know the stereotypes all too well. but, of course, the course to true love never did run smoothly. montana moorehead (cathy moriarty) is getting impatient waiting for her star to rise, and is getting desperate for some publicity.  will her plots finally succeed? will celeste settle her nerves, or will she kill tawnee first? will the producer get mr fuzzy? -you'll just have to watch * the second half * of this utterly lovable, farcically malicious riot.  and you'll really have to see to believe how the short-sighted geoffrey reads his lines without glasses live off the teleprompter. if you are not in stitches with stomach-heaving laughter and tears pouring down your face, feel free to demand your money back for the video rental. soapdish (1991) is an unmissable gem that you will need to see again and again, because it's not often that a movie can deliver so amply with so many hilarious lines. this is very well-crafted humor, almost all of it in the writing. a draw with blazing saddles (1974) for uproarious apoplexy value, although otherwise dissimilar. watch it and weep. a happy source for anyone's video addiction. 10 out of 10.",1

"yet another remake of ""fistful of dollars"", sergio leone's remake of kurosawa's ""yojimbo"" (suggested by the novel 'red harvest').  this one is strictly a b-movie; taken as that, it is rather enjoyable. the direction is crisp, the acting full of verve, the limitations of its 'direct-to-video' photography well-handled.  the weakness of the film is in the disastrous decision to marry the 'fistful'/'yojimbo' plot to a sub-plot from leone's 'once upon a time in the west'. although leone directed both 'fistful' and 'west', his motivations behind the two films couldn't be anymore different. the 'man with no name' (eastwood) is a borderline socio-path with a soft spot for broken families. harmonica (chaeles bronson) is obsessed with his own broken family, and obsessed with revenge. these two characters would not have had much to do with each other. in order to bring them together, 'gun crazy' has to twist it's plot and complicate it until we lose track of which story we're actually following.  but this is a b-movie after all, and filled with action and silliness; it's entertaining on that level, just don't expect anything more.",1
"have you heard the story about the reluctant heroes who were hired by a king to slay a dragon? oh, you have? was it set in a world entirely composed of small islands floating above clouds, and did the heroes have to make dangerous leaps from one island to the next on their journey? did water flow upwards and remnants of great cities levitate on the horizon? i didn't think so.  i stumbled onto this movie by accident and i'm really glad that i did! it's one of the most beautiful movies i've ever seen. much like the pixar movies, it's a piece of computer animated art that could only be possible in today's world. the animators have invested thought into almost everything that appears on the screen, and this attention to detail is staggering (the scene where the mushrooms in the foreground belch green smoke whilst the characters walk obliviously in the background is one of my favourites). the monsters are also fully realised and wonderful to watch in action.  although the plot may not be entirely unique, the movie has enough charm to make sure you keep watching. our protagonists are likable and interesting, ensuring the audience is behind their almost impossible quest to reach the end of the world and destroy the dragon which might otherwise devour everything in its path. of course, hector is the character most will fall in love with. a small blue creature with a crazy grin and a tendency to speak a mixture of nonsense and english, hector provides comedy relief in a way jar jar binks could only dream of.  in summary, i'd recommend watching the dragon hunters if you get the opportunity. watch it for the incredible animation, the breath-taking battle scenes and for a glimpse into a world that's unlike anything else you've seen on a cinema or television screen. at the very least, it's a fun way to spend an hour and a half - no matter if you're nine or twenty-nine (which, in fact, i am)!",1
"i've no idea what dimwit from san francisco came up with this stupid plot, but apparently they need to get off whatever drugs they are taking and put their analyst on danger money -- now.  yeah, this is a plausible story, if you regard the alien abduction sequence in ""life of brian"" as plausible.  this film is little more than a leftist pipedream. had the us and ussr give up nuclear weapons, the result would've been to eliminate the only real obstacle that kept the two from engaging in a war. bad as korea, vietnam and other wars of the era were, they were ""proxy wars"" fought to keep the superpowers from a direct engagement.  this film makes me think about how realistic it was when some group of high school kids would go on a hunger strike against nuclear proliferation. as if someone would say ""mr. president, some kids at drastic high are not eating!"" and ronald reagan would reply ""my god! i'd better revise my defense policy!"" right.  like this film? wouldn't it be better if the soviet union would've collapsed because they could not support their massive arms build... wait, that happened!",0
"i hate reading reviews that say something like, 'don't waste your time, this film stinks on ice.' it does to that reviewer yet for me, it may have some sort of naïve charm. if you like the other 'whistler' series films, this one will be watchable. if you like 40s noirish films, this one will be watchable.  this film is not as good, in my opinion, as any of the earlier series entries which starred richard dix as the protagonist. it's much slower, and the plot is trite. you've seen this same narrative device used in many other films, and usually better.  but the acting is good, and so is the lighting, and the dialog. it's just lacking in energy and you'll likely figure out exactly what's going on and how it's all going to come out in the end not more than a quarter of the way through.  the 'whistler' series is semi-noir, and there character, mood, lighting, camera movement and angles are more important than the story itself. but this film is not noir. it's too light weight and hollywood innocent for that. neither richard dix's character nor those of any of his ladies in the previous films had to come to a good end. you just never knew until the end.  but still, i'll recommend this one for at least a single viewing. i've watched it at least twice myself, and got a reasonable amount of enjoyment out of it both times.",1
"ok, so it may not be the award-winning ""movie of the year"" type-film (apart from the brilliant soundtrack that i think won a few awards), but it is a really great film about 'the kid' (prince / o( take your pick) and the happenings around him living in minneapolis, playing his music. the music is absolutely superb, in my opinion you have to own this soundtrack, it is truly a classic and sums up the eighties sounds and feel in a wonderful fashion. and the movie itself plays out a nice plot, it's worth seeing over and over again, espeically if you like prince / o (which i do) of course.",1

"my favorite movie genre is the western, it's really the only movie genre that is of american origin. and despite sergio leone, no one does them quite like americans.  right at the top of my list of ten favorites westerns is winchester 73. it was the first pairing and only black and white film of the partnership of director anthony mann and actor james stewart. it was also a landmark film in which stewart opted for a percentage of the profits instead of a straight salary from universal. many such deals followed for players, making them as rich as the moguls who employed them.  anthony mann up to this point had done mostly b pictures, noir type stuff with no real budgets. just before winchester 73 mann had done a fine western with robert taylor, devil's doorway, that never gets enough praise. i'm sure james stewart must have seen it and decided mann was the person he decided to partner with.  in this film mann also developed a mini stock company the way john ford was legendary for. besides stewart others in the cast like millard mitchell, steve brodie, dan duryea, john mcintire, jay c. flippen and rock hudson would appear in future mann films.  it's a simple plot, james stewart is obsessed with finding a man named dutch henry brown and killing him. why i won't say, but up to this point we had never seen such cold fury out of james stewart on screen. anthony mann reached into jimmy stewart's soul and dragged out some demons all of us are afraid we have.  the hate is aptly demonstrated in a great moment towards the beginning of the film. after stewart and sidekick millard mitchell are disarmed by wyatt earp played by will geer because guns aren't carried in earp's dodge city. there's a shooting contest for a winchester rifle in dodge city and the betting favorite is dutch henry brown, played with menace by stephen mcnally. stewart, mitchell and geer go into the saloon and stewart and mcnally spot each other at the same instant and reach to draw for weapons that aren't there. look at the closeups of stewart and mcnally, they say more than 10 pages of dialog.  another character stewart runs into in the film is waco johnny dean played by dan duryea who almost steals the film. this may have been duryea's finest moment on screen. he's a psychopathic outlaw killer who's deadly as a left handed draw even though he sports two six guns.   another person stewart meets is shelley winters who's fiancé is goaded into a showdown by duryea and killed. her best scenes are with duryea who's taken a fancy to her. she plays for time until she can safely get away from him. guess who she ultimately winds up with?  there are some wonderful performances in some small roles, there ain't a sour note in the cast. john mcintire as a shifty indian trader, jay c. flippen as the grizzled army sergeant and rock hudson got his first real notice as a young indian chief. even john alexander, best known as 'theodore roosevelt' in arsenic and old lace has a brief, but impressive role as the owner of a trading post where both mcnally and stewart stop at different times.  mann and stewart did eight films together, five of them westerns, and were ready to do a sixth western, night passage when they quarreled and mann walked off the set. the end of a beautiful partnership that produced some quality films.",1
"william powell's final outing as philo vance occurs in the kennel murder case where the murder of a championship show dog leads to two more murders and one attempt of the human kind. it's all in the figuring out of how that leads to the who and why.  the philo vance murders by s.s. van dine were most popular at the time and the clever mr. van dine figured out a way to sell his books one at a time to the highest studio bidder. this is why you see so many philo vances and so many studios putting them out. had bill powell not gone on to greater fame with mgm as nick charles of the thin man series, he would have been known as the greatest of philo vances.   it turns out that powell had entered his little terrier captain in the same contest where the murdered dog was entered and then another rival owner became the first murder victim. as usual powell shows up eugene palette as sergeant heath whose biggest contribution to the proceedings was using his bulk to break down the locked from the inside door where the first murder victim was found.  i did say locked from the inside and it was an upper story so it was in figuring out the how. powell has a lovely group of suspects, as extensive as what normally is in a thin man mystery. people like paul cavanaugh, helen vinson, ralph morgan, mary astor, fill their cast roles well.  warner brothers liked this version so much that in fact they remade it again in the thirties with james stephenson in his one and only outing as philo vance. it doesn't hold a candle to this one.  as this is the only powell philo vance that is out on vhs or dvd by all means see this one or acquire it if you can.",1

"first off, i'd like to make a correction on another review of this film which said that the last musical to win the best picture academy award was 'gigi' in 1958. that is misinformation as 'west side story' won in 1962, 'my fair lady' won in 1965 and 'sound of music' won the year after that. that said, this film is absolutely fantastic! the story from the novel has been somewhat altered, but that's more because of the limitations that they had on a stage that they just didn't change back for a filmed version. however, i don't mind. in fact, i rather think the whole production flows better than the novel does. i like nancy bringing oliver to the bridge with her and being killed there instead of later in the apartment. the subtle things in this film are the ones that make me laugh. i love the moment mr. bumble and mrs. bumble start coming out at the beginning from the governors office. the underscore for that moment is brilliant. my three favorite actors for this film were jack wild, who plays the best dodger in any film version of the story, ron moody, a playful and humorous fagin (this character is worked out much better than he is in the book), and shani wallis, who is the strongest, most distressed version of nancy. the only reason i'm giving this film a 9 instead of a 10 is because of the two big production numbers which are 'concider yourself' and 'who will buy.' i always hate when the choreography in musicals in meant to look like people doing everyday chores and jobs. it looks awful and cheesy, especially when they're dancing at the london meat co. they should've just done regular choreography for these scenes. however, this film is a rare treasure that will stay with us, hopefully, forever.",1

"while some performances were good-victoria rowell, adrienne barbeau, and the two italian girlfriends come to mind-the story was lame and derivative, the emphasis on the girlfriend's racial background was handled clumsily at best, and the relatives were mostly portrayed as stereotypes, not as real people. i found myself wincing uncomfortably at many moments that were supposed to be funny. i can hardly comprehend why the local paper here in sf said this was a good movie, and wonder who posted the glowing review here on imdb. very disappointed in this movie, and mad i actually went to a theatre to see it, based on the faulty connection to garden state, which is a far funnier, more inventive, and touching movie than this one. i must especially mention the emotional climax in the church, which was so wooden and by-the-numbers that i nearly left, and some in the audience actually did. that was followed by a silly climax at the graveyard, which i saw coming 10 minutes before it happened. i really don't like being misled to spend my money so uselessly.",0
"* some spoilers *  this movie is sometimes subtitled ""life everlasting."" that's often taken as reference to the final scene, but more accurately describes how dead and buried this once-estimable series is after this sloppy and illogical send-off.  there's a ""hey kids, let's put on a show air"" about this telemovie, which can be endearing in spots. some fans will feel like insiders as they enjoy picking out all the various cameo appearances. co-writer, co-producer tom fontana and his pals pack the goings-on with friends and favorites from other shows, as well as real baltimore personages.  that's on top of the returns of virtually all the members of the television's show varied casts, your old favorites as well as later non-favorites.  there was always a tug-of-war pitting quality-conscious executive producer barry levinson, fontana, james yoshimura and the rest of the creative team against budget-conscious nbc execs, who simply wanted a another moronic police procedural like ""nash bridges,"" which regularly beat ""homicide"" in the ratings. the pressure told as the show bounced between riveting realism that transcended its form, and sleazy sensationalism that demeaned it.  unfortunately for this movie, fontana, co-writers yoshimura and eric overmeyer and director jean de segonzac simply threw in the towel. they took the most ludicrous story are from the series, topped it with an unlikely and artistically unfruitful new plot line, and laid the burden of carrying the whole mess on one of the weaker cast members.  briefly, some time has passed since the last episode of the show. the former heart of baltimore's homicide unit, yaphet kotto as lt. al giardello, is now a kurt schmoke-like candidate for mayor, and schmoke himself makes a cameo appearance. but this promising start immediately and improbably takes a tragic turn.  the spotlight shifts to giancarlo esposito as giardello's son mike. a handsome man who has done good work elsewhere, esposito was one of the pretty faces brought in late to supposedly enliven the tv series. but the question for viewers always was: is mike that uncomfortable as gee's son, or is esposito that uncomfortable in the role?  to be fair, esposito doesn't get a chance to play out the main story without interruption. that's because the writers choose this moment to revive another storyline that spat on the intelligence of the show's loyal voters.  an apparent snuff streaming video was promoted, and then seemed to actually take place, on the internet. after some red herrings, the detectives arrested a repellent suspect. but zaljko ivanek's harassed and overworked deputy states attorney forgot to file motions in time, and the suspect was released, only to be murdered later.  let's summarize: he forgot to file the paperwork because it wasn't the most sensational case of his career, because the mayor, the attorney general, the governor, the entire maryland legislature, the u.s. attorney general, nbc, court tv, the bbc, ap, reuters, people, the sun, the washington post, the new york times, the la times, time magazine, the times of london, the economist, the johannesburg mail and guardian, l'osservatore romano, le figaro, paris match, l'equipe and computer world weren't calling every 10 minutes to ask about the status of the case.  nevertheless, the old gang of detectives and associates flocks back to baltimore to help out. there's quite an array of talent on display. unfortunately, with the limited amount of dialogue to hand out, some of them are merely on display.  two of the strongest actors, clark johnson and melissa leo, are criminally underused, while time wasted on jon seda and michael michelle could be better spent on commercials. the writers do seem to satirize this, presenting jason priestley as the latest big-deal detective. on the other hand, they give easy-come, easy-go michelle forbes a very affecting scene.  there's some other sly casting, with actual lt. gary d'addario, the center of the book that gave rise to the show, playing another detective. guests drop in from other shows, like whitney allen doing her deadpan and clueless ""miss sally"" from the children's show beloved by the inmates on fontana's ""oz."" dina napoli of wbal tv turns up as herself.   even when entertaining, though, these guests can be distracting. ed begley jr. actually advances the story in his brief appearance, playing dr. victor ehrlich from fontana's ""st. elsewhere."" he's still a vivid character, and fits in a hospital setting. then you remember, didn't st. elegius turn out to be an autistic boy's fantasy?  the most useful cameo reflects corporate synergy. this movie was made when court tv bought re-run rights to the series. that network contributed legal waif helen lucaitis, who had interviewed the homicide team and later appeared on ""oz."" the tv correspondent does an efficient job summarizing the news, that is, plot points for latecomers.  although she's so thin that she disappears when she turns sideways, lucaitis also adeptly handles a bit of physical comedy with esposito. he shows more juice in his scenes with lucaitis than with any of his usual colleagues. perhaps those two should have done a spin-off.  as the movie winds down, the cream of the cast rises to the top. although they are saddled with a loser script, andre braugher and kyle secor overcome it. their performances remind viewers what made homicide, for considerable stretches, the best show on the air and one of the best television productions ever.  it's fun to watch top pros do their stuff; it's just a shame this movie doesn't give them more of a chance. die-hard fans may want to see this movie anyway, but you can live without it.",0

"soldier blue is a movie with pretensions: pretensions to be some sort of profound statement on man's inhumanity to man, on the white man's exploitation of and brutality towards indigenous peoples; a biting, unflinching and sardonic commentary on the horrors of vietnam. well, sorry, but it fails miserably to be any of those things. what soldier blue actually is is pernicious, trite, badly made, dishonest rubbish.  another reviewer here hit the nail on the head in saying that it appears to be a hybrid of two entirely different movies. what it is basically is a lame, clichéd, poorly acted ""odd couple"" romance - strauss and bergen overcoming their prejudices about the other's lifestyle and falling in love (ah, bless) - bookended by two sickening massacres which wouldn't have been out of place in a lucio fulci splatter flick.  there is no excuse for the repulsive, prurient, gore-drenched climax, in which cute little native american children are variously shot, sliced, dismembered and impaled in loving and graphic close-up, and large-breasted native american women are molested, raped and strung up - no excuse, that is, except box office. (the massacre itself, whilst repulsive in its misplaced intention, is very badly staged and shot; a bunch of actors lying around with bright red paint smeared on them, intercut with a few special-effects sequences of beheading/dismemberment - dismemberments, incidentally, which utilised real amputees in their filming. now that's what i call exploitation.)  forget all the pap you've heard (including the ludicrous commentaries that begin and end the movie) about this being a ""protest"", an indictment of american brutality towards the native peoples. this film doesn't give a stuff about the plight of the cheyenne; had it done so it would have featured some involving native american characters, would have led us to get to know and to care about the nameless, faceless innocents who get slaughtered at the climax. instead what we get is the silly white bread romance of bergen and strauss (lousy actors both, in this at least), with plenty of blood, guts and severed heads thrown in to attract the curious.  which is a terrible shame, because there is a movie to be made about the sand creek massacre, about all of the real life massacres the us (and britain, and all so-called ""civilised"" nations) have participated in over the centuries (iraq?). this just isn't that movie.",0
"this has to be the cheapest film made in 21st century. it is all the way low quality, but at the end it falls below... everything. all the cheap tricks - like flashing and darkness - are used to hide those crappy computer effects.  all the actors are below average, especially the main character anne fletcher (simmone mackinnon). there is a scene, where anne is asked: ""why you seem so careless?"" the correct answer is, because she can't act. no matter what happens (the world is about to be destroyed, her friend is dying, she is fired), she has the same stupid grin in her face.  it is not only the movie, which is b -quality. it is also the back cover description (at least in finland). the text mentions things like lorica gray -vessel, capital -vessel and main character garrison harper and anna (not anne) fletcher. the description sounds like a different movie, both featuring character called fletcher and sea monsters",0

"what was the worst movie of 2003? ""cat in the hat?"" ""gigli?"" mais non! i propose that it was this atrocious little film from earlier in the year. badly written, badly edited, and (if i may be so bold) badly acted, ""the order"" is the black hole of film - a movie so dense not even the slightest bit of entertainment could escape from its event horizon of suck. it isn't even accidentally funny, like (for example) ""showgirls.""  you know that the producers are assuming that their audience isn't going to be very smart. they renamed the movie, originally titled ""the sin eaters,"" because they figured americans were too stupid to understand what a sin eater was, even though they go to great lengths to explain what a sin eater is in the movie. instead, they figure an utterly generic title and a picture of heath ledger looking sullen are more than enough to get you in there.  and, hey, what do you know, they were right! my ex-girlfriend saw the picture of heath and dragged me in. congratulations, producers, you've met your target market. she also liked ""grease ii,"" so you're in good company.  back on topic, heath plays a catholic monk from a specific (you guessed it) order that is trying to investigate the murder of his mentor. he has celibacy issues, possibly because nobody in their right mind would believe that he knew the slightest thing about religion, much less be a celibate monk. the only other member of this order is a funny alcoholic fat guy. as much as i've wanted to see the return of the funny alcoholic to the big screen, his attempts at humor reminded me of all the dorks in my high school who did imitations of monty python, thinking that if they just said the lines like the pythons did they would automatically be funny. you know the sort of people i'm talking about.  if i utter any more, i would be in danger of generating spoilers. frankly, the thing that spoiled this movie for me was the fact that it was created.",0

"dressed to kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980: you had ""police girl"" in a role that was mega-erotic, as angie dicknson played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums (and there into apartment elevators), plus nancy allen as a call-girl, michael caine as norman bates's sophisticated new york cousin, and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period. today it's slightly less incriminating by standards and such, though the unrated version has some of the most ""hot"" content of any of de palma's films, at least in his quasi-auteur period of the 70s and early 80s, where he seemed to repeat themes over and over, ideas taken right off the film-reels of hitchcock classics and given a tawdry uplift. it's a simple tale that one partly already saw in sisters, and then again to an extent in body double, and also in blow out. cutie allen plays call-girl liz blake, who has to clear her name of suspicion of killing kate (dickinson, in full blown 'milf' mode), after being found with a razor, the murder weapon from dr. elliott's office (michael caine, stone-cold performance most of the way).  from the start, which de palma seems to do as a way of setting up a dangerous sexual fantasy scene as a way of topping the opening scene of carrie (which, perhaps, he does just in editing terms), we get a series of technical knock-out turns through the point of view of style itself: the tracking shots in the museum, meant to stir up more of a fascination with the process itself, of following and wanting to be followed, than any kind of tension; the chase through the subway (a precursor to carlito's way) is done with a precise level of suspense, meanwhile, with a slightly exploitation bit thrown in with the black gang; the character of peter, kate's son (keith gordon), who plays what is essentially a younger version of the real life de palma as a kid (science geek, obsessed with hitchcock and voyeurism). and it's all entertaining and entrancing as hell as something that comes close to a real synthesis of what makes de palma's thrillers so unique while being so self-consciously untainted by a fearless attitude of film-making.  on the other hand, that same self-consciousness ended up coming back to bite the director in the butt a few times in recent years, and somehow in dressed to kill it starts to become very erratic and disappointing as the story has to wrap itself up. as the psycho themes come together even more apparently (man who wants a sex-change, doesn't even think he's killing as it is *she* who is doing it), there is an expository scene in the police station that makes the aforementioned hitch film look like an astonishing psychological revelation. and the final scenes at peter's house, also calling painfully into recollection a much more accomplished sequence in carrie, are meant for a manipulation that even for de palma is asking for it; the final shot especially, albeit a master's class in how to copy yourself. yet there is a very deranged and, within itself, perfect scene at the mental hospital amid this confused denouement, where the doctor does some work on a nurse, to which all the other inmates act like animals in a zoo, and an over-head shot going up and up over the scene is one of the best shots of sexual/general perversion ever captured on film.  a shame then that the film ends on such a strange and unsettling manner, where up until then it is a remarkable piece of pulp cinema, where class is all around in the technical aspects (soft lighting, intricate camera movements seemingly so simple) amid subject matter that should be found in the mix of paperbacks for 25 cents. it's no masterpiece, but i'd certainly take it over most of the director's recent thrillers any day.",1
"in what is arguably the best outdoor adventure film of all time, four city guys confront nature's wrath, in a story of survival. the setting is backwoods georgia, with its forests, mountains, and wild rivers.  the director, john boorman, chose to use local people, not actors, to portray secondary characters. these locals imbue the film with a depth of characterization unequaled in film history. no central casting ""actors"" could ever come close to these people's remarkable faces, voices, or actions. i don't recall a film wherein the secondary characters are so realistic and colorful. as much as anything else, it is this gritty realism that makes this film so amazing.  another strength is the film's theme. nature, in the wild, can be violent. how appropriate that the setting should be the american south. very few places in the u.s. are, or have been, as violent as redneck country. in a story about darwinian survival of the fittest, the film conveys the idea that humans are part of nature, not separate from it.  ""deliverance"" is very much a product of its time when, unlike today, americans expressed concern over a vanishing wilderness. the film's magnificent scenery, the sounds of birds, frogs, crickets, and the roar of the river rapids, combined with the absence of civilization, all convey an environmental message. and that is another strength of the film.  at an entertainment level, the tension gradually escalates, as the plot proceeds. not even half way into the film the tension becomes extreme, and then never lets up, not until the final credits roll. very few films can sustain that level of intensity over such a long span of plot.  finally, the film's technical quality is topnotch. direction and editing are flawless. cinematography is excellent. dialogue is interesting. and the acting is terrific. burt reynolds has never been better. ned beatty is perfectly cast and does a fine job. and jon voight should have been nominated for an oscar. if there is a weak link in the film, it is the music, which strikes me as timid.  overall, ""deliverance"" almost certainly will appeal to viewers who like outdoor adventure. even for those who don't, the gritty characterizations, the acting, and the plot tension are reasons enough to watch this film, one of the finest in cinema history.",1

""the good, the bad, and the ugly"" is my all time favorite. i watched ""silverado"" for probably the 8th time just the other day because it was being featured on cmt. however, this movie, shiloh falls is without a doubt the worst western i have ever watched. the acting was terrible all around. they explain nothing at the end of the mysterious compass looking thing. the only good part i can think of is the good-looking cantina girl. the very noticeable long pauses between the dialog seemed intentional just to make up time to make the movie of acceptable length. this movie wasn't even worth the new rental fee i paid at our local movie rental store. i felt like i was robbed and deserving of a rental refund if there was such a thing. only reason i finished it was because i hate to not see a movie through to the end. i turned it off half way through because it was so bad. to the director, please do a better job if you decide to make another. this is the kind of movie that has the potential to turn people off to westerns.",0

"if any style of film could be called my ""guilty pleasure"", it'd be this generic fantasy type. guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as i'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. ""stardust"" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from neil gaiman (or gaiman adaptation, as it were). it isn't the visual dream-scape of mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of pan's labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic the princess bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.  the story of stardust involves a young man named tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. to make things difficult, however, tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.  from there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, robert deniro as a gay pirate. on that note, deniro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching deniro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting). deniro hasn't been so unique to his own image since brazil, and that's saying something.  stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. i can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. it's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.  --polarisdib",1
"modern, original, romantic story.  very good acting of both nicole kidman and ben chaplin.  miss kidman does a nice job in imitating a russian accent. ben chaplin is also good as the shy, dull clerk. for the men (and some women) : miss kidman looks fantastic and is very sympathetic. i forgot what a gorgeous woman she is. it's not hard to imagine that john falls in love with her. some unexpected turns in the story are good for the suspense. although i hoped for a happy ending, the last part of the movie was quite a surprise for me.   conclusion : good movie.   les pays-bas : huit points.",1
"if you are going to attempt building tension in a film it is always a good idea not to build it beyond the point of total tedium.  unfortunately the butcher brothers haven't grasped this yet.  this film sucks, unlike the majority of its characters who (if you didn't work out they are vampires in the first few minutes then shame on you) preference stringing up the plentiful supply of 'no one knows where i am' cheerleader types and homosexual drifters that waft conveniently and with a fast food swagger, past their isolated door.  the only tiny bit of originality in the plot is how these vampires come to be vampires in the first place but the rest of it is ludicrous and sloppy.  forced to up sticks (as opposed stakes) on a regular basis due to their penchant for filling their basement with bloodless corpses, they really are none too bright. if they fed their victims they could run their own little blood farm and it would cut down on the mortality rate, thereby allowing them to settle down and get chintzy.  why the producers felt it necessary to introduce the incestuous twins and the homicidally gay older brother i am not sure. it added zero to the plot, which was unfortunate given that there wasn't a great deal of plot to start with and had no shock value at all.  one was never told why the parents had died, unless of course that was explained during one of my frequent tea breaks. clearly the social worker must have been alerted to the family for some reason or other but again, it was for the viewer to write their own reason.  the only well rounded character was the youngest brother who emerges looking like pugsley from the adams family. indeed he was way too rounded, having the appearance of a child who has inadvertently wandered from a weight watchers' class in to a very bad horror film. oh heavens, he had. never mind dear, have another doughnut with a yummy blood centre.",0
"   what can i say? this is one of the most perfect films ever made. its a throwback to the glitxy,sterling romantic comedies of the 1940s..but with a modern touch.the screenplay bursts with wit,charm,humor and tenderness,the cinematograpy is breathtaking(nyc never looked so beautiful),and of course there is the cast! dudley moore turns in the performance of his career as loveable,drunken arthur bach. he is also wistful and real..one of the film's best lines is his poignant ""not everyone who drinks is a poet...some of us drink because we're not poets."" the great sir john gielgud won a much deserved oscar for his splendid performance as hobson,arthur's valet and caretaker.although he considered it a ""take the money and run role"",he brings to the character all the talent ,experience and bravura of an expert tragidian and a sly comedian. the supporting cast is also out of thisworld,from geraldine fitzgerald's sassy grandma bach to stephen elliott's bombastic mafioso.   the score is also extremely memorable and compliments the film perfectly.the only real problem with the film is the ill fated sequel it spawned.",1
"i was raised in a ""very christian"" household since birth. i was saved before i saw this movie and the rest of the series and was forced to watch it in a youth group at my church. this movie was highly disturbing. i saw it when i was about 12 years old and literally had nightmares about it for years. i used to lay awake in bed and listen for the sounds of my mom's footsteps upstairs. if i didn't hear her footsteps, i would sneak upstairs to make sure she hadn't been raptured. i used to pray so hard every night for salvation because i was terrified of jesus forgetting me. this is definitely not something i will show to my kids until they are much older, if at all. it took me years to shake the fear that this movie gave me.",0
"i have seen already fantastic stories, but the premises of this one are so unbelievable that it comes very close to being ridiculous. a rich and young guy undergoes a heart transplant the day after his marriage, and he is somehow witnessing his own surgery and the plot of his surgeons to kill him. even if there is a medical explanation to such a phenomenon what next happens is a mixture of dialog among ... say ... souls? ... maybe and real life where the dedicated mother will do everything to save the life of her son. there is no shade of suspense or thrill, just a combination of a bad and simplistic plot with a series of coincidences that can never happen in life.  this is not to say that the film is completely lacking quality - actually first time director joby harold does a decent job in directing a good team of actors that includes hayden christensen at his first major role after having taken off the anakin skywalker costume, fabulous jessica alba and super-gifted lena olin. all would have deserved a better story.",0
"a story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise. placed at the beginning of talkies, prix de beaute walks a thin line in being a full-on silent film -- which is still is at heart -- and flirting with sound and sound effects. the effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesn't help it at all. hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach, for example, is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs louise brooks' dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance. other than that, the movie rolls along more or less well, with little jumps in continuity here and there -- something quite common in films from this era -- and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents. in a way, this is an experiment of a movie, and closer to the style of sergei eisenstein in visual presentation and near-intimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level. louise brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for: she's a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend. her role is quite thirties and contemporary for its time; the last of the flapper/jazz baby roles were being shown on screen and now, with the onset of female independence, women as professionals were being represented in film. that brooks's character decides to leave her boyfriend (even if she does ""reconcile"" with him later) is also a little ahead of her time. however, her character's fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isn't there -- that her boyfriend wants her to succeed -- and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre. this final sequence looks like something straight out of hitchcock in its heightened suspense (seen in the man who knew too much) and cuts from brooks, her image on screen, and the murderous boyfriend. even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing ""live"" brooks with the now dead one -- a chilling effect to a chilling, powerful movie.",1
"what seemed as a good premise for a movie...unfortunately it fails to deliver on nearly every level. very hard to follow at the start of the movie i actually found myself fighting the urge to turn it off the biggest problem from a visual aspect is the fact that the camera work is simply over the top with so many ""arty"" splicings and semi-subliminal cuts throughout the movie that actually distracts you from the from the overall story. it really tries too hard to immerse you in the moment and build to a suspenseful ending but the movie just has so many half conceived characters and non relevant script it just leaves you feeling disappointed and confused as to why they tried to go so deep with it.",0
"a somewhat awkward spy mystery with a predictable plot about world war two dangers. the mystery is whether or not jane graystone (nancy coleman) has amnesia. the best acting is done by raymond massey as dr. ingersoll, a good doctor turned evil. he is head of a spy ring attempting to get information from amnesiac jane, coded information related to allied activities. will she tell? can she remember? moroni olson (as mr. goodwin) is convincing as an accomplice to massey. the role played by john garfield (as dr. lewis) is nothing short of disastrous. he seems so badly miscast that the casting has to be ranked as one of the worst in film history. it is unfortunate that so talented an actor is stuffed into a role which not befitting his talents. the movie is worth one look, despite being a half spy and half gangster film, and despite containing a parade of stereotyped characters. it's easy to forget this one, amnesia is not necessary.",0
"this is a low budget roger corman horror/creature flick. a dinocroc is created when manipulation of prehistoric genes runs amok. an engineered croc first kills one of its own then gets the taste of human and becomes a fast growing terror after escaping. none of the characters have any depth, but then they are not the focal point. we only get a few glimpses of the huge two-legged dinosaur descendant and some of the best ""kill"" scenes in a small budget film.  my favorite scene is of a moronic character trying to use a three legged dog for bait and becomes croc food himself. nothing left on the pier but ankle top feet. with no real stand out roles: jane longendecker, bruce weitz and charles napier. most pathetic is matt borlenghi and an obnoxious professional croc hunter costas mandylor. i was most impressed with the alluring joanna pacula as the respectfully feared dr. p. dinocroc is redeeming as a crock of pickles.",0
"i've read up a little bit on che before watching this film and you wanna know something, he was a real hero for the people because he only wanted to see equality for everyone and that he hated what the oppressive forces were doing to his people as well as all other latin americans in general! now, i don't know about others, but to me he did the right thing by wanting socialism so that everyone had to pay their fair share. however, the powerful elite obviously weren't going to go for that. so, rather than understanding what che guevera wanted, they were forced to kill him in attempting to suppress the revolution. it didn't work since there were too many of his other followers who only picked up where he left off. a good example of this was when castro continued his leadership in cuba. as far as i'm concerned and as che said it himself right before he died: ""if you kill me, that's fine. but you're only killing a man, you'll never kill the cause!"" i couldn't have said it any better myself.  but ... anyways.... that's why i give this film a 7 out of 10.",1
"this has got to be one of the worst fillums i've ever seen and i've seen a few. it is slow, boring, amateurish - not even consistent within its own simplistic reading of the plot. the actors do not act. i can't blame them - they have been given a script of such utter banality all they can do is trudge through it with a pain behind their eyes which has nothing to do with the evil goings on in summersisle.  there is not one moment in this film that rings true - not an honest line nor a single instant where one is moved. the nicholas cage character is so badly drawn that one feels not a smidgeon of compassion for him through all his tribulations. i have no doubt that i was seeing a suffering man up there but it was nicholas cage fully aware of the fact that he was in the worst movie of his entire career.",0

"this movie is similar to darkness falls,and the boogeyman(2005)but it's also much more graphic than both,and not as good as either.it's also slow and fairly predictable.it's also got shades of deliverance and the amityville horror.plus,we get some new age flavour thrown in the mix and some of those scenes come off as a motivational/inspirational sermon.really,this movie is a hodgepodge of almost everything.even though it is gory,the makeup effects are not very realistic looking.in fact they look kinda cheap.aside from all that,there is some really awful clichéd dialogue.and i won't say when,but there is a point where a couple of the character's actions were not authentic or believable,given the circumstances.nobody in their right mind what would have acted this way.once you watch the movie,you'll know what i mean.there's also some gratuitous nudity for nudity's sake.it just wasn't necessary at all.the good news is that the acting was actually pretty good.better than this movie deserves.so,after carefully weighing the evidence,id say this movie was passable,but not good.my verdict for the tooth fairy:4/10",0
"many have stated that orca  killer whale is a jaws rip-off. this is not really true, though the enormous commercial success of jaws undoubtedly made these man .vs. beast stories more attractive propositions for film-makers in the second half of the '70s. orca  killer whale would be better described as a modern-day retread of moby dick. it's a story about obsession. on one hand a whale's obsessive quest to avenge the death of its mate; on the other a bounty hunter's obsessive quest to kill the whale before it can claim any more lives. sadly, orca- killer whale emerges a very disappointing film, its fundamentally interesting ideas somewhat ruined by hammy performances and preposterous plotting.  shark hunter nolan (richard harris) encounters a marine-life researcher rachel bedford (charlotte rampling) diving off the atlantic coast of canada. their meeting almost ends in disaster when rachel's team are attacked by a great white shark, but a killer whale arrives in the nick of time to stop the shark. after this, nolan becomes increasingly obsessed with capturing a killer whale and selling it to an aquarium. but his plans backfire when he accidentally kills a pregnant female of the species while the distraught male looks on. rachel tells nolan that a killer whale is an incredibly intelligent mammal with a strong memory and feelings just like a human. worse still, native umilak (will sampson) warns him that the whale will always remember its grief and do everything it can to have revenge. nolan initially tries to forget about the whole regrettable incident, but the whale causes havoc in the fishing town and the disgruntled locals begin to demand that nolan puts to sea to track it down and destroy it. eventually nolan is forced to pursue the killer whale the hunt leads all the way to the desolate ice floes of the arctic ocean, where man and beast play out their final fatal battle against each other.  two things stand out in this film. one is the haunting score by ennio morricone (perhaps the greatest composer of film music of all-time, his talents wasted on various tenth-rate clunkers during the 70s and 80s). the other is the amazing widescreen photography of ted moore, which makes the film consistently pleasing to the eye. in every other department, orca  killer whale is a shoddy film that does nothing to enhance the reputation of its talented cast and crew. harris appears extremely ill throughout the film, his hair bedraggled, black rings around his eyes and skin deathly pale. his performance lacks the usual vitality. rampling strikes a lot of sexy poses but fails to convince with her long-winded and ill-informed explanations about the ways of whales. the rest of the actors are wasted in brief and undeveloped roles, the most memorable of which sees bo derek getting her leg bitten off by the vengeful whale. the plot is total nonsense from start to finish, with such preposterous sequences as the whale deliberately starting a fire in the fishing village that engulfs and destroys the local refinery! although it's credible to suppose that whales are intelligent creatures with genuine emotions, the idea that a whale could plot revenge against a single human adversary and carry it out so calculatedly is utterly absurd. orca  killer whale is really one for completists of the man .vs. beast cycle from the late 70s. most will come away from the film shaking their heads in disbelief and grinding their teeth with despair.",0
"really bad shot on video ""film"" made by not one, not two, but three amateur video makers.  if you're going to make a bad horror film at least throw in some blood, gore and nudity. there is some blood provided by latex cut off arm props bought at a halloween store. there are lesbians and hookers but no nudity or sex. the lesbians spend a lot of time in bed but only talking.  there seems to be no editing effects- fades, wipes etc. once in a while a bit of black appears to separate scenes.  terrible music by bad heavy metal bands whose websites take up the majority of the end credits.the werewolves are represented by rubber masks that are attached to just the ""actors"" face. they didn't even bother to apply brown makeup to their necks, arms or wrists.  i guarantee a 10 year old with a video camera could put together a better movie.no reason at all to buy, rent or watch this film except as an example of how not to make a low budget video.",0

"i'm a fan of both shakespeare and mst3k, so i waited anxiously to see this episode. i'll comment on the movie first, then the mst3k episode. the recipe for this movie: take talented actors, rich and beautiful shakespeare material, and a $1.25 budget. mix well, then drain of all life and movement, until dull and lifeless. serve cold in a big, plain stone cauldron. movie, i give 3 out of 10, because the actors at least deserve a little bit of credit. okay, now the mst3k episode. i'll admit it, the first time i saw it, i fell asleep halfway through. i understand that was the reaction of several other veiwers as well. however, when i watched it a second time, i realized that there was a whole host of intelligent references and good lines i missed the first time around. the trick with this episode is: listen carefully! it takes a couple of viewings to catch each line. give it a second chance, and you'll see what i mean. mst3k episode: 7 1/2 out of 10.",0
"a very high-standard columbo story which was actually the first filmed episode of the long-running series but was originally transmitted second (after ""murder by the book"").  robert culp makes his first of three appearances as the guest murderer in the series and plays the owner of a private detective agency, who blackmails the wife (patricia crowley) of a rich, highly influential businessman (played very sympathetically by ray milland) after he falsifies a report, in her favour, after it is discovered she was having an affair. the wife later rebels against the blackmail scheme but is killed in a fit of rage....  a very satisfying episode in many respects, particularly as the plot is so strongly set-up and subsequently developed and also because of the rare columbo ingredient that the crime is an unpremeditated killing. the whole thing is further enhanced when the widowed husband uses the murderer to assist columbo in his investigations: a feature that facilitates numerous good quality scenes, particularly in the first sequence when the three central characters meet and columbo's crucially deceptive qualities are wonderfully in evidence.  directed with flair by bernard l. kowalski and acted to an appropriately high level, this really set the tone for whole series (since ""murder by the book"" was let down by a poor ending). the script by columbo creators richard levinson and william link is precise, well-structured and well-thought-out and is underpinned by a steady, productive pace and meaningful sequences which really exhibit the unpredictability of the story. ultimately, the finale fittingly epitomises that columbo has always been one step ahead of the murderer.  overall, this is a very fine piece of detective work for columbo, and strongly suggests that the production team had worked positively and constructively to render a polished columbo story.",1
"initially, i would have thought that secret sunshine had something critical to say of religion (and here being christianity), and wondered if it would be something of a rant against the ills of blind faith, or the manipulative power of those who are supposedly holier than thou. surprisingly, it was none of the sort and was largely non-judgemental, putting in place events as a matter of fact, and allowing the audience to draw their own judgement and conclusion.  and i can't help but to chuckle at the role of song kang-ho, a man who's taken a liking for widower shin-ae (jeong do-yeon), and starts going to church when she does. the reasons for church going are many i suppose, either to find inner peace, to seek help, being afraid of eternal damnation in the fires of hell, to reaffirm faith, or even things like wanting to get married in a church, or to skirt chase (i kid you not). but to each his own reasons for turning up in church every sunday and participating in prayer groups for fellowship, what is indeed dangerous, is when the underlying ulterior motives, do not get satisfied, and that's when frustration sets in. or when you discover how hypocritical man can be, portraying one face inside the house of god, and displaying yet another outside.  shin-ae and her son jun moves to the town of miryang, which is the birthplace of her deceased husband. wanting to start life anew, she opens up a piano shop to give lessons, though in discovering her new found freedom and in a moment's lack of good judgement, has another tragedy befall her. and that takes one hour to get to. secret sunshine really took its time to get to this point, where things then begin to get slightly more interesting with shin-ae now taking to embracing religion to deal with and accept her current state, reveling in the comfort that religion, and fellow believers, can offer.  what began as crying out for sympathy turns into acceptance and belief that religion offers that silver bullet to solve the ills of all mankind, and sometimes you wonder if it's because of your personal myopic view of what the almighty is doing for you, that you begin to adopt a somewhat selfish opinion that everything's good going your way, and in shin-ae's case, her magnanimous attitude in wanting to forgive others who had trespassed against her, forgetting something very fundamental that it the feeling can cut both ways too.  the last act is probably the most fun of the lot as it says plenty, where most of us can identify with - why me, and why not someone else, as we rage against our faith and start questioning, unfortunately, with no hard and fast answers available. it is then either we fall by the wayside, or continue with destructive deeds so rebelliously. but somehow the plug gets carefully pulled in secret sunshine so as not to offend, and what could have been an ugly character mouthpiece, got muted.  if you bite into the hype this movie is generating, then perhaps you'll realize only jeong do- yeon's excellent portrayal is worth mentioning, as she totally owns her role as the widow shin-ae who is probably the most unluckiest person on earth in having to deal with that many tragedies over a short period of time, and if you look at it carefully, most of which are of her own doing. watching her transformation, is worth the ticket price, and despite having my personal favourite korean actor song kang-ho in the movie, this is something he just breezed right through.",1
"i don't understand your objections to this movie. it is a taut, thrilling extension of the character created in ""basic instinct"". the only part of the story that is the least bit unrealistic, is the fact that sharon stone's character is still alive and not in jail at this late date.  spoiler alert: as the movie progresses, we are presented with three theories of what is going on: 1) sharon stone's character is killing all these people because she's crazy (risk addicted); 2) david thewlis' crooked cop is killing these people in order to frame sharon stone's character; 3) david morrissey's analyst is killing these people for revenge. what upsets most people about the movie seems to be that none of these theories are ever explicated as the ""real"" story. (although the analyst is in a psychiatric care facility for killing the cop; the only killing that occurs on screen.)  i think this is a brilliant plot device in the spirit of ""2001, a space odyssey."" who cares what is real? the blonde really is crazy, the cop really is crooked and the analyst really wants revenge. what's important is the interactions between these and other characters in the story. like real life, everyone is more complicated than anyone thinks and reality is more complicated than a movie. get over it!",1

"...heads, hands, and feet - a band from the past, just like strange fruit. a triple whammy there. those who have professed not to like this film are either heartless or under 40, and have had no experience of the real thing. sad for them. this is an achingly well-observed little picture that is an excellent way of passing an hour or two, and will probably not even fade much on the second showing. stephen rae, timothy spall as the fat drummer (in many ways quite the most delightful figure of all), and bill nighy - a new name for me - as the neurotic vocalist and front man all turn in super performances, and juliet aubrey has lovely doe eyes to go with some sharp acting as karen, who tries to hold the band together as they spectacularly self-destruct.  the syd barrett/brian wilson echoes are loud and clear, mott the hoople rear up before one in all their inflated ridiculousness, and the script is never mawkish for more than a minute. don't compare this with spinal tap or the rutles or the full monty - it's unfair on all of them. the nearest comparison is the commitments, and that's no bad thing. and any film that can conjure up memories of blodwyn pig - a band i do not remember ever seeing, but the name lives on - well, it shows somebody in the team knew what they were on about.  a small delight, and thanks for the memory.  oh... and i've got another one - stiff little fingers; a-a-and what about steeleye span... spooky tooth... ten inch nails anyone?

"i really wanted to like this movie, but it was just imposable. the acting was ultra hammy, the plot was annoying, and the pace was slow, sooo slowwwwww. the whole time sitting in the theater i wanted the movie to end. twenty minuets into a films and i'm praying for an ending. sure some of the visuals were nice, but c'mon guys, i mean really! and for a movie about a guy tuning magical instruments there really wasn't much music to speak of. the music there was was annoying, and boring. there were sound loud shrill sounds at times too, those were also annoying. mainly this film managed to bore me, and creep me out at the same time.  i'm glad its over. i need to go see ""tideland"" and wash this bad taste out of my mouth.",0
i really liked this movie! even though it wasn't anything like any of the books it still the that classic nancy drew style. i had been seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie and since i was really into the nancy drew books i had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations. pretty much all of the characters were exactly how i pictured them from reading the books. i am really happy that i saw this movie. all of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series. ever since i saw this movie i have wanted to read every single nancy drew book there is out there. all of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen. it definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in i most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10.,1
"despite the acclaim on the dvd cover of the version i borrowed, this film was a disappointment. yes, it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud, boredom and frustration of the grunt, but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking that's all there is to this movie. there is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous. it's not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute. one of the best world war ii films, ""twelve o'clock high,"" has very little action. but it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension. the exception to ""the story of g.i. joe"" is a brief battle segment (titled ""city under siege"" on the dvd) which takes place in italy. admittedly it is one of the most fast-paced and convincing combat scenes of any war movie. but alas, the rest of the film is not worth watching just for this highlight. another turn-off is pvt. dondaro, played by wally cassell, who is meant to be a ""romeo"" but comes off a pervert. by contrast, sgt. warnicki is a sympathetic, if flawed, man. as he says to capt. walker (mitchum) when volunteering for another patrol: ""every step forward is a step closer... to home."" but that last step  one patrol too many  drives him over the mental brink. too bad the rest of the movie doesn't do justice to some otherwise fine touches. as for meredith's portrayal of pyle... it is practically comatose.",0
"i'm a huge classic film buff, but am just getting in to silent movies. a lot of silent films don't hold my attention, but show people is a notable exception.  marion davies and william haines are simply wonderful in this picture. davies, in particular, shows a wide range as she morphs from a giggly small town girl to a starlet who takes herself a bit too seriously.  show people is a fast paced film with a fantastic array of cameos by some of the biggest stars of the silent era. the movie captured my attention immediately and i actually forgot that it was a silent film. (i know that doesn't make much sense, but that's what happened.) the actors are so skilled in their craft that few dialogue cards are necessary.  show people is a perfect introduction to silent films. it is a fast paced, interesting film with two of the silent era's best stars. add in the satire of hollywood and show people should be on the 'must see' list for all classic film buffs.",1

"it's a shame that deliverance is mainly known as the redneck rape movie and for dueling banjos. even people that have seen the film can't get their mind off of that rape scene. it's not as bad as the rape scene in pulp fiction. it's certainly not as bad as any female rape scene in just about any movie. people tend to miss the power of the film that contains the infamous buggery scene.  the acting, plot, cinematography, and soundtrack of deliverance all lend a hand to it's brooding charisma. the backcountry it was shot in is beautiful and is quite in contrast to the dark subject matter. the actors both major and minor make you feel like you are rafting down that river right along with them.   the thing that separates this film from others is the tangible sense of dread that it inspires. not many films can make you feel this creeped out. bottom line: this movie is a classic. i can't really say much more than that.",1
"although this show has been off the air since 1973, after viewing a dvd set i borrowed at our library, i felt compelled to say a bit about it.  i can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s, and sometimes there would be a little ""sunday night party"" with friends to watch this on nbc on one of the few color televisions.  i really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time. case in point: virginia city, nevada, which became one of the richest cities in the world because of the silver, got its name from a character named ""old virginny"", who, in the town's early days, stumbled out of a saloon, fell and broke his whiskey bottle.  old virginny didn't want to waste the occasion so as the precious liquid was seeping into the dirt he decided to christen the town ""virginia town"". the area became known as the comstock lode because another character, henry comstock, had the reputation of trying to jump everyone's claim and the area became known as the comstock lode.  i just watched an early episode that dealt with these 2 subjects. other episodes dealt with mark twain's literary rise while a reporter for the territorial enterprise...  it was wholesome (and frequently educational) family entertainment. as someone else remarked, each episode would really be considered a movie in its own right - rich scripts and characters.   one thing it twisted the truth on was the proximity to virginia city and the ponderosa. in truth, to ride from the ponderosa (all of northern lake tahoe), one would have to ride his horse about 3,000 feet (1,000 meters) down the spooner summit to the high desert (3,000-4,000 feet) of the carson valley then another 30-40 miles to virginia city.  needless to say the cartwrights would have some sore rear ends doing this on a regular basis. but every writer should have some leeway with the truth.  how i miss that show, even today.",1
"when in rome is a definite improvement on getting there. getting there i found too predictable, contrived and slow, and to this day i still consider it as the olsen twins' worst. however, while when in rome isn't a terrible movie, it's not a great one either. if i had to sum it up in one word, i would say passable. it is good fun for teenagers, but i think adults won't find much to go on.  when in rome does have its good points. mary kate and ashley olsen are actually quite decent actresses, certainly very pretty as well. i will admit when i was 10 or so, i really liked them, and in general i kind of like them still. and i have enjoyed some of their movies like passport to paris and new york minute. back on target, both girls don't do that bad a job, in fact they are very appealing. plus their outfits are to die for, and the scenery of rome is absolutely breathtaking. the soundtrack ain't half bad either.  however, where the film is brought down is in the plot and the script. the script is on the most part clichéd and has hints of deja vu. the plot, like most of the mary kate and ashley movies, is very predictable, and anyone familiar with any other of the olsen twins' work, will find some rather unoriginal elements to it. most of the characters are cardboard thin, and you don't learn very much about them, and sometimes the pace is uneven. sadly, the breathtaking scenery is spoilt by rather slapdash camera work, that looked rushed constantly.  all in all, does have its good points, and certainly watchable. however, for my taste, it is harmless and predictable teenage fluff. 4/10 bethany cox",0

"i agree with the previous comment in naming the film's content ""everyday madness"" but would like to specify that: ""dog days"" is about how women are treated in (a male) society. the episodes we get to see here show some variation in everyday discrimination of women, mostly categorized by age group. there is a senior man who makes his new partner look and act the way his late wife had, treating her like a doll that shall act ""worthy of wearing"" the former's dress. there is a middle-aged couple in whose relationship she is nearly a slave and he a (violent) master. further we find a somewhat younger man who does not communicate with his friend/wife and instead of being really jealous about her affairs even makes friendship with his competitor(s). a young adult man makes clear to his friend - a girl who is really troubled by being pretty enough for him - that she has to be the jewelry at his side and to follow his narrow viewed rules of etiquette. finally there is a man in his late fifties who calculating his own advantage delivers a simple-minded hitchhiking woman to a furious client who - taking her for guilty in having scratched his car - natural beats her up. to complete the examples we find the pal of the man in the ""master-slave""-couple - after collectively abusing her - threatening and humiliating the former ""in her sake"" for she shall get rid of her partner and take himself as her new ""master"". during all this the inhabitants of the lately built neighborhood in which the action takes place rests under the burning summer-sun - absolutely motionless (sic!). unfortunately i have not seen the last minutes of this shocking and authentic portray of the archaic structures that still reign in the relationship between women and men, but what i have seen convincingly analyzed the repertoire of discrimination. probably a helpful tool in teaching even the less sensitive spectator what goes wrong - due to good visualization.",1
"i've never been a huge fan of mormon films. being a mormon, i've always felt that the humor was too exclusive to the lds community and made us seem like a bunch of obsessive wackos. i was hoping this would be the breath of fresh air, the halestorm movie i could finally discuss with my non-mormon friends.  boy, was i wrong.  i figured, since this had b-list talent like clint howard, gary coleman, andrew wilson, and fred willard (one of my favorites), this would have to be at least a little funny. and besides, church basketball is ripe with potential for plenty of hilarious gags and such. but i must say, throughout the entire movie, it seemed as though no one knew what they were doing. every joke fell flat, and every opportunity for a genuinely funny gag went ignored. the dialogue was bland, and the film had some of the worst character development i have ever seen. every single character but wilson's was less than one-dimensional. it's hard to believe that after nine re-writes the film was still as mind-numbingly stale as the train wreck i witnessed. i can't put into words the rage i felt sitting through this. my friends and i were extras in the final game scene, so we went to the premiere in washington city, ut. kurt hale, the director, was there, and i must say, i avoided all contact with him after the show. he waited at the door, seemingly ready for feedback. i couldn't bring myself to tell him that his film not only ripped away a good hour and a half of my life, but it left a nasty, painful scar that i will never forget.  here are a few specific problems i had: there was a minor love story subplot between the janitor and the chubby piano player, but these two characters came out of nowhere, and were impossible to care about, so my friends and i were left constantly wondering why we were supposed to care about these two lame, uninteresting characters. there were many subplots that popped up every now and then, each promising the audience the chance for laughs, but each one came and went in a puff of smoke, ending before you could even start caring. this was pretty much how the whole movie felt.  this film was a major letdown, and i feel bad for everyone who's expecting the first real funny mormon movie. true, the jokes in this one aren't too exclusive to mormons. then again, it's hard to tell what was a joke and what was a loud ringing sensation in my ears.  please, do not see this movie. keep in your mind the fantasy that this movie is hilarious. spare yourself the disappointment i went through",0
"don't know if this contains any spoilers or not, but i don't want to risk being blacklisted until the year 3462.  i disagree entirely with the viewer comments that have described *guns, germs and steel* as ""politically correct"" and ""neo-marxist."" they cannot have watched the same series that *i* did.  the series *i* watched depicted the history of european colonisation in the americas and southern africa with no particular inaccuracies. i saw nothing in the series that portrayed europeans as bad people who happened to be lucky, though europeans often *were* lucky - and there's nothing wrong with luck. neither did i see native peoples portrayed as poor little innocent things. if anything, the inca was rather arrogant - as you would expect any leader would be when dealing with foreigners, if his country has not been conquered in living memory by any other world power.   i certainly saw nothing that could be construed as marxist or neo-marxist, except by the most incredibly elastic of imaginations.  otherwise, many african peoples *do* have a built-in immunity to malaria and other tropical diseases that europeans lack. at the time they were at the height of their successes, the aztec, maya and inca civilisations *were* as advanced as any other in the world - and as wealthy; sometimes more so. aboriginal american and khoi-san populations *were* decimated by smallpox and other diseases introduced by europeans; just as european colonists were decimated by tropical diseases like malaria. (note: the khoi-san peoples are completely different from all other sub-saharan african peoples.)   so, i don't see what some of the other commentators are complaining about. the only thing *i* can find to complain about is that the series doesn't tell me anything i did not know by the time i finished seventh grade. there's really nothing new in the way of historical information in this film. it does, however, present some nice dramatisations of events, such as the conquest of the incas; the production values are very high; and it fills in a few holes here and there that didn't get covered in mrs. gruber's sixth hour social studies class at milan middle school.  if you rent or buy this, assuming you had a decent primary and/or secondary school education, you won't learn anything new, but you will have an enjoyable and entertaining time reviewing what you already learned (or should have learned) by the time you hit high school.",1
"i'm the sort of person who went down to the local library and read books on babbage's difference engine whilst my schoolmates were playing football etc.. so, if there is any such thing as a target audience for this film, then i guess i'd probably be included in that.  maybe i just need to watch it again. a previous reviewer mentioned not to watch this film whilst being tired. maybe that was my mistake.  i tried my best to enjoy this film, and there are aspects of it that i do like, but overall i found it amateurish and quite plodding.  being somewhat of a self confessed computer nerd, i just can't help but pick up on the exact time frame when the movie was actually made, and how the employed graphics reflect that time (i.e. 1997). having played games of the era c.f. ""mind grind"" to cite one example, this film cannot escape that 16-bit colour low res multimedia explosion of that time. now thankfully this has somewhat lessened in more recent years in the gaming world at least, in favour of actual game play.  having to resort to watching this movie via a german fta satellite channel (as i don't think it's ever been aired on uk fta tv, well not recently anyway), i was mildly amused to see the end credits note gottdog (god dog) had 4 people working on it's design. maybe it's mean spirited of me to be amused by this, given that ten years have elapsed since the movie was made, nevertheless the end result makes movie graphics from the eighties look good by comparison.  but, as for the main story, i agree that the format isn't the best idea. like others i agree that ada deserves a film without the sci-fi angle, and a more straightforward biographical approach would perhaps be better suited to covering the life story of this remarkable lady.  there are fundamental mistakes that undermine my enjoyment of this movie. first of all the underlying idea that somehow lost real-world information from the past can be accurately reconstructed through some sort of extrapolation via software based intelligent agents, seems somehow ludicrous.  also, the theme running through the movie that a computing device can indeed predict the mechanics of all things through the course of time (e.g. the winds) is now known not to be the case.  ok, so the victorians may have held this view, but the 20th century works of gödel proving that no mathematical system can be complete, turing's works on the limits of computability, not to mention chaos theory and quantum mechanics, have all completely undermined these ideas, which seem central to how the modern day researcher's software is supposed to work.  finally, the clicking of the mouse in the air to mean ""programming"" is also just plain wrong, as previously mentioned.  this film maybe could have been ok, but at least some technical and scientific consultation would have given the film some much needed credit in the believability stakes.  i won't forget the film though, as like ""pi"", it is clearly a unique work, but with too many fatal mistakes for me to truly enjoy it, 3/10 from me.",0
"i agree with all the accolades, i went through a box of tissues watching this film. it had a gritty authenticity and rang true in every way.  the question i'm about to raise represents a current sensibility regarding the treatment of animals. i had a very difficult time with the beginning slaughter of sheep and goats, and the dying deer with its pulsing neck and pooling blood as its life drained away was hideous.  this is the age of ""no animals were hurt in the production of this move."" iphigenia was made in the late 70's before the advent of computer simulation. was it possible to fake these animal deaths? or were these animals slaughtered for art?",1
"certainly nomad has some of the best horse riding scenes, swordplay, and scrumptious landscape cinematography you'll likely see, but this isn't what makes a film good. it helps but the story has to shine through on top of these things. and that's where nomad wanders.  the story is stilted, giving it a sense that it was thrown together simply to make a ""cool"" movie that ""looks"" great. not to mention that many of the main characters are not from the region in which this story takes place (and it's blatantly obvious with names like lee and hernandez). if movie makers want to engross us in a culture like the jugars and the kazaks, they damn well better use actors/actresses that look the part.  warring tribes, a prophecy, brotherly love and respect, a love interest that separates our ""heroes"", are all touched on but with so little impact and screen time that most viewers will brush them aside in favor of the next battle sequence, the next action horse scene, or the breathtaking beauty of the landscape.  it is worth mentioning that there were some significant changes made to nomad during its filming, specifically the director and cinematographer. ivan passer (director) was replaced by sergei bodrov, and ueli steiger (cinematographer) was replaced by dan laustsen. in one respect, laustsen seems to have the better eye since his visions of the lands made the final cut that we see here. definitely a good thing. however, the changing over to bodrov as director may not have been the wisest choice. from what i'm seeing here, the focus is on the battles and not the people, which i sense comes from bodrov's eyes and not passer's. a true travesty.  the most shameful aspect is that this could've been a really fantastic film, with both character and action focuses. unfortunately, the higher-ups apparently decided that action was what was needed and took the cheap (intellectually speaking) way out.  even though i can't give this film a positive rating, it is worth watching simply for the amazing cinematography work. but that's all.",0

"being a transplanted new yorker, i might be more critical than most in watching city hall. but i have to say that before even getting to the story itself i was captivated by the location shooting and the political atmosphere of new york city that director harold becker created.  for example there's a reference to woerner's restaurant in brooklyn where political boss frank anselmo likes to eat. there is or was a woerner's restaurant on remsen street in downtown brooklyn when i lived in new york back in 1996. it was in fact particularly favored by political people in the borough though they did have a couple of other hangouts.  no surprise because the script was co-authored by nicholas pileggi who still writes both political and organized crime stories. he knows the atmosphere quite well and he sure knows how those two worlds cross as they do in this film.  a detective played by nestor serrano goes for an unofficial meeting with a relative of mob boss anthony franciosa and things erupt and three people wind up dead, including an innocent 6 year old boy whose father was walking him to school. the story mushrooms and at the end it's reached inside city hall itself.  al pacino plays mayor john pappas and john cusack is his deputy mayor a transplanted louisianan, a state which has a tradition of genteel corruption itself. he's the outsider here and in trying to do damage control, cusack finds more than he bargained for,  danny aiello plays brooklyn political boss frank anselmo and for those of you not from new york, his character is based on the late borough president of queens donald manes who was also brought down by scandal. he's very much the kind of brooklyn politician i knew back in the day whose friendship with organized crime and favors done for them, do aiello in.   city hall was the farewell performance on film for anthony franciosa, one of the most underrated and under-appreciated talents ever on the screen. no one watches anyone else whenever he's on.  al pacino's best moment is when at the funeral of the young child killed, he takes over the proceedings and turns it into a political triumph for himself. his is a complex part, he's a decent enough man, but one caught up in the corruption it takes to rise in a place like new york.   for those who want to know about political life in the big apple, city hall is highly recommended.",1
"city hall is a somewhat mixed bag. part vignettes of nyc political life, and part moralizing tale. al pacino, a dukakis-esque boss with presidential dreams, gives an oft times sullen or subdued performance. there's a couple times when he chews the scenery, and in the case of city hall, this is where he shines. john cusack gives a subdued and generally flawless performance, without going into caricature of a new orleans dialect, or sliding into melodrama during the films climax. danny aiello as a burrough political chief, is also very good. i love showtunes, too.  the major problem with city hall, and it is a good movie in many ways, is the general feeling of a lack of momentum. it comes off more like a documentary, than a motion picture. we see the action or follow the story from a detached perspective, and naturally, the viewer doesn't become involved. when the viewer doesn't get involved to a certain degree, they become apathetic towards the characters, and eventually, the plot.  this tends to alienate, and what should have been a riveting, detail divulging finale, came off as a ""hmmm...uh...okay."" they say you ""can't fight city hall,"" as the tread worn cliche goes. yet, it still can't stop you from thinking what might have been, if they had just tightened up the screenplay and pacing of this movie.",1
"i don't know who wrote the script for this movie, but from the first moment on, i was irritated. of all possible decisions they could make up in the mountains, why do they make the decision, which is the most dangerous of all? why do the criminals act dumb, although they managed to get a huge amount of money out of a bank and get away with it? why doesn't the main criminal land the helicopter, shoot stallone, grab the money and fly away with the chick as a hostage? and there are more cases of illogical behavior. i'd give this movie 5 points for nice action and great landscape scenery, but due to the illogical behavior of the characters, i just can give this movie 1 point...",0
"so they hyped the violence and it's been branded as sick. well, the violence is the best bit i'm afraid, but unfortunately the characters are not developed enough to allow us to understand why they go on their (entirely predictable) rampage. this film has a truly dreadful script. we never get a chance to get to know robert and his actions at the end are just plain pathetic. the acting isn't much better, either, the worst of them being the tv chef and the school teacher. the direction is clumsy, the pace enough to send you to sleep. and what on earth is the school film project all about? a comment on the film itself perhaps? the use of newsreel during the climactic murder is laughable. these guys obviously think they're intellectuals but are hopelessly out of their depth. how on earth they got the great yorgos arvanitis to light it i'll never know. and how they got the money to make it in the first place is an even greater mystery. absolutely awful beyond comprehension.",0
"as an native of bolton, this film has obvious appeal for me. the location shots are fascinating and show a bolton very much in transition - there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt - and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film. a slightly miscast james mason leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a full-blown generational conflict, then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution. though i'm a bit too young to remember it fully, the minutiae of lancashire life in the 60s is all here: cashing up on a friday, songs round the piano, the sunday constitutional, good neighbourliness, the trepidations of courtship, the massive importance of self-respect, and i was pleased to see naughton's funniest lines from the play left intact. there is no doubt that this film ought to be made available on dvd - it is well crafted and most performances are well realised.",1
"may contain spoilers...but doubt it can actually be spoilt!!.  five across the eyes can be summed up in one word....amateurish. this film tries it's best to be different from most films by the 'blair witch' type of filming....it doesn't work....it just ends up looking and feeling like somebody had a cheap video camera, a van and decided to make a movie. the story has no explanation, the protagonist is given no real motivation (and looks like a lesbian wearing a power-suit compared to the five girls) and there is no violence to speak of...just the sounds of screaming and crunching. the whole film takes place inside a van which means decent scenery is out of the question. the five girls really do their best with what they've been given but on the whole come across as pretty terrible actresses...although with the material given it's hard to judge if they can actually act....they spend the whole movie screaming, squealing and whimpering....so much that half the time it's hard to make out what was said and the cameras are so bad it's actually hard to tell who said it. this video paints itself as a violent torture film but is in fact just five girls in a van screaming in terror...that literally sums up the whole movie.....we then get to the end after what seems like 5 hours of constant screaming and all five girls are still alive... with one minus a finger. the only thumbs up(get it...finger....lol) is for the poor actresses who tried hard and probably lost their voices(and their pride) after making this terrible movie. do not judge this by the poster....you'll be very let down.",0
"no real plot to this one, just a series of short skits acting out some very old jokes. i chuckled once or twice in the beginning, much to my chagrin. but even at only 73 minutes this film wears out it's welcome before too long and becomes stale and tedious (with some nudity sprinkled in here and there to keep you awake). still as bad as this movie is (and that's pretty putrid), it's a comedic gem compared to pretty much anything by aaron seltzer & jason friedberg (date movie, epic movie, meet the spartans) also the song is sadly kind of catchy in a sad way.  eye candy: 11 pair of tits, 3 bushes, 3 asses   my grade: d   code red dvd extras: original trailer for this film; and trailers for ""beyond the door"", ""dead pit"", ""the farmer"", ""obsessed ones"", ""power play"", ""sole survivor"", & ""wacky taxi""",0

"this was a new alltime low among westerns. the writing is excruciatingly bad, characters are impossible to emphasize with and are either disgusting or bland, the violence is appalling and technically not very convincingly executed. and tobey maguire shows us the flip side of his talent, sleepwalking through his part with those expressionless eyes and that raspy voice of his that here betrays only mannerism. 'ride with the devil' is among my five worst movie experiences ever, a western never to be surpassed in the negative respect.",0
"i remember when this came out a lot of kids were nuts about it. i guess i was a bit too old to get all excited and i was a fan of real martial arts films and always found this a bit cheesy.  in the early 90's we were swamped with programs such as this making kids feel like they could fight and be a power ranger or an equal to these kids on 3 ninjas. i think eventually parents and film makers alike got sick of it because all we had in reality was abunch of kids going around punching and hitting everyone.  many kids movies have some big point they're trying to make and its nice for your kids to watch and get the message, this one doesn't have any message at all...it just exploits a million difference things in less than 90 minutes.  the movie has no great visual qualities but would one expect it to? the acting is pretty bad. victor wong is a cool actor but it was embarrassing to see him here.. the short, fat, gimped eyed old fart as a powerful ninja that was just hilarious. the kids over acted way too much and the youngest ninja tum tum was maybe the worst kid actor i have ever seen.  the movie has a plot that anyone knows before they even read the review. 3 ninjas...yea you know they're gonna fight a bunch of bad guys and win obviously... need i say more. sorry if i spoiled it for anyone.  with all that said kids will love it. this movie is aimed at kids and only children could enjoy it. if you don't mind your kid seeing movies about kids fighting this is a good movie to let them see. if you don't mind allowing your children to see complete garbage that has nothing to do with real martial arts, real acting or reality period then you have found a movie for your kids... i say kids because i think even the girls will like it... i recall all the girls having a crush on rocky.  2 out of 10 stars because i think you can make a movie for kids and still make it enjoyable for adults..this movie failed big time at that.. it is beyond cheesy and nothing original or unique and i would not allow a child of mine to watch it... kung fu the tv series is on dvd and there's tons of great shaw brothers films out there...why not show your children things that will really entertain them and not make them dumb along the way, perhaps even teach them some moves and not just how to kick a man between the legs as grandpa did on 3 ninjas...no no no...never kick a man between the legs ...never .. thats so unninja like.",0
"the radar men from the moon is a pretty typical fare of 1950's serials. the special effects are pretty cheap, the lunar rovers are obviously world war ii surplus jeeps with painted plywood over them, and the like. the acting is only so-so. it does inspire the imagination of children, to whom i believe this was directed to. by today's standards, it's boring, cheap, and bad. there's also a hefty amount of stock footage in the first 9 episodes of natural disasters.",0
"pierce brosnan will probably be the only thing familiar in richard attenborough's new biopic. the rest is new to international audiences: canadian history and first nations culture.  ""grey owl"" is a light examination of how an man came to be adopted into the ojibway of northern ontario, learning and preaching environmentalism decades before it became politically correct to do so. the film contains a love story, a moral message, and a man tortured by his past. that torture, though, is not always brought to life with the dramatic impact that it might.  nevertheless, it is a film which holds its audience without any violence. it pays deep respect to canada's first nations, and presents them in a dignified and non-stereotypical manner. brosnan's performance is somewhat stiff, but i suspect that's just how lord attenborough wanted him.  thanks from a proud canadian.",1
"i have always been a fan of the show so i'll admit that i am biased. when the show's run ended, i felt like too many questions remained unanswered. this movie to me felt like closure. to see all the people i'd followed over the past few years together at last was most rewarding. i have heard that this is probably the only homicide movie that we can expect. if that is so, this is the appropriate way to go out. this movie is sometimes poignant, sometimes upsetting, but always satisfying. if you are or ever have been a fan of the show, watch this movie.",1

"major spoilers!! this is for people who have seen the movie!!  commenters have touched on the major theme of ""honor"" in the film, and too many comparisons to ""braveheart."" i'll point out a few things about this movie that i have not seen other comments touch on:  this movie has a decidedly different take on abortion. the first character to get pregnant is the villain's (roth) girlfriend, and when he coldly suggests an abortion, she states it is too late for that. the shame of her situation (""i'm to have a bastard's bastard."") leads her to commit suicide in a much later scene. the second character to find herself pregnant is mary, rob's wife, after a rape by roth's character (and at least one sex scene with her husband, rob). late in the movie, as rob is leaving for a final confrontation with roth, mary asks what she should do about the pregnancy of questionable origins, with a tone hinting of abortion. rob replies in a noble tone, ""it's not the fault of the child,"" and then states what he thinks the name should be, girl or boy. i find this ""pro-life"" stance on the part of the hero to be very un-hollywood. rob walks from the darkness of the house to the bright outside to make this comment -- not coincidental symbolism.  another related theme is roth's character is a bastard, someone who evidently does not know who his father was, and has few kind words for his mother, though he wears a picture of her in a case hung from his neck. is it coincidence that roth (devoid of family stability) is the walking definition of psychopath, while rob is the strong husband/father figure, and of course the hero. in the final sword fight between rob and the villain (roth), the former slices the latter deeply across the chest -- the left side of the chest, over the heart. his employer and pseudo-father figure (john hurt character) holds the mother's picture in his hand and gazes at it, before snatching it from the neck of the dead roth.  also what i find interesting was the direction of the rape scene, which was not quite graphic but neither was it off-camera and implied. i found it surprising in it's somewhat matter of fact depiction, with mary convincingly showing the characteristics of someone going through the ordeal, and subsequent post traumatic stress (as we call it now). my point being that the rape was neither sensationalized nor just implied, which i find an interesting middle road for hollywood to take.  in the final fight scene, i have to correct an earlier commenter: the weapon roth chose was a rapier (or perhaps a short sword), the weapon rob chose was a claymore. someone was really doing their homework on this entire scene. roth would have the upper hand in such a situation, but of course the claymore is a distinctly scottish weapon. what is even more striking to me (as a fencer and someone who has read a bit on the subject) is that this final sword fight is one of the most convincing of any film ever made: the actors seem actually trying to kill each other -- not the usual slashes to the opponents blade we see in most movie fights (including the movies opening fight). even more true to history, roth is seen several times using the rapier as a thrusting weapon, which is it's purpose by design! (rapiers were edged, but primarily a thrusting weapon with the edges used mainly for parrying an opponents thrust.) rob uses the claymore in broad slashes, as it's design intent. the fight goes down as i would expect it to -- roth effectively wins. though rob wins the day by grabbing roth's weapon (more symbolism) and striking him dead with a powerful slashing cut.  folks, it is rare to see this level of historical accuracy in a movie sword fight.  i'll also note that for whatever reason, i remember 1995 (the year of release) distinctly as a time of distrust of the u.s. government. hollywood was obviously tuned into that, with the release of both ""rob roy"" and ""braveheart,"" and i think the anti-government leanings are why both films get so much comparison.   i think the different perspective that this film gives is refreshing to avid movie fans, tired of the same old, not so hidden messages from hollywood.",1
it is an almost ideal romantic anime! must see for all ages! but the english dubbed version is not too good. perhaps the 1999 version will be better.,1
"""zabriskie point"" (1970): this was especially interesting to me on a personal level, since it takes place under identical circumstances, with identical peers, in my own life  the counter culture movement of the late 60's/early 70's, on and off campus. we follow two unrelated young people in separate stories, who are slowly woven together. one is a young man in los angeles, tired of all the endless, pseudo-revolutionary jabber in the classrooms and lunchrooms of his campus, and, the other, a young woman driving to phoenix to see her father & employer, and take on an ""establishment"" job. the film is full of our italian director's (michelangelo antonioni) visual notations of america, and, the confused, psychedelicrazies of that era's self-righteous, ""we know it all, we'll change everything for the better"" youth. just who is the ""revolutionary""? what does that really mean? do you dress like one and march around chanting? do you ""fly in under the radar"" but give advance notice of your arrival? do you keep your plans to yourself, and go about the business of change, with no need for group approval? ""zabriskie point"" is definitely a ""period piece"" - full of slang, uniforms, somewhat surreal film moments (after all, this is a film by the man who gave us the amazing ""blow up"" of 1966), and the era's artifacts, but it is more. it presents options for cultural revolution, and going by antonioni (who does seem to be supportive of it), the youth are too self-involved to see what is needed for radical success. because of this, it becomes a powerful, frightening film that applies to anyone, any time, any place.",1
"the minute i started watching this i realised that i was watching a quality production so i was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by andrew davis and was produced by sue birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of pride and prejudice! so my only gripe here is that emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like pride and prejudice. the acting was superb with i think prunella scales excellent as miss bates but i loved kate beckinsale and mark strong just as much. the language is a delight to listen to, can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word? samantha morton was excellent as miss smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with pride and prejudice. i liked it so much that i watched it twice in two days!! so once again thank you bbc for another quality piece of television. i have seen the paltrow version and it is okay but i do think the bbc version is far superior. an excellent production that i am very happy to own on dvd!!!",1

"regardless of what personal opinion one may have of walerian borowczyk grotesque yet beautiful gem ""la bête"" of 1975, one has to admit that this bizarre gem is an absolutely unique cinematic experience. borowczyk erotic fairy tale was banned in several countries for a long time, and it is quite obvious why this controversial gem fell victim to stuporous film censors. ""la bête"" is a fascinating blend of intense and beautiful fairy-tale-like atmosphere, quite explicit eroticism and genuine weirdness that bravely refuses to take any compromise. the fact that beastiality (of sorts) is one of the film's central themes did certainly not help it with the censors, but it made it highly controversial and therefore known to a wider audience.  pierre de l'esperance (guy tréjan), the head of a french aristocratic family, has arranged for his somewhat demented son mathurin (pierre benedetti) to marry lucy broadhurst (lisbeth hummel), the young and beautiful daughter of a wealthy english family. due to an old curse, mathurin's uncle (marcel dalió) is strictly against the wedding. when lucy and her mother arrive at the french estate, lucy immediately gets fascinated with a portrait of the 18th century ancestor romilda (sirpa lane), and with an old book depicting bizarre drawings. the story soon descends into a bizarre sexual fever-dream... without giving away too much, i can say that fans of exceptional cinema should not consider missing this film. as bizarre as it is, ""la bête"" is doubtlessly also stunningly beautiful in style, settings and cinematography. the fever-dream-like atmosphere is present within- and out of dream-sequences. the forest estate and the imposing family mansion are magnificent settings, and the beautiful score and incredible cinematography build an overwhelming atmosphere for this grotesque tale. the very explicit sexuality ranges from erotic (elegant female nudity, ravishing actresses) to seriously demented and even somewhat disgusting (close-ups on horses' genitalia while having intercourse,...); in either case it is not likely to be forgotten. the entire cast of ""la bête"" is fantastic and all involved deliver great performances in eccentric characters (some of which are seriously demented). the film profits from an exceptionally beautiful cast, be it lisbeth hummel in the lead, finnish actress sirpa lane (who sadly died of aids in 1999) as the ancestor in the dream-sequences, or the relatively unknown but particularly ravishing actress pascale rivault, who plays the aristocratic daughter who takes ever opportunity to have sex with a black servant in a cupboard.  i am intentionally not giving a full description of the most important parts of the plot as they simply have to be seen to be believed. some scenes are among the most bizarre ever caught on film, the scenes with the eponymous 'beast' definitely being among them. certainly not everybody's cup of tea, but very highly recommended to fans of controversial and unusual cinema. a true cult gem!",1
"thanks to a dull, dimensionless screenplay by neil simon, and lackluster direction from robert moore, chapter two becomes a shrill showcase for marsha mason who received her third of four oscar nods for chapter two giving the same performance here that she gave in cinnderella liberty(73), the goodbye girl(77), audrey rose(78) and only when i laugh(81);only this time she doesn't have a child to drag around. chapter two is the third and last feature film for moore having previously directed neil simon's the cheap detective(78) and murder by death(76). caan is miscast, the characters are mono-dimensional, the dialog is overly analytical, and there's virtually no establishing detail. the first half is a less-than-captivating, meet cute, coy romance between a blinkered caan and a chipper mason, and the dreary second half makes you long for the first half. the nyc locations as well as joe bologna, and a painfully thin valerie harper are irrelevant, but at least they provide some welcome distraction. and last and least, there's an awful song played during the credits.",0

"this is a badly made, poor remake of bimalda's classic parineeta. the story is based on sarat chandra's book of the same name and it is a distortion of the original. well one can appreciate some degree of creativity but not sham creativity. the acting by everyone is affected and the entire movie is a sham. shekar's father's choice of words in abusing lolita ( balan ) sounds cheap and morbid and destroys the spirit of the original story. again the scene where shekhar ( saif ) slaps lolita is quite out of place with the flow of the movie and the characters, is quite jarring to the senses, and could have been easily avoided. similarly the sex scene between saif and balan is quite unbecoming the movie and a cheap gimmick to attract the audience. when a creative work is not faithful to the original and destroys it's spirit, the work falls apart. the song ""piyu bole"" is quite ok. another silver lining in the dark cloud of this movie is the scene where saif stands up for himself and rebels against his father. this is a positive departure from the original and deserves credit. on these counts this movie deserves 3 stars. the song and dance by rekha smacks of artifice and it is a put on. the song is tuneful but i remember having heard it somewhere before and if iam not mistaken the tune appears to have been plagiarized.   well, agreed the times have changed from then to now. but then this movie is not even reflective of the modern times.  this is what happens when the modern bollywood film makers get increasingly obsessed with impressing the nris and grabbing the lucrative nri entertainment market. such movies end up neither belonging to india nor to any other part of the world.",0
"small spoilers alert !!!  good movie...very good movie. and i'm surprised to say that myself, because i'm not a big fan of vampires and the sound of the director's name deran serafian usually means bad news. most of his films are below average action movies like death warrant and gunmen. this was one of his first films and maybe he should have continued making horror movies instead of action. this movie really fascinated me. good accomplishment, seeing no famous actors or big budget was involved. it really is the story that keeps you focused. especially fans of the original dracula myth will be satisfied. sarafian lights up another aspect of the famous bram stoker story and remains rather loyal and true to the truth. it explains the life of the roemenian count dracula and how he scared the turkish army away by spearing dead corpses in front of his castle. of course, that's where the reality and the ""based on a true story"" stops. the blood drinking and stuff all was invented by bram stoker.  in this movie, the count ( vlad teppish) emigrates to the usa and seduces tons of woman. and they're all pretty girls, i'll give him that. overall, good acting by unknown faces, enough blood and gore to satisfy the more morbid horror fans and an interesting storyline. this film is really unknown and it was hidden on the darkest shelf at my local videostore. but it certainly is worth cleaning up the dust on the cover and put it in the vcr. heck, it's a lot better than the famous nicole kidman movie with the same title. these two films have nothing else in common, but i blame that movie for stealing the attention away from this nice little picture. check it out...my humble opinion on to die for = 8.5/10",1
eddie izzard is genius with his non-stop humor. i could listen all day. his unique approach to life is quite logical. his understanding of discovery (such as the heimlich maneuver) is creative. eddie izzard captures the heart of what we think. i don't know when i laughed so hard at anyone's off-beat mind.,1
"this is one of my all time favorites. it is so simple and sweet - definitely a chick flick romantic comedy. i really like a film full of good quotes and this has it... one of my favorites is when albert einstein says to ed walters ""are you thinking what i'm thinking"" and ed says ""now what are the odds of that happening!"" in my opinion, a film is fabulous if you can watch it again and again and get the same amount of enjoyment out of it, and with this one, you can!! i also really enjoyed walter m.s way of portraying einstein. i think all the characters fit together really well and the story flows nicely. there are so many times that i find myself smiling right along with the film and quoting my favorite lines as i watch it! i would recommend this movie to anyone who has a heart and enjoys a feel-good romantic comedy now and then!",1
"i only hope that no classicists/ancient historians saw ""cleopatra"", or, if they did, that they took it as a laugh. the movie is horrendously inaccurate, more laughably, even, than ""gladiator"" (which is at least a well-written script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story). most blatant is octavius, caesar's heir, in the senate before caesar's assassination: at the ripe old age of 19!  besides this, the acting is mediocre. timothy dalton has more than a hint of james bond in him when he says, ""caesar. julius caesar."" billy zane is a laughably dense marc antony. and leonor varela tries her best to be the seductive pharaoh (who in real life was not good-looking at all) but comes off as unbelievable.  so this is a warning for all historians--this movie is not true to life!",0
"throughout this film, you might think this film is just for kids. well, it is mainly pointed towards them, but it's also well-rounded enough with the jokes pointed also at the adults in the audience. this time around, the muppet gang try to get on broadway, with the dire straits keeping them from getting it produced, leading them to splitting up. but kermit won't stop, and his determination keeps things moving along until after getting the deal together he gets hit by a car and sent into amnesia!   it's a send-up, in part, of those old starring vehicles from the 40s with musicals actually as the topic of a musical, only here there's the usual lot of zaniness and wonderful moments thrown into a pot of hysterically funny moments (lou zealand's boomerang fish; gonzo's water-stunt display, the whisper campaign, among many others), but also with a lot of heart too. the muppet writers aren't shy of the conventions, on the contrary, they embrace them to the point where it's almost refreshing to see such a 'lets put on a show' story where through thick and think the characters will meet their dream.   while not as totally original in scope as the muppet movie, it's got many catchy and memorable songs, excellent locations all over manhattan, and even some intonations of inter-species dating (and marriage)! cameos include liza minneli (""a frog?""), elliot gould (as the cop), brooke shields (propositioned by a rat), edward i. koch, gregory hines and joan rivers. so get ready to sing-along, or just have a lot of big laughs and romantic (yes romantic) times with one of the best muppet movies.",1
"""envy"" is bad for a number of reasons. yes, there are unlikeable characters. that's not the problem. it is that they are unlikeable and we do not care for them at all. ""the war of the roses"" featured unlikeable characters but due to proper introductions we grew to at least find ourselves interested in their fate, whereas in ""envy"" the introduction is thin, the characters are never believable, and the plot only makes things worse.  ben stiller is simply repulsive in his role and i'm a fan of his work most of the time. stiller campaigned to have this released straight-to-video and now i can see why. the movie proposes that he's ""best friends"" with jack black, but from the first five minutes we are given footage that seems to indicate stiller hates black. i thought this would develop into some sort of one-sided relationship (a la ""the cable guy"") but it never does, instead stiller insists he's his ""best friend"" and i felt confused as he seemed to treat black like, well, ""poo."" the movie's plot is ridiculous but it doesn't matter, because it's supposed to be an exaggerated morality tale. unfortunately the message is lost in the mess. walken gives a good performance but black is off-key and annoying (and i usually find him very funny). no, it's not a horrible film but i still can't believe barry levinson (""rain man,"" ""sleepers"") is responsible for this - it's not one of the worst films of all time but it could certainly be a whole lot better. i wish va-poo-rize did exist - so we could make this film disappear forever....",0
"this movie is ridiculous. anyone saying the acting is great and the casting is superb have never seen even mediocre cinema. the acting is obviously terrible in the first 5 characters you meet. lame. i feel like all the other ""soaring"" comments must have been made by people associated with the filmmakers. i was not very impressed by the storyline, but just wanted to see some beautiful oregon countryside, and there was some decent cinematography--but the casting was anything but inspired. i think this movie also makes a mockery of the generally noble suggestion that something deep in the amerindian culture has been ignored and perhaps lost and that reviving it is worthwhile, and possible. it places jokes in the wrong and all-too-obvious places, and makes me think it was written by the state department or something. back to the drawing board. to even suggest that this film deserves a place in the same vicinity of classics like harold and maude is absolutely retarded, and along the same line of begging and pretension and ""joking"" as is rampant in this film.",0
"a suspenseful thriller that bears some resemblance to deliverance as for scenery and setting. there are also some very innovatively shot scenes and good music, although the daftness and sometimes seemingly careless attitude of one of the characters is unfitting to the situation, although this is not a mayor problem. it also poses interesting questions about justness of revenge and limits of friendship.

"while movie titles contains the word 'mother', the first thing that comes to our mind will be a mother's love for her children.  however, the mother tells a different story.  the mother do not discuss the love between a mother and her child, or how she sacrifice herself for the benefit of her child. here, notting hill director roger michell tells us how a mother's love for a man about half of her age hurts the people around her.  before daniel craig takes on the role of james bond, here, he plays darren, a man who is helping to renovate the house of the son of the mother, and sleeping with her daughter as well. anne reid, who was a familiar face on tv series, takes up the challenging role of the leading character, may.  the story begins with may coping with the sudden loss of her husband, toots, in a family visit to her son, bobby. while she befriends darren, a handyman who is doing some renovation in bobby's house, she was shocked to found out that her daughter, paula, was sleeping with darren. at the same time, may was coping with life after the death of toots. fearing that harry and paula do not wanted her, may starts to find her life going off track, until she spends her afternoon with darren.  darren was nice and friendly to may, and may soon finds some affection on darren. instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man who was about half her age with love of a couple. later, may found sexual pleasure from darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never find on anyone else. and this is the beginning of the disaster that could lead to the break down of a family.  the mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life, and solace on someone who is there for her to shoulder on. this can be told from may buying tea time snacks for darren to fulfilling sexual needs from a man younger than her, where it eventually gave her more than she bargained for.  anne reid has made a breakthrough for her role of may, as she was previously best well known for her various role on tv series. as she do not have much movies in her career resume, the mother has put her on the critic's attention. daniel craig, on the other hand, had took on a similar role in his movie career, such as sylvia (2003) and enduring love (2004). if his reprising role of james bond fails, film reviewers should not forget that he has a better performance in small productions in his years of movie career, and the mother is one of them.  the mother may not be everyone's favorite, but it is definitely not your usual matinée show to go along with tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam.",1
"this is the page for ""house of exorcism"", but most people have confused this film with the mario bava masterpiece, ""lisa & the devil"", which explains the ridiculously high rating for this, ""house of exorcism."" when ""lisa & the devil"" was shown at film festivals in the early 70's, it was a critical success. audiences responded well to that gorgeous, gothic horror film. unfortunately it was a bit ahead of it's time, and was considered too unusual, and not commercial enough for mass consumption. no distributor would buy it. so producer alfredo leone decided to edit 'lisa', seemingly with a chainsaw, by removing just about half of the original film, and adding new scenes, which he filmed two years after the original product! it is important to note that bava had little to do with these new, hideous additions, so technically ""house of exorcism"" is not a bava film. the original product is a slow, dreamy, classy production. a few minutes into the film, the viewer is jarred out of this dream world, as suddenly we see lisa, (two years older, and with a very different haircut), begin to writhe on the ground, making guttural sounds and croaking epitaphs like ""suck my co@k"", etc. subtle, huh? and the film continues like this, jumping back and forth between a beautiful, visual film, and a grade z ""exorcist"" rip-off. leone was trying to incorporate these shock scenes, while keeping some semblance of a story intact. he failed miserably. when the choice was made to basically destroy ""lisa and the devil"", bava himself refused, saying that his film was too beautiful to cut. he was right, and it must have been quite sad for this artist to see all his work destroyed and flushed down the toilet. it was many years before the original ""lisa and the devil"" was seen again, re-surfacing on late night television. i had seen ""lisa"" long before i saw this new version, and it was downright disturbing to witness one of my favorite films ""vandalised"" in this way. worth seeing only for curiosity sake. otherwise avoid this insidious disaster like the plague.",0
well i am going to go against the grain on this film so it seems. being a self confessed horror fan i sat down to this not quite knowing what to expect. after 2 or 3 mins i actually found myself scared (quite rare). the film obviously has a small budget and is set around charing cross station but the films lack of money does not distract from the story. yes the story is a bit far fetched and doesn't explain itself very well but the creep is a class act and proceeds to slash and dismember anything that comes its way. message for ladies !!! there are certain parts of the film you should close your eyes at or at least cross your legs !! you will understand when you see it.  all in all a good film and it makes a change to see a good slasher movie that actually scares,1

"watching ""ossessione"" today -- more than 6 decades later -- is still a powerful experience, especially for those interested in movie history and more specifically on how italian filmmakers changed movies forever (roughly from ""ossessione"" and de sica's ""i bambini ci guardano"", both 1943, up to 20 years later with fellini, antonioni, pasolini). visconti makes an amazing directing début, taking the (uncredited) plot of ""the postman always rings twice"" as a guide to the development of his own themes.  it strikes us even today how ahead of its time ""ossessione"" was. shot in fascist italy during world war ii (think about it!!), it depicted scenes and themes that caused the film to be immediately banned from theaters -- and the fact that it used the plot of a famous american novel and payed no copyright didn't help.   ""ossessione"" alarmingly reveals poverty-ridden war-time italy (far from the idealized italy depicted in fascist ""telefoni bianchi"" movies); but it's also extremely daring in its sexual frankness, with shirtless hunk gino (massimo girotti, who definitely precedes brando's kowalski in ""a streetcar named desire"") taking giovanna (clara calamai), a married woman, to bed just 5 minutes after they first meet. we watch calamai's unglamorous, matter-of-fact undressing and the subtle but undeniable homosexual hints between gino and lo spagnolo (elio marcuzzo - a very appealing actor, his face not unlike pierre clémenti's, who was shot by the nazis in 1945, at 28 years old!)...in a few words: sex, lust, greed and poverty, as relentlessly as it had rarely, if ever, been shown before in italian cinema.  all the copies of ""ossessione"" were destroyed soon after its opening -- it was called scandalous and immoral. visconti managed to save a print, and when the film was re-released after the war, most critics called it the front-runner of the neo-realist movement, preceding rossellini's ""roma città aperta"" and de sica's ""sciuscià"". some other critics, perhaps more appropriately, saw ""ossessione"" as the italian counterpart to the ""poetic realism"" of french cinema (remember visconti had been renoir's assistant), especially marcel carné's ""quai des brumes"" and ""le jour se lève"", and julien duvivier's ""pépé le moko"".   while ""ossessione"" may be neo-realistic in its visual language (the depiction of war-time paesan life in italy with its popular fairs, poverty, child labor, prostitution, bums, swindlers etc), the characters and the themes were already decidedly viscontian. he was always more interested in tragic, passionate, obsessive, greedy characters, in social/political/sexual apartheid, in the decadence of the elites than in realistic, ""everyday- life"" characters and themes, favored by desica and rossellini. in ""ossessione"" we already find elements of drama and tragedy later developed in many of his films, especially ""senso"" (visconti's definitive departure from neo-realist aesthetics) and ""rocco e suoi fratelli""...even in his most ""neo-realist"" film, ""la terra trema"", he makes his fishermen rise from day-to-day characters to mythological figures.  ""ossessione"" is a good opportunity to confirm the theory about great artists whose body of work approaches, analyzes and develops specific themes and concerns over and over again, from their first to their last opus, no matter if the scenery, background or time-setting may change -- visconti may play with the frame but the themes and essence of his art are, well, obsessively recurrent. ""ossessione"" is not to be missed: you'll surely be fascinated by this ground-breaking, powerful film.",1

"i remember seeing this film when it first came out in 1982 & loved it then. about 4 years later i had the privilege of seeing luciano pavarotti sing at the metropolitan opera house in new york (in tosca) so seeing the ending of this film reminds me very much of that great night. what's not to like about this film? the music is brilliant and pavarotti (fini) was at his best and still looked great. the story is actually very funny in parts & the 'food fight' scene is still one of the funniest i have ever seen. the hot air balloon flight over the napa valley was beautiful & so was the song he sang ""if we were in love"" (one of the few times pavarotti sang in english). and hearing the duet of santa lucia gorgeous. get real folks, this was a film about an opera singer called georgio fini who just happened to be played by pavarotti. kathryn harrold & eddie albert were excellent in their supporting roles.  i am very glad that i still have this almost worn out vhs tape of this movie but i would love this to be released on dvd especially now that pavarotti is no longer with us because i think this includes the best performance of nessun dorma sung by him still on film today!",1
"this movie is about tyrannus, a gladiator who is brought back from the dead to summon tyrannus, a gladiator who must be brought back from the dead. tyrannus, we learn after about an hour, is also called demonicus. this adds much needed depth to the screenplay and calls into question our assumptions about identity, psychology and ourselves.   the spirit of tyrannus accomplishes his little to-do list (killing some people and saying repetitive phrases in latin) by possessing the body of a college guy. he uses a magic mind-control helmet to do this, which the college boy willingly puts on his head, and then at several points in the movie, takes off and puts back on.  maria performs oral sex on a poor man's sean willian scott, and tyrannus wears the rollerball glove. tyrannus has his own green backlighting for no reason, and has apparently been sitting next to cg fire in an ancient concrete tunnel for centuries like this. utter misfortune.  this movie is empty and will hurt you. see it.",0

"beginning with its long opening shot of seemingly endless rows of assembly line workers in a chinese factory, manufactured landscapes attempts to show the devastating impact of industrialization on the natural environment and traditional societies. its droning narrative assumes that industrial development in china and elsewhere is entirely unprecedented, as if there had never been an industrial revolution in europe and america and karl marx had never visited the british museum. that there might be a connection between the present-day asian drive for industrialization and wealth and earlier experiences of starvation and terror is never mentioned.  at the same time, there's an effort to present edward burtynsky's photographs of industrial waste as somehow ""beautiful"". much of the film is a slide show of these images. they are well produced, of museum size, and have apparently appeared in several exhibitions. to me, however, they only demonstrate that almost any photograph can be made to appear beautiful if well presented. industrial waste is still industrial waste. the relationship, if any, between the photographs and the film's spoken message remains unclear.  i don't mean to imply that there aren't real and sometimes desperate problems when countries rush to industrialize. manufactured landscapes, however, offers only strange and bitter hopelessness. it's like a two-hour lecture by noam chomsky. maybe it has some value as a demonstration of what's wrong with the american (and canadian) left.",0

"like with any movie genre, there are good gangster movies and there are bad gangster movies. if you asked me to name a good gangster movie, i'd have dozens to choose from. if you asked me to name a bad gangster movie, probably the first one to pop up in my mind is one that still has me in a sort of depression of disappointment about a week since i saw the film for the first and i promise you, the last time. that film is ""the general"", unrelated to the 1926 silent film of the same name. this is a very dry, very slow gangster epic that raises questions not about the story (it's more than easy to follow) but about why the filmmakers chose to make this rather flimsy endeavor.  like ""goodfellas"" (1990) and ""american gangster"" (2007)two superior mob movies""the general"" is based on real people and true events. the film revolves around an irish criminal named martin cahill (brendan gleeson) who started his long chain of crimes stealing food as a teenager and then moving up to robbing museums and houses as an adult. meanwhile, the police led by an inspector named kenny (jon voight) try desperately and vigorously to prove just one of his crimes and convict (or kill) him.  perhaps because it's a film in the same category as the marvelous ""goodfellas"" (1990) and the first two ""godfather"" films, i was expecting too much from ""the general."" but that may be going too easy on it. this would have been a bad film had i not seen the aforementioned masterpieces before being swamped by boredom in this oater and its far-too-stretched running time of screaming bad scenes. let's start knocking the film by just looking at the style in which it is presented. for some reason, director john boorman and cinematographer seamus deasy selected to film this movie in black-and-white while its style and presentation are clearly the elements that belong to a full-fledged color film. now i have nothing against b/w pictures, not even ones made in modern-day times. ""schindler's list"" (1993) was more than ninety percent filmed in black-and-white and it's a masterpiece. ""the general"", made just five years after ""schindler's list"" is not. the cinematography is also far too blown out with high lighting keys that seem very distracting and give the movie a very video-game-like quality that i found simply annoying. the filmmakers were obviously going for a realist's documentary-like style, like ""schindler's list"" did, but they fail by making it seem too much like a documentary and at the same time, too much like a classic-style motion picture. performances in the film range from passable to poor. brendan gleeson and jon voight gave decent enthusiasm for their roles, but it seemed to me at times that even they were getting kind of run down by the awful screenplay from which they were quoting. the sound design is also very primitive, probably in an attempt to give it a 40s crime-noir appeal, but that also fails because again, it's made too much like a contemporary picture and seems vastly out of place.  but the worst thing that occurs is that there's not onenot onecharacter in the film that i felt any emotions or opinions for. in fact, for every moment of every scene, the only thought going through my head was ""okayso what?"" moments that in a better film might come across as shocking or appalling are just dull and time-consuming here. i did not sympathize or hate the brendan gleeson character because the way the cahill character is written is simply flat and dull. gleeson just plays the common criminal and does not strike out with the impact the real martin cahill obviously did. if a character is killed off (as they always are in gangster films), we feel nothing. no remorse, no relief, no surprise, nothing. we just say ""so what?"" and that's all i did during the entire running time of this very flimsy, very poorly-made crime film.",0
"i love sabrina! its one of my fave shows!! my favourite episodes are; the one where she turns libby into a geek, the first episode, the true love episode and most of the rest from the first series. i do think the college episodes were not as good as the high school ones but they were better than the last series which was awful. valerie was a good character as she was more rounded than jenny, but jenny was in some brilliant episodes. hilda and zelda were amazing, and there seemed to be no explanation for where they went! libby was a good character too. i never liked morgan or roxy, they just weren't as good as her other friends.",1

"jane austen's emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best i have ever seen. kake beckinsale's emma is irreproachable. gwyneth paltrow, (with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography) is able to bring out the comedy effectively, she fails to make emma likeable. paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply 'wrong' for the part (and i believe the era) and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses. kate beckinsale, on the other hand, manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what mr knightly (the most romantic of jane austen's heroes) actually sees in her. mark strong is a splendid mr knightly with the right mix of handsome looks, an appropriate age, chivalry, compassion and gentlemanly behaviour. emma and mr knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful.",1

"when sam peckinpah's superlative the wild bunch (1969) opened the door to outrageous displays of graphic cinematic ultra-violence, it did so with a talented (if whisky-marinated) hand guiding the camera and had a compelling story with characters who had actual depth, but in no time flat there were scores of imitators that fell far from the benchmark set by peckinpah's epic, and soldier blue definitely falls into that category.  soldier blew, er, blue tells the story of foul-mouthed new yorker cresta lee (candice bergen) a blonde proto-hippie chick who's been ""rescued"" from two years of ""captivity"" among the cheyenne and is now being sent to a fort where she'll be reunited with the fiancée she only wants to marry for his money. also on board the wagon she's traveling in is a shipment of government gold, cash the cheyenne need to buy guns with, so in short order the soldiers are wiped out and cresta flees to the hills, accompanied by honus gant (peter strauss), the lone surviving cavalryman. calling gant by the snarky nickname ""soldier blue,"" cresta demonstrates that her years among the ""savages"" was time well spent, outstripping gant in survival skills, common sense, and sheer balls, and over their journey toward the fort they must persevere against the elements, a band of hostile kiowa, an unscrupulous trader  played by donald pleasance, here giving one of his most ridiculous performances, and that's saying something  and, in the tradition of many previous western-set romantic comedies, each other.  during the course of their misadventures the two opposites are inevitably  and predictably  attracted to each other and eventually end up getting it on  while gant has a freshly- treated bullet wound that went clean through his leg, no less  in what was surely the only conveniently located cave for at least a twelve mile radius that wasn't filled with rattlesnakes, mountain lions, or who knows what, to say nothing of the cheyenne, who could have done something really spiffy with such a primo apartment (there i go, thinking in nyc real estate terms again).   realizing that their love could never flourish outside of the cave, cresta leaves gant and makes it to the fort by herself only to discover that the moron in charge won't spare a couple of men so they can rescue gant; the regiment needs all available personnel to launch an attack on the nearby cheyenne village, and once cresta gets wind of that she slips past her obnoxiously horny hubby-to-be and makes a beeline straight to the cheyenne to warn them of what's coming.   what happens next is what gained the film its infamy; it turns out that all the wacky misadventures and squabbling were all just a lead-in to a hideous reenactment of the 1864 sand creek massacre, an orgy of rape, torture and general sadistic evil perpetrated in the name of ""keeping the country clean,"" and almost forty years after its release this sequence still disturbs and nauseates for its sheer cruelty. children are trampled beneath the hooves of charging horses or impaled on bayonets, unarmed people are beheaded  a nice effect, i have to admit  women are stripped and pawed by gangs of slavering brutes, then raped and mutilated  in one truly sickening instance a naked native woman puts up too much of a fight, so her rapist instead decides to cut off her breasts, which we thankfully only see the start of before the camera moves on to chronicle some other hideous act  and scores of innocent people are shot and dismembered, their compone nt parts impaled on pikes and waved about in victorious celebration or kept as the most ghoulish of souvenirs. no joke, this scene would instantly garner an nc-17 rating if released today, to say nothing of possibly spurring native american interest groups to riot in the streets over the incredibly exploitative manner in which the atrocities are depicted.  i'm all in favor of westerns that don't shy away from honest portrayals of how the west was won, or stolen if truth be told, but this film has no idea of what kind of movie it wants to be; one minute it's a heavy-handed pseudo-hippy lecture about how the treatment of the natives was totally effed up (well, duh!), then it's a light-hearted battle of the sexes farce wherein cresta proves herself five times the man gant is and manages to look hot in her tasty red calico poncho (with no undies), but that all goes out the window when donald pleasance shows up with an unintentionally (?) hilarious pair of buck-toothed dentures and our heroes must figure out how to escape from his murderous clutches in a sub-plot that goes nowhere, all of which culminates in the aforementioned apocalyptic climax. any one of those tacks would have been okay for a coherent film, but the end result is a slapdash mess that milked the horrors of its final ten minutes for all they were worth in the film's promotion and poster imagery.   but by trying to be all things to all audiences, soldier blue ends up as an incoherent, preachy mulligan stew of presumably well-intentioned political correctness, but if they were going to tell the story of the sand creek massacre, wouldn't it have been a good idea to have some indian characters who were more than just walk-ons with murphy brown acting as their mouthpiece? we get to know absolutely nothing of the people who get wiped out solely for what appears to be a crass ploy to lure gorehound moviegoers into seeing ""the most savage film in history."" if you, like me, were intrigued by the provocative ads and reviews that shower almost endless praise upon it for its ""daring to tell it like it was,"" take my word for it and let soldier blue slowly fade into cinematic obscurity.",0
"this docu-drama is what you would expect from richard attenborough, the man who gave us ""gandhi"": beautifully photographed, compellingly casted, well written in the measured, literate manner that hollywood discarded in the 30's, and scrupulously accurate. it stands out as a genre film, excelling in its portrayal of native american (or, more appropriately for its canadian setting, ""first nations"") culture and standing with ""black robe"" as a wonderfully photographed piece of canoe country and its culture (here, circa 1934). this idyllic portrait derives drama from its subject: archie ""grey owl"" belaney, a scot raised in hastings (england) by maiden aunts who became so obsessed with the ""red indian"" tales of his childhood that he went to canada, disappeared into the woods, and became a trapper and adopted son of an ojibway band. he was a vain man with a habit of marrying and abandoning  indian brides, none of whom seem to have thought less of him for it, for he was also an extraordinarily charming and picaresque character. one of his wives (one smarter than he, by most accounts) propelled him into fame as a writer and early advocate for protecting the wild country of the north, and this forms the focus of attenborough's tale. the chemistry between brosnan and annie galipeau (as grey owl's wife pony) is engaging and, if not firey, is nonetheless quite touching. a good film when you need some time from the madding crowd.",1
"a very bad attempt at a young spinal tap. at least the music in spinal tap was good.  this is really a very sad case of hollywood nepotism at it's worst. a bunch of hollywood execs, bad musicians and producers create some ""poopie"" show so their kids can be in the spotlight. oh please!!! the potty humor was even bad. i hate this stuff when there is really incredibly talented kids (musicians, actors and artists) out there busting their butts to have success and this crap comes along.  help u all!!!! why wasn't gene simmons in it??? ameriac's taste in entertainment is going down the toilet.",0
"streisand fans only familiar with her work from the funny girl film onwards need to see this show to see what a brilliant performer streisand was - before she achieved her goal of becoming a movie star. there had never been a female singer quite like her ever before, and there never would be again (sorry, celine - only in your dreams!), but never again would streisand sing with the vibrancy, energy, and, above all, the enthusiasm and vulnerability with which she performs here - by the time she gets to that central park concert only 2 or 3 years later, she'd been filming funny girl in hollywood and her performing style has become less spontaneous and more reserved, more rehearsed (and, let's face it: more angry) - there's a wall between her and the audience. live performing was never what she really enjoyed - she did it because she knew it was her ticket to hollywood, and once she no longer had to do it she's done it as little as possible (and oh, that legendary stage fright provides such a good excuse!).  her vocals here and on her earlier judy garland show appearance are incredible: streisand could truly make an old song sound new again, and composers such as richard rodgers and harold arlen loved her for it. but by the 1970s streisand was trying to be a ""rock"" singer, her albums pandering to the younger audiences, with over-wrought shrieking of songs that were unworthy of her effort or her voice.   in the '80s she came back with that brilliant ""broadway album,"" but went on and on about what a struggle it was to get it done, how ""they"" told her not to do it, etc. oh please - when has anyone told streisand what to do? she could have been doing good stuff like that all along, bringing audiences up to her level instead of stooping to what she thought the young public wanted. (the ""back to broadway"" sequel wasn't nearly as good, as streisand seems to feel it necessary to improve on other composers' work: if he were alive at the time, would richard rodgers have even recognized his own ""some enchanted evening""? rodgers, notorious for taking singers to task for playing around with his melodies, would undoubtedly have been after streisand to sing what he'd written! she also blows michael crawford off the cd in their duet of ""music of the night"" - apparently reminding him just whose cd this is. why does she insist on taking songs that are duets and singing them by herself, and songs that aren't duets and singing them as duets with someone else who she then goes on to diminish?)  supposedly judy garland took streisand aside and advised her, ""don't let them do to you what they did to me,"" advice streisand wasted no time in heeding - despite her protestations to the contrary, surely it looks like it's always been her way or the highway. just imagine - she told the cbs brass how her first tv special would be done - no guests, just her.  but nobody can argue with the results that are so evident here. treat yourself to this brilliant musical phenomenon before she was a legend - you'll be absolutely amazed at the difference!  ps - i watched this again last night (12/01) after not having seen it for many years - it was even better than i remembered! the 1st act begins with ""i'm late"" and includes ""make believe"" and ""how does the wine taste,"" and barbra's homage to childhood, ""i'm five"" - it climaxes as streisand appears with full (and i mean full) orchestra to sing ""people"" - she wasn't bored with the song yet and although it's a somewhat shorter rendition it really soars - compare it to some of her later ""auto-pilot"" versions. the 2nd act (after streisand's ""kooky"" schtick-patter, which hasn't changed much over the years) is the famous series of depression songs set amidst the extravagance of bergdorf-goodman's.  the 3rd act is the stunner - call it ""streisand, the orchestra, and the audience"" (although we never see the audience that supposedly witness this historic event). with her fear of audiences and dislike of such performing, this may have been the toughest part for her, but if so, to her credit it doesn't show. she tears through ""lover come back to me"" and the torchy ""when the sun comes out"" (though i can't remember in which order!), the poignant ""why did i choose you? (one of my all-time favorite streisand performances) and offers a medley of funny girl songs, including (of course) ""don't rain on my parade"" and my favorite song from the score, ""the music that makes me dance"". explaining that ""fanny brice sang a song like that in 1922, and it made her the toast of broadway"", streisand then sings ""my man"", and it's almost a dress-rehearsal template for her later screen rendition in the funny girl film (the main difference being that the black gown here is sleeveless - her film gown had long sleeves and against the black background all we saw were her hands and face), but the vocal here is more urgent and charged than her later film vocal. (her performance of the song has everything to do with streisand and nothing to do with fanny brice who, of course, never sang the song in such an all-out manner as streisand does here or in the film - see the great ziegfield for a glimpse of brice's more understated version.) the show ends with streisand singing ""happy days are here again"" over the credits.  when it was over i said to the friend i was watching it with, ""she has never, ever, done anything better!""  and she was twenty-three years old!",1
"robert a. heinlein's classic novel starship troopers has been messed around with in recent years, in everything to paul verhoeven's 1997 film to a tv series, to a number of games. but none of these, so to speak, has really captured the spirit of his novel. the games are usually unrelated, the tv series was more of a spin off, and the less said about verhoeven's film, the better. little do most know, however, that in japan, an animated adaptation had already been done, released the year of heinlein's death. and, believe it or not, despite its differences, this 6-part animated series is, plot-wise, the most faithful adaptation of heinlein's classic.  the most obvious plus to this series is the presence of the powered armor exoskeletons, something we were deprived of in verhoeven's film. like the book, the series focuses more on the characters and their relationships than on action and space travel, though we see a fair amount of each. while events happen differently than in the book, the feel of the book's plot is present. rico and carmen have a romantic entanglement, but it's only slightly more touched upon than in the book. while some may believe the dialogue and character interaction to be a bit inferior to the book (it gets a bit of the anime treatment, but what did you expect?), but it's far superior to the film. heinlein's political views are merely excised, as opposed to the film, where they are reversed. the big payoff of the series, however, is the climatic battle on klendathu between the troopers and the bugs/aliens, which features the kind of action from the powered armor suits we would have like to have seen in a film version.  overall, i enjoyed this series because i wanted to see a vision closer to that of heinlein. and i think they did pretty well with this. if you can find this series, give it a look.",1
"they played this on the july 4th twilight zone marathon and this is, hands down, the worst twilight zone episode i've ever seen. it's completely out of sync with the rest of the series in its tone. even though twilight zone is a pretty uneven series and many episodes end up being groaningly predictable, this one was completely out of place. compare this to legendary episodes like ""a stop at willoughby"" or ""midnight sun"", and you realize there is no comparison.  buster keaton did what he could with such terrible material, and frankly it surprises me that someone of his historic comedy stature would stoop to the level of this episode. even though he seemed to be giving it some effort, he must have needed the money... there's no other explanation.",0
"yes, mtv there really is a way to market daria. what started as a clever teenage angst-""comment on everything that sucks and make the viewer feel better about their sucky teenage life"" sitcom now mutated into a ""how you should deal with your problems""-charade. i used to watch daria all the time and loved it. now, sitting here after watching the so called ""movie"" i can only wonder what the point of this all was. daria tells us how to lead out life in college? excuse me? didn't the point daria made every episode that what you like to do is ok, as long as it is ok with yourself no matter what the rest of the sick sad world thinks of it? this entire thing reminded me of the scene in ""reality bites"" the movie channel shows the documentry for the first time.",0
"i think ""anyway..."" is a kick-ass movie. really. tom barman spent like years making it, and it shows: every scene is polished, has a meaning,... i guess most agree on that. one thing many people tend to criticize is the ""lack"" of story. i'm afraid that that's an effect of us being overwhelmed with ""traditional"" storytelling, all the time. i mean: what you can achieve with a book, you can't achieve with a movie, what you can achieve with a movie, you cannot achieve it by just telling it to a buddy. the problem is that we're so used to movies, series,... to be just a filmed version of a story; a visual recording of events -just like when you watch the news- that we expect every movie to have this epic characteristics: a strong storyline with a lot of unusual events. and i stress the idea of ""unusual events"": most people see on tv in the news, in movies, series,... very unusual things, once-in-a-lifetime situations. and here, in ""anyway..."", there are unusual events, but not in the same ""hollywood big explosion"" kind of way: guy gets fired, couple back together, car gets stolen... and of course very usual things. and that's strong: just being able to appreciate all of that, that universe, that's art. and i agree that especially what can only be achieved in movies, that atmosphere created by the score and the photography is put central. but not like in traditional visual movies (visual blockbusters such as the matrix); it serves the characters and remains deeply human. i mean, in every shot you feel the love that tom barman has for antwerp and urban lifestyle. and he has no point with this movie, like to ""learn"" us something; and he has no big story to tell with incredible scenario twists. he just shows everyday people with everyday lives, he shows a city, all with their good and bad sides and says: this is us, that's our city, that's life, let's enjoy it. so basically, ""anyway..."" is not only that super groovy movie, it also has a much stronger ""message"" (it's not explicit, maybe even not intended) than most movies how really intend to pass a message. one drawback: now, we'll have to wait five years to see the next barman pic, and everyone will expect so much of it...",1
"well, i must say that this was one hell of a fun movie. despite the fact that the dubbing was pretty cheesy, and there were some odd moments where the film seemed to turn dark blue for no apparent reason, i was not disappointed. the story was actually pretty interesting: the last member of the poison clan must track down the other five members and discover who among them is using their skills for evil, and who is using them for good. the catch being that during training, all of the clan were masked, and all have since returned to society in disguise and changed their names.  the fights are a joy to watch, as each member of the poison clan has a different fighting style: toad (my favorite), snake, scorpion, lizard, and centipede. the fight scenes have the actors jumping all over the place, and thankfully the camera stays planted and uses a wide enough shot so you can clearly see all of the action.  the one drawback to the movie is that the story tends to drag a bit in the first half up until the first fight sequence. but stick with it, and you won't be disappointed!",1

"in the sequel to the brilliant bill and ted's excellent adventure, bill and ted are under threat from the future, as the evil chuck de nomolos sends two evil robots, disguised as bill and ted to earth to kill human bill and ted, in order to change the future.  in a great comedy pairing, winter and reeves excel to deliver delicious humour to the audience in this entertaining sequel. though lacking the sharpness of the first, bogus journey still has the great catchphrases and dialogue from the leading pair, not to mention an hilarious performance by william sadler, who brings a humorous side to the figure of depth, the grim reaper. watch for the games sequences, the best moment in the entire film, but one of many great techniques used to justify the genre.  though still packed with humour, this film has a more dramatic film towards it, with stakes being more serious and situations more risky.   this gives the film great dimension and another lovable feature. the creators also stretch the boundaries of the fantasy genre and the use of realism, with hell and heaven being heavily symbolic and present in the plot. the fantasy genre is again spot on with the use of that amazing time travelling machine, though again somewhat confusing at points with the use of timing, and objects and situations being placed before it happens in the present, as is evident in the final couple of scenes.  the first watch i hated this sequel, but the second time was a real joy as i appreciated the jokes and story more, and though the jokes and plot aren't as strong as its predecessor, bogus journey has enough feel good motives, jokes and a fairly steady plot to make it a good natured family film.",1
"i like a lot of the actors/actresses involved in this project so being insulted by the movie felt even worse than if they used a unknowns .the main problem was this movie was clearly just a concept created to appeal to baby boomers .in 20 or 30 years nbc will probably do a movie just like this about the early 90's . i can see it now a black family where the kids are involved with the la riot's and the white family has the kids rebel and listen to grunge rock music .the soundtrack will feature bands like nirvana , n.w.a , public enemy , soundgarden etc .the movie like this will be just as cheesy as the 60's and i gurantee you nbc will do it .see the biggest problem with period pieces when done buy networks is that when you are living in a certain time period you aren't thinking i am living in the 60's or whatever decade is trendy retro at the time .next time someone does something like this they should put more weight into there project",0

"in my knowledge, largo winch was a famous belgium comics (never read) telling the adventures of a playboy, a sort of james bond without the spy life! so, when i had to choose a movie for a 5 years-old kid, i picked it up because the kid was already a great fan of james bond!  but, just after the opening credits, i got heavy doubts: when american movies offer amazing start, here, no action and a torrid sex scene  then, the story get very complicated with financial moves i thought i lost the kid.  but, strangely, he had been caught by largo, and more than james bond!   was it the excellent interpretation of tomer sisley? the difficult relationship largo has with his father? the multiple box story in which the friends are the bad guys, the bad guys are the friends? the exotic locations of honk-kong, yougoslavia?   dunno, but he really cares about largo (""will he get up?) and we enjoyed our moment.",0
"i had a heck of a good time viewing this picture, and was splendidly surprised at its more erudite features. first off, the film is undeniably cheaply-made with its cardboard sets, limited settings, and creative scientific props. the acting ranges from very poor(the two strippers), barely professional(herb evers as the leading man), gothic overstatement(leslie daniels as the assistant kurt)to first-rate with virginia leith in the title role as the headless victim alive against her will for the benefit of science and her fiancee's lustful passions. the scripting though is very good and the dialogue is fantastic for a movie of this ilk. issues abound about what role science and medicine have in our lives and what their boundaries should be. this film is a thinking film in many ways. however, don't be too fooled by its real intent. it is a sleazy story about a man obsessed with his aptitude in medical science who wishes to fuse together his dead girlfriend's head with the perfect body, thereby creating the perfect woman for a man with the best of both body and soul. one other very bright aspect of the film is the sax music which resonates strongly every time the doctor scours town for female beauties.",1
"very disappointing film. by the end i no longer cared for any of the characters. i did enjoy seeing ving rhames in a very small part, and william macy was good as always, still not worth watching. it starts out strong and just keeps getting weaker and weaker. insomniacs will like it as i am sure it will put them to sleep.",0
"i've read a few of the reviews and i'm kinda sad that a lot of the story seems glossed over. its easy to do because its not a book, its a movie and there's only so much that can be done in a movie- us or canadian- or anywhere.  colm feore does, at least for a recovering ""f@g-hag"" like myself, a great job of not only playing the 'friendly neighborhood' gay man- but playing sick. i mean, the man really can't get much more pale! though, you might never know it from the strip down near the... um, end.  if you need decrepit, there are a few sking movies you might like.  being the daughter of a recovering alchoholic, the druggie brother {david cubitt} was the trick for me. i'm going to give him cred, he grew up quick- and believe me that's good. and, as an aspiring writer, moimeme, i can dig a lot of his insights and overviews. but i'm more prosy than poetic.  i may be easy to please, but i enjoyed it. a nice story pretty well put together- by canadians, quelle surprise. just toed the line of the 'movie of the week,' missing it by not being as drawn out, greatly appreciated. and it was rather cleverly portrayed.",1
"who doesn't know largo winch in the france-belgium-luxemburg trio (the three countries where the french ""bd"" or ""bandes dessinées"" are massively published) ? 18 years after the publication of the first comic book, which is itself an adaptation of a series of novels, it had to be adapted on screens. after a first - and failed- attempt with a tv show, the real thing begins.  first of all, and that's what most of the fans didn't get, the goal of this movie is not strictly to adapt the comic book series. some essential parts, characters and actions of the original are missing. the movie itself offers an alternative and more modern version of the series. as a 1st class-fan of the comic book, i must confess i was nicely surprised. the actors are good, so is the scenario, though it might seem too fast. i thus recommend this movie to all those interested by financial/political thrillers, but it is clearly not an alternative to james bond or jason bourne series as i could read over the internet.",1
"there is no greater disservice to do to history than to misrepresent it. this takes the easiest and most shallow route, simply portraying him as a monster. only showing his negative sides, and exaggerating them. ""those who are ignorant of the past doom us to repeat it"". he was a human being. that may prove tough to some people to accept, but an important part of life is facing that which we don't want to. rather than demonizing the man, we ought to try to understand him. otherwise, we stand little chance of preventing anyone similar in the future, or possibly even the present, from succeeding at anything of remotely comparable scope, as far as damage and misery goes. hate him and what he did, don't make him into something mythical, intentionally or otherwise. frankly, far too much of this mini-series could play ""dumb dumb *duuum*!"" after or during scenes. the whole thing nods, nudges and winks at the audience, with a clear message of ""was this guy evil or what"", incorporating every single bad trait(as well as making up several that go directly against who and what he was), letting them appear more or less out of nowhere, and having them be constant throughout his life, not something he came to believe or claimed to. this should never be used to educate. use der untergang(downfall, in english), and maybe point out the few inaccuracies of that, instead. this, this is disrespectful to the actual events that took place, and to any and all survivors, not to mention those who died. the cinematic quality? top-notch. it's well-done, through and through, excellent production values, a solid arc to the well-told plot, what characterization does occur is strong and credible, dialog and script are great, all acting performances are masterful(carlyle looks and behaves the role... as it was written... perfectly), the music is well-composed, cinematography and editing are flawless and creative, and this is definitely dramatic, entertaining and riveting. they get dates and many occurrences, and do them justice. if i had been offered to work on this, and did not feel i could be objective enough to have hitler appear as a fully fleshed-out person, i would have declined, citing that as the reason. i don't blame anyone for loathing him. how can you forgive what he did, and are we sure that we should? that is not what i am suggesting. finally, let me point out that, as i write this, we are in a world-wide economic crisis that has lasted for about two years, and that is not terribly dissimilar to the stock market crash of 1929. the two reasons it hasn't led to a depression of the new millennium are as follows: governments are giving money to the banks to keep the market going, and the majority of the countries is now friendly towards one another. apart from that, the lesson hadn't been learned. hopefully, it has now. back to this... my suggestion? read a book, non-fiction, dealing with the subject. there are plenty of informative, smart ones. the dvd holds a trailer. i recommend this only to those who know better, and vehemently urge anyone who has watched it, to seek out the truth. 8/10",1

"this movie start quite gruesomely with a female being bound and psychologically tortured. there's male full frontal nudity, dead animal parts, dogs licking nipples, the female loosing control of her bladder. all shot in a gray cold color. effective, but a little too much. we then move on to seeing the btk killer's youth as well as the present and his history of crimes. the tension is entirely psychological and the scenes of the killer entering the homes of his victims and talking to them lasts for quite a long time and it's creepy. here we don't see fancy or good imagery, it looks as if shot with your home camera. it doesn't look horrifying, but in a way seeing a criminal engage his victims for quite some time before killing them is quite unusual and chilling. what this movie doesn't have is any drama, really. there are some cop scenes every once in a while, but there's no excitement in terms of them finding the killer. there isn't much of an arc to this story. this could have been an effective psychological thriller, a study of madness. unfortunately, the movie is filled with real slaughterhouse footage. it's dispersed throughout the movie and comes on suddenly again and again. sometimes you don't know it's coming and don't have enough time to look away. and that i have to reject. i'm all for low budget horror movies but i don't tolerate animal suffering. it was unnecessary, excessive, and comes without warning. i'm glad that lionsgate releases stuff that no one else does, but they should have passed on this movie or edited out the animal gore. stay away from this garbage.",0

"peter weir's first international success, the last wave is a mainly effective chiller with a fascinating back story based on aboriginal myth. richard chamberlain gives a good performance as a defense lawyer whose life becomes increasingly unmoored from reality as he delves deeper into a murder case involving aboriginal tribal rivalries. david gulpilil plays one of the suspects, who does his best to guide chamberlin thru the realm of 'dreamtime', an alternate reality/timeline central to native australian history and tribal custom. heavy on atmosphere, deliberately ambiguous in plotting, the film builds to an unsettling finale which is somewhat diminished by poor effects, probably due to budgetary limitations. nevertheless an intriguing film whose overall impression of mystery and dread lurking just below the surface of what we perceive as 'reality' will stay with you.",1

"this three stooges flick is at a tie with my other favorite flick ""disorder in the court"". this is an uproar of laughter for any three stooges fan to enjoy.  the boys are janitors at a recording studio when they hear the lovely christine mcintyre sings a great version of ""voices of spring"". she is going to be offered a record deal, but she is scarred to be honest with her father about her choice of a career and prove herself as a real singer. when she and the others leave the studio, the stooges decide to have a little fun and play her record and dress curly up as christine. the contract lady who can make christine's career, sees curly and mistakes him for christine and invites curly to sing for her party. of course there is a man that they have upset that is at the party and they destroy his solo in front of the crowd, so he'll find a way to get back at them.  what a great stooge flick, this should not be missed!   10/10",1
"wow, this movie was absolutely brilliant. i really don't know why everyone says it has a slow pace. i thought the pace was perfect. the movie is about michael sullivan played by tom hanks with perfection who is a sort of hit-man/ killer working for john rooney (paul newman). he disslikes this job but does it because rooney payed for his house and helps him financially. he had nothing and mr. rooney gave him everything. but, his children are unaware that this is his job, and when one witnesses a cold blooded murder by him, he is placed in an awkward position. and when an atrocity occurs, he leaves with his son and is bent on revenge. they rob abanks and much more and build a bond. they're the perfect team. hanks does a great job as always as well as jude law who plays his creepy role to perfection. this drama is highly recommended as it shows a beautiful story and greatly shows how the 1930s were.",1
"this- and not a certain slightly overrated southern soap opera-was the greatest epic to come out of hollywoods greatest year, 1939.i will not not restate the obvious-cary grant,victor mclaglen( who was a bengal lancer), and douglas fairbanks jr. give superb comic performances.however, i want to note two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. the magnificent final battle sequence, as the wonderful sam jaffe climbs laboriously up to the pinnacle of the temple to blow his bugle and warn the regiment, is simply grand. it never fails to enthrall me. yet another underrated element in the film is eduardo ciannelli's performance as the guru. this is no fu manchu caricature, but an well drawn, articulate, historically informed ( ""have you ever heard of changruputra maurya?he defeated the armies left in india by alexander the great"")villain. indeed, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well known figure of the thirties( a german, not an indian). gunga din, anti-nazi tract? not quite. but still, a tremendous, funny, moving epic.",1
"flat characters that you do not and never will care about. cringe-inducing dialogue at places. no twists (they think they have one, but if you didn't figure it out after about 40mins you're not too bright). lots of well know actors in roles and performances that, fortunately for everyone involved, will be forgotten as soon as the end credits roll.  i don't mind 'slow' movies, but they've got to be going _somewhere_. this one doesn't.  the plot wasn't what made this a direct-to-dvd movie, that's just a rather convenient excuse to try and drum up some fake controversy.  the as-of-writing 37(!) ten (10) ratings must be from people involved with the production.",0

"i give this movie an a+ for the sheer camp of it! as dietrich's daughter maria riva wrote in the book on her mother, ""if one sees the garden of allah in the context of high camp, it can be very amusing."" and how! i laughed with delight at the overwrought score and the astoundingly, ridiculously, fantastically melodramatic dialogue. viewers who've read the accounts of boyer's toupee (it kept coming unstuck in the heat) will snicker every time it makes an appearance.  dietrich and boyer rarely look at each other when giving their lines -- instead they gaze dreamily off into the distance, presumably so their faces can be photographed at the best angle and with the most advantageous light (if you're starring in a turkey might as well look good!). dietrich's costumes are out of this world. as riva notes in her book, dietrich managed to steal paramount's travis banton and have him design some of the most divine gowns, such as the chiffon beige dress & cape.  i heartily agree with the other reviewers who rave about the technicolor. it really is hard to believe the film was done in 1936 -- the color is fantastic.  in short, if you watch the garden of allah with a lenient attitude and embrace its silliness, you can't help but enjoy it.",1
"this hitchcock movie bears little similarity to his later suspense films and seems much more like a very old fashioned morality tale. a young couple receives an inheritance that they believe will make them happy. they spend the money traveling about the world and living a very hedonistic existence. however, after a while the excitement begins to wane and the couple become dissipated and pointless in their existence. however, out of no where, when they are on a luxury cruise, the ship sinks and they lose everything--and end up much happier in the end because they now appreciate life! what an odd, silly and preachy film! personally, i'd like to inherit all that money and find out if it makes me miserable!  the production values are relatively poor compared to later productions--a rough film with poor sound quality and rather amateurish acting.",0
"i cheer for films that fill in subject matter gaps in world cinema. so after watching the trailer for ""water lilies,"" i expected to like this film because i thought i'd stumbled on something unique: a movie that honestly portrays teen lesbian love - sort of a female version of ""beautiful thing.""   the main characters are young french women 15 years old. marie is slender, reticent and pretty in a tomboyish way; floriane is outgoing, athletic and beautiful; and anne is loyal, pudgy and behaviorally immature. the erotic interrelationship between marie and floriane is always simmering in this movie, if not at the surface, then just below it.   ""water lilies,"" however, is not about the dawning of lesbian love upon two teens; it is about sexual frustration, suffering, ennui, teens working at cross-purposes and - in at least two instances - joyless, mechanical sex. it also proves that screenwriters and film-makers mar their own creations when they become too manipulative.  in the extra features on the ""lord of the flies"" dvd, director peter brook says, ""french cynicism starts with the arousal of sex,"" meaning the french regard children as angels while they regard adolescents and adults with a pervasive cynicism. part of the downfall of this film is film-maker celine sciamma has gulped a mighty dose of this cynicism.  ""where is the joy?"" i asked myself while watching this film. yes, first love can be painful and frustrating, but it can also be joyful and triumphantly erotic in a fresh, life-affirming way. these positive aspects are missing from this movie; there is no balance.  organically, this movie wants to be a poignant celebration of first love. but sciamma is too impressed with her own cynicism and cleverness and ruins the film. first, what is the point of showing only the plump girl nude? i know there is an established tradition of tasteful teen nudity in european cinema, as evidenced by films like ""the slingshot; the rascals; the devil, probably; the little thief; murmur of the heart; friends; beau pere"" and ""europa, europa""; but this instance is a petty authorial intrusion - ""see, audience, i can make a film where i show only the unattractive person nude."" either no nudity or evenly distributed nudity would've been an honest way to go.  there is a scene in a club where floriane and marie are dancing. what follows next is not just floriane cynically manipulating marie; it is film-maker sciamma cynically manipulating her audience.  perhaps the biggest betrayal of authenticity and organic honesty takes place when floriane warns marie she's about to request something that is ""not normal."" marie understandably asks, ""who cares about being normal?"" then sciamma plays false with her audience and the hurtling momentum of the movie, because floriane's request is a phony, derivative and substitute question - not the authentic, heartfelt question the movie, marie's character and the viewers who've invested their time deserve.   here are also two moments which clank falsely on the viewer's nerves: 1) since when do the french - of all people - take baths wearing bathing suits, and with a turtle to boot? 2) what teen - of any nationality - would chomp down on an apple core that's been thrown in the garbage in order to get a taste of the beloved's mouth?  the three main actresses are promising and, if they find better vehicles for their talents, may become excellent actors. louise blachere (anne) is the best actress in terms of technique and could have a successful career in supporting roles. adele haenel (floriane) could become a leading lady, or a bombshell, or both. pauline acquart (marie) possesses an intensity and magnetism which are unmistakable. in the future, she could play everything from an emotionally crippled librarian to a mysteriously sensual seductress to a reluctant politician riding a meteoric rise in acclaim.  all in all, ""water lilies"" was very disappointing. will an honest film-maker please make an authentic movie about two young women falling in love! no - not necessarily for the sake of this middle-aged guy - but so young lesbian girls can have something of quality they can watch and identify with. and yes, to fill a subject matter gap in world cinema.",0
"a family traveling for their daughter's softball league decide to take the 'scenic route' and end up in the middle of nowhere. the father is an avid photographer, and when he hears of an old abandoned side show in the town, he decides to take another detour to take some photographs.  of course, the side show is filled with inbred freaks, who promptly kidnap the women and leave the young son and father to fend for themselves.  the only cool thing about this film is how the family actually fights back against their inbred captors. other than that, there's nothing worthwhile about the film.",0
although dig! was being hailed as being closest to what the music industry is like it is highly fabricated. the director has misled the audience into believing the brian jonestown massacre disappeared off the face of the earth post-'98. and the rivalry between the dandy warhols and jonestown has been milked. the truth of the matter is not really exposed in this film.  that said this film is endlessly quotable and is an interesting watch as we get a look at two groups of very talented musicians creating their art. one of the best things this film has going for it is a unique perspective between the indie music scene and the larger corporate scene.  recommended mostly for the music and the two fantastic bands.,1
"i just saw this film yesterday.  my girlfriend wanted to see it only because of richard gere.  i feel i wasted my time and money and told my girlfriend it's the last time we go to see a film just because a certain actor/actress is in it. i hope she learned the lesson because i had trouble keeping her in her seat. as of me, since i paid already, i wanted to see the end at least, just in the hope something good would turn up, but i didn't hold my breath, and luckily so cause i would have been a victim of the film just the same.  this is not a black and white film, it's a black and black one. the main character (richard gere) is almost as bad as his registrants, and all sex offenders are portrayed as unredeemable hard core criminals and the bad ones among them were really very very bad. speak of a cliché and the exploitation of a typical us phobia.  richard gere's acting was good as usual but the blond girl that's supposed to replace him was wishy washy at best. totally unconvincing for the job.  the film tries to exploit a popular theme and gives it a cheap, dramatic, and sensational turn that just is unreal. they just use sex offenders as an excuse to indulge in cheap violent acts of murders, vigilante beating, rape and torture - something that almost seems gratuitous. they even have a wolf attacking people in the film - how low can you get.  i gather the film won't come out in the usa and will go straight to dvd. that's were it should have stayed in other countries too, but because it's hollywood and richard gere they just had to show it. believe me, without gere, the film is not even worth a b-series movie.",0

"if this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on ""facts"" that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter. many of the smaller facts were disregarded (carter was not number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of ""racist"" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to giardello. why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. ruben carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. everyone knows that jewison can direct, and washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself? now thats inspirational) based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, i would suggest passing on this one.",0

"i really wanted to like this movie, but ended up bored and incredulous. the first shot is a camera feed from a robot traveling towards a bomb and is, naturally, shaky. but then the rest of the movie stays in shakycam mode, even during quiet conversational moments, to the point of ridiculousness. have the rental houses run out of tripods and steadicams? the fact that it was shot on 16mm doesn't help, as the entire movie is grainy as well as shaky.   for all the effort bigelow put into accurate vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring errors and inconsistencies that they undermine the movie's credibility.   - a car would not erupt in flames after a single shot, and once engulfed would not be extinguished by a small hand-held extinguisher.   - a single humvee would not be driving around baghdad in 2004, but would be backed up by other vehicles in case of breakdown or attack. - it would be exceptionally unlikely to be able to hit a running insurgent at long range, where the bullet is clearly taking over a second to reach the target.   - i believe bombs were brought to designated disposal areas on or near a base, not some random spot in the middle of the desert.   - the oil tanker attack is stated to have occurred in the green zone, a highly secure area that experienced very few attacks from within. the zone is mostly offices and palaces with few residences, yet it is portrayed as a dangerous warren of dark alleys and lurking insurgents. oddly, james never gets in trouble for the ridiculous tactic of ordering his two companions to each take an alley by themselves, thus setting up the attempted kidnapping.   - speaking of which, the 3-man team is always depicted clearing buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even when there are clearly dozens of soldiers right there.   - how many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging out a window to figure out he's not faking it?  there were no establishing shots to show the viewer what the size and layout of the base was or where baghdad was in relation. i had no idea who the eod team reported to, nor were any other characters fleshed out. these are things the characters would know, so we should too.  many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable. yes, it's obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will get into trouble with the iraqis he's trying to move along, that the choice of cereals back home will be overwhelming, and that a driver you kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle.  finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. renner's character from the beginning has a troubled relationship at home, is reckless and addicted to adrenalin. he's exactly the same at the end of the movie. what's the point?  if this is indeed the best so far of the iraqi war movies, it's a sorry bunch. just based on the half hour i saw of it, i'd recommend generation kill on hbo instead.",0
"after watching this movie i was honestly disappointed - not because of the actors, story or directing - i was disappointed by this film advertisements.  the trailers were suggesting that the battalion ""have chosen the third way out"" other than surrender or die (polish infos were even misguiding that they had the choice between being killed by own artillery or german guns, they even translated the title wrong as ""misplaced battalion""). this have tickled the right spot and i bought the movie.  the disappointment started when i realized that the third way is to just sit down and count dead bodies followed by sitting down and counting dead bodies... then i began to think ""hey, this story can't be that simple... i bet this clever officer will find some cunning way to save what left of his troops"". well, he didn't, they were just sitting and waiting for something to happen. and so was i.  the story was based on real events of world war i, so the writers couldn't make much use of their imagination, but even thought i found this movie really unchallenging and even a little bit boring. and as i wrote in the first place - it isn't fault of actors, writers or director - their marketing people have raised my expectations high above the level that this movie could cope with.",0
"brief encounter is a ghastly and pointless remake of the 1945 david lean classic, which was based on noel coward's play ""still life"". a doctor removes a particle of grit from a woman's eye at a railway station, he is in a miserable relationship, she is happily married social worker of italian ancestry. they meet by accident on another occasion, form an instant attraction and arrange to meet each other every wednesday. the pair fall in love, but after spending a few afternoons together they realise that they have no realistic chance of happiness and agree to part. coward's original one-act play concerned two ordinary people who fall in love. sophia loren and richard burton, two super stars and veterans of hollywood epics, are nobody's idea of 'ordinary people'. loren in particular is miscast - sophia loren in full make-up, looking like a million dollars, working as a part-time voluntary social worker at a citizen advice bureau just doesn't ring true. burton, looking haggard, with dyed hair, too much make-up and wearing platform shoes, doesn't come across as your average general practitioner. that said, you can't really blame them for having an affair after seeing their spouses. burton is married to a literary critic who spends her evenings penning poisonous reviews and who treats her husband with total contempt. loren's husband, jack hedley, potters around the house all day and is terminally boring: the most exciting thing he has ever done is nearly have an affair six years previous. their final scene together will induce nausea, (""you've been a long, long way away"", etc.). that great british jobbing actor, john lemesurier, has a three minute cameo as burton's friend, and appears to be slightly inebriated, speaking his lines in a barely audible voice. it's a sad and forgettable performance in a dismal, awful rehash of a cinema classic. avoid at all costs.",0
"another excellent arnold movie. this futuristic movie has great action in it, and is one of arnie's best movies. arnold is framed as a bad guy in this movie and plays a game of death. this movie is excellent and a great sci-fi / action movie. i've always liked this movie and it has to be one of the greatest adventure movies of all time. 10 out of 10! perfection",1
"this movie starts out very very slow, but when the action finally gets started, it's a little had to follow. i couldn't understand why some of the events were taking place, and a lot of events happened before they were explained, making them sort of confusing. the only thing it really has going for it is the massive amount of blood/gore it has, although most times the special effects are lacking. blood looks like red kool-aid. skin tearing sounds like somebody is stepping on a pile of sticks. again, the story has a sort of amateur feel to it, like the writer didn't take a long time to perfect it. i feel like it could be a much better movie if the effects were done better and more time was taken on the script. i honestly wish i hadn't watched it, not because of the gore, but because i feel that i wasted 90 minutes of my life. if you like extremely gory movies, this is for you, if not, stay away.",0

"six gis, about to be send home and discharged, get drunk and sneak into a cult meeting in asia. surrounded by hooded figures, two male dancers pretend to have a fight. behind them, on an altar, a woven basket opens and a figure painted emerges and begins imitating a snake, finally biting one of the dancers on the neck. the imitation snake is dressed in some scaley looking body tights. (this is definitely a female imitation snake.) the cult member who has sneaked them into the secret meeting has warned the six men repeatedly that the ceremonies must not be interrupted and, most definitely, no photos must be taken or else they will be hunted down and killed. naturally, the gis take a flash photo, send the cult members into an angry hysteria, steal the basket containing the ""snake"" and run off with it into the asian night.  one of the guys, the most offensive and snarky, dies from a cobra bite on the neck, though no one can explain how the snake got into his hospital room.  back in new york, it all seems rather old news as the discharged men settle down into their civilian lives, still maintaining their bond with one another. their jobs range from manager of a bowling alley (david janssen) to graduate research student (richard long). james dobson, jack kelly, and marshall thompson are also part of the neighborhood. richard long has a nice blond girl friend. kelly is a somewhat reckless womanizer. but they all get along well enough and all of them seem happy.  then a dark, shifty-looking, mysterious woman (faith domergue) shows up and marshall thompson takes a liking to her and insinuates her into the group.  guess what happens. first janssen is terrified by a shadow in the back seat and dies in a car crash. then kelly gets a visit from domergue. something scares him so badly he tumbles through the window and dies in the fall to the sidewalk. long and dobson begin to suspect what the viewer already knows -- that domergue has had something to do with the deaths. they also reckon that maybe she's turning into a cobra, which is the case. dobson confronts her with his suspicions and she proves his point.  by this time long and thompson are thoroughly frazzled, particularly thompson, who is in love with domergue and has discovered that she is attracted to him, too, although he must explain to her what ""love"" is. no matter. a final reckless attack by the cobra woman against long's girl friend -- not one of the six original offenders -- and thompson must throw the snake out the window. on the pavement below, the body changes to that of domergue. the end.  i think i'll skip over most of the questions that the plot raises. i'll just mention one of the more prosaic ones in passing. who paid for domergue's fare from somewhere in asia to new york? who's paying her utility bills in the hotel? who paid for her spectacular wardrobe? how come she speaks american english so well? what the hell's going on? the writers and director have clearly seen some of val lewton's modest horror films and, though not much effort has gone into this production, they've unashamedly stolen some gimmicks from lewton. in lewton's ""the cat people"", for instance, the woman is transformed into a black leopard but, with one tiny exception, the threat is always kept in the shadows and is all the more spooky for it. most of the transformations here use shadows too, but unlike lewton's, the shadows are clumsy and unambiguous.  lewton also made occasional use of what he called ""buses"". lewton's first ""bus"" was a literal one. a potential victim is hurrying alone through the dark tunnels of central park with only the sound of footsteps. something or someone is following her. she freezes with fright under a street lamp. something rustles the branches of the shrubs above her. she looks upward. there is a loud, wheezing shriek that makes your hair stand on end. it's a bus using its air brakes to stop for her. the producers used at least two ""buses"" in this film and they amount to nothing. a guy is walking distractedly across an intersection, for instance, and there is the sudden rumble of a truck that almost hits him. there is no set up to the shot. it's jammed in with a shoe horn.  i don't much care for movies that perpetuate the stereotype of serpents as slimy, ugly, venomous, and phallic. as a matter of fact, no snakes are slimy, most are harmless, and many are extraordinarily beautiful. furthermore, they're more feminine than masculine in their sinuous movements and serpentine approach to goals. you want a reptilian symbol for masculinity? try a six-lined racerunner. it's a really fast lizard. when it sees something to eat, it rushes up and gobbles it down.  anyway, if you want to see some fine, low-budget scary films, don't bother with this one. find ""the cat people"" or one of lewton's other minor masterpieces, of which this is an obvious copy.",0

"first of all, i ain't american or middle-eastern. second of all, i don't have a religion. the closest thing to a religion i have are sports and movies. henceforth, i believe i would be best served to supply an opinion of neutrality and free from bias.  most of these short films are an utter disgrace. this dreadful event should be used to commemorated all those innocent people whom were murdered by ""some"" barbaric and uncivilized morons. instead, most of what i saw in these short films were conceited attempts to score varied political points. examples:  1) ken loach's segment. sure, we are all sad that this dude had a hard life in his country but what has that got to do with the innocent victims of 2001? two wrongs don't make a right?! whatever! this film should have a subtitle for those who have trouble listening to a partially incoherent chilean-english accent.  2) most disturbing is youssef chahine's segment. it is obvious that he has trouble with logic. he justified the murders due to - america being a democracy and because some americans voted the politicians in power, then all americans in the end are responsible for the actions and decisions made by their leaders on the middle-east. helloooo! is this guy for real?? some americans don't even vote! some americans don't even know where the middle-east is; some don't even know what religion is practiced there; and majority don't know the real political issues that are played behind the scenes. ### mr chahine, the reason why we have all these problems in the world is because there are too many people with your kind of logic. the innocent victims in the twin towers came from around the world. the murdered firefighters, rescuers, office workers, by-standers and flight passengers have nothing to do with politics. and yet, we are not allowed to go about our lives because ""some"" people think everyone has to choose a side or a religion. we are perceived as fair game for the extreme politics.  3) the israeli segment showed their own bombed victims. another filmmaker using this event to push their own political agenda. sometimes, it is not about you. some people always think about the ""me, me, me."" sometimes, it is about other people.  4) idrissa ouedraogo's segment is a joke and another political point scorer. they obviously want money from the international community by highlighting their poverty. blah, blah, blah.  this movie denigrates the memory of ""sept. 11th, 2001"" victims.  the best thing for it is the trash can.",0
"well - when the cameo appearance of jason miller (looking even more eroded than he did in exorcist iv) is the high point of a picture, what've you got?  it's a little bit country, a little bit rock n' roll: mix two drunks with money who drag their kid all over the place with a bog-dried mummy (have you figured that one out yet - dried in a bog?) in the basement, christopher walken with a bad dye job, and a little girl who might have been an interesting character if they'd developed her.  i understand - sort of - that they're going back to visit her relatives. after that....  problem: there are several interesting flashbacks to what i must assume is her mother being killed in a car bombing (i think). this is never connected to anything.   problem: what do we need the grandmother for? now, the grandmother could be interesting. she speaks gaelic, or celtic, or something. maybe you can make something of her. the best they can do is that she 's got a tobacco habit. that's all.  problem: they cast a real shifty character as the husband. is he type-cast (will he sell his wife to the devil? maybe he can look forward to the trust fund he manages for her)or is he cast against type (after all, he has a good haircut and nice clothes)? he drinks, he hesitates. he's not a bad guy. not a good one. but dislikable. why didn't they do something with him?  no problem: an old boyfriend shows up. the husband knocks him down. he comes back to knock down the husband. (it gets pretty stupid, but at least that character has motivation.)   now - she's an alcoholic, he's an alcoholic; he might only have married her for her money. the grandmother is locked in the bedroom. the blind uncle takes our heroine to the basement to show her the mummy of a witch (are you following this?) who may come to life. in fact, you know she'll come to life, the music swells. a little girl lives in the house, takes tea to the grandmother (unlocks the door to do so) and provides granny with cigarettes. periodically, granny gets out. but nothing happens.   husband and wife lose the kid in the house, subsequently lose their bedroom. uncle gets his throat cut in the basement. the leading lady has nose-bleeds. the husband drinks. they both drink. in the face of all of this, the awful truth alluded to in the first over-voice is - omigod - an abortion when the leading lady was twelve years old.  in spite of all these dangling-thread ingredients, nobody managed to get a story on the screen. no bridge between situations, no graduation from mild disturbance to awful horror, just long slow scenes that go nowhere.;nbody, really, to care about - and they had places to go with that aspect - the innocent kid in the charge of drunks,the grandmother who might be locked up because she's a monster, but no, her worst fault is smoking. she's got great hair, good makeup.   in short, no plot. just a little random (predictable)violence in a dark library, with the rain gushing in, and the sound track cuing us in. you need more than a few drunks and christopher walken to make a movie.  the production values were good. oh. nice scenery, good wardrobe. the cameraman, at least, knew what he was doing.  i bought it. poor me.",0
"normally i'm not motivated to write reviews. but this movie was so excruciatingly painful i feel i must. i cringed at the appallingly predictable plot, the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense. indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the ""most tense"" moment of the movie. molly ringwald stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production. even the ""twist"" at the end wasn't. i've heard it said that the movie didn't take itself seriously; but i could find little evidence of that in the movie.  cut should have been left on the cutting room floor. do yourself a favour and spend your time and money on something else!",0
"in this forgettable trifle, the 40-ish norma shearer plays a fluttery, girlish socialite in monte carlo, caught in a tussle between george sanders and robert taylor. it would be tempting to blame this movie's failure on the dull, talky script, or director george cukor, who never seems interested in livening up the film's generally comatose state. mostly, though, it's the fault of shearer herself, who desperately wanted to keep playing ""young"" parts as long as she could get away with it. inadvertently, this makes ""her cardboard lover"" a bizarre monument to an aging woman's vanity.",0
"what was the purpose of this film? i suggest it was to make a handful of actors and their producers and director a big payday for doing nothing. even my favorite actor, bruce dern, couldn't keep my interest in this boring movie. a braindead ex-pugilist falls in with a weird woman and her relatives. he starts out as a fix-it man for the woman, and winds up beating a man and getting caught up in a kidnapping scheme. it was so confusing i can't even write a decent critique. if you see this one, my sweet, make sure it is after dark so you can go right to sleep.",0
"slaughter high the tale of revenge by a nerdy guy who fell victim to one of the coolest and coldest jokes in cinema history. unfortunately after the promising opening the flick went straight to hell. a very tedious and redundant mess with mediocre slashings and a final half hour that sucked on a whole new level of suckiness. the guy who played the nerd actually killed himself shortly after the flick was released. if you wanna rent the flick stop it after the prank and remember, choose life.",0
"the movie started off strong, ll cool j (deed) as an undercover police officer, with partner sgt. lazerov (dylan mcdermott from the practice, possibly miscast as a bad guy?) committing robbery and murder. deed refuses to kill the drug dealer, which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience. the other big names (freeman, spacey et al) are well cast and the movie shows promise.  the movie begins to fall short as soon as justin timberlake (pollack) is introduced. given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly, or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of timberlake, i would choose the former. even talented actors have to work hard at their craft; timberlake is not talented and no amount of hard work can save him. i would have thought he would put on a better show, given the fact that he has been acting talented for years. everything he did in this film was unconvincing.  just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums, it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films. even hardcore n'sync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talent.  that aside there are a few plot holes, such as pollack's sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery. this movie had so much promise. thoroughly disappointing.",0
"i don't hand out ""ones"" often, but if there was ever a film that deserved this sort of attention, it's ""gas!"" this is self-indulgent crap that reaches for some of the ambiance of m*a*s*h and falls completely flat on its face in the attempt.  i see what corman was going for - malcolm marmorstein and elliott gould tried to reproduce gould's deathless role in the original movie version of m*a*s*h with a similar plot (in the movie ""whiffs"" - look it up here in imdb, http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0073891/ for more information).  marmorstein and gould got closer to the brass ring with ""whiffs"" than corman did with ""gas!"" but didn't quite get there. neither one of those films even got close to the success of m*a*s*h.  what's wrong with ""gas!""? what isn't? no one comes close to really acting at a level above junior high school theatrics. the production values stink. someone else here mentioned the magically regenerating headlights on a getaway car, and there's more of that lack of attention to detail. nothing works the way it's supposed to in this film, and nobody cares.  ""gas!"" actually put me to sleep. it's not a sure cure for insomnia, but really close. on the cinematic sleep induction scale, ""gas!"" falls somewhere between ""last year at marienbad"" and george clooney's remake of ""solaris"" (which itself was remarkable for being more boring than the mosfilm original, despite that studio's seeming unfamiliarity with the idea of keeping the audience's attention by judicious editing).  judicious editing would have decimated ""gas!"" to about twenty minutes. the result would be pointless, but no more so than the original film.  certain films are so bad that they have a compelling quality that makes them worth watching anyway. this isn't one of them. don't waste your time. it's not even amusingly bad.",0
"i have to say that the events of 9/11 didn't hit me until i saw this documentary. it took me a year to come to grips with the devastation. i was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on tv if there was any talk about the towers. i was sick of hearing about it. when this was aired on tv a year and a day later, i was bawling my eyes out. it was the first time i had cried since the attack. i highly recommend this documentary. i am watching it now on tv, 5 years later, and i am still crying over the tragedies. the fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing. it was an accident, and look where it got them. these two brothers make me want to have been there to help.",1

"when i saw previews of this movie i thought that it may be dumb, but it will at least be funny. well i was wrong. even though somewhere deep down the producers had an interesting message to convey about parents being left alone and re-evaluating their life, the way they tried to deliver that message was horrible. the first fifty times something silly happened to the couple was relatively funny. but by the end, i could almost predict what stupid mishap is going to happen next.  throughout the movie i like a total of maybe five lines of dialogue and everything else was at best mediocre, which is still more than i can say for the movie itself.",0

"when i saw this movie i heard all the hype, and i heard how people said that denzel deserved the oscar alongside his golden globe and i believed he must have done an outstanding job considering kevin spacey was excellent. i was wrong. i realize that people say this not to anger the african american community (if they are not african americans themselves). i always hear complaints on how african americans are never nominated and how they should have won. sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because whoppi goldberg should have won best actress for the color purple and the movie should have won best picture. the only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*semi-spoiler*) hardships of an african american during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.  denzel washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever. i was bored with him in the movie, and his acting here was quite similar to his role in malcolm x but not as good. the audience is supposed to leave believing this man, rubin carter, is a saint. people left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.  *spoilers* this movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit. of course the crimes he did commit (stealing mostly) was only to survive, nothing more. people felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view. i do not like movies (especially hollywood interpretations) that are based on ""true"" stories because they usually distort the ""true"" parts into something else, something not so true. this was his point of view and a hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably. well i researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man. not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people. if you do not believe me, search for him on the internet, and read the articles some people have of him. the boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent joey giardello and there are tapes to prove it. besides that, there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie. the supporting cast were the nicest people i have ever seen on the face of the earth and their ""nice and perfect"" persona looked difficult to keep up.  this movie was a hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully. denzel's acting is stale, and the supporting cast's mickey mouse attitudes are annoying. the movie also begins very slow paced and is boring.",0
"it's my opinion that when you decide to re-make a very good film, you should strive to do better than the original; or at least give it a fresh point of view. now the 1963 robert wise telling of shirley jackson's remarkable novel ""the haunting of hill house"" is worth the price of admission even today. now fast forward to 1999 and the re-make. i was left shaking my head and asking, why? the acting is wooden, the story unrecognizable and the whole point seems to be to replace the subtle horror of the original with as many special effects computers can generate. i had heard that this update was bad; but couldn't believe it was that bad, considering the source material. i was wrong. after watching this and saying to my wife how awful it was, she said; ""well they got your money!"" she's right, don't let them get yours. if there's no profit in making lousy re-makes, maybe they'll stop making them or come up to a higher standard that doesn't insult their audience",0
"what a wasted opportunity to actually make an interesting film about a complicated subject. there is very little exploration about what it really feels like to be a straight (or gay) man working in a gay sexual environment.the dancers keep talking about their art as if it has no erotic component. they may not all be prostitutes for hire, but they are indeed sex workers playing out fantasies and selling private sessions where more than dancing is offered. from the film one would get the impression that they mainly appeal to the women who go to the gay clubs and then end up hiring the ""dancers"" for private sessions. even the shots in the club only show women in front of the stage and the ""dancers"" only playing to the women in the audience. this just isn't the reality of these clubs. it would be pretty hard to make a living doing private dances for straight women and couples. so what do they really feel about their gay admirers and clients? we learn very little. instead we get filler. a gay activist who adds nothing to the study of straight dancers. a manager who tells us about the costumes for the drag acts but offers no insight into the dancers' lives and attitudes.  the pictures of mexico city are generic. the phallic montage showing sausages roasting is ridiculous.  this is a totally simplistic film which should be of interest only to those who want to see a few pictures of pretty boys dancing. the rest of the movie is an insult to gay men.",0
the pallbearer is a disappointment and at times extremely boring with a love story that just doesn't work partly with the casting of gwyneth paltrow (julie). gwyneth paltrow walks through the entire film with a confused look on her face and its hard to tell what david schwimmer even sees in her.  however the pallbearer at times is funny particularly the church scene and the group scenes with his friends are a laugh but that's basically it. watch the pallbearer for those scenes only and fast forward the rest. trust me you aren't missing much.,0
"as a 90 minute experience, it is not up to the standard of `drive', as the actors clearly learnt their trade at the `who am i?' academy, while the action sequences are generally no better than those in the superb mark dacascos beat 'em-up. however, those who enjoyed `drive', (and i thought it was wonderful!), will undoubtedly enjoy this too. you certainly won't rewind back to the start and watch it all again, but you will definitely flick back to some of the action scenes for a long time to come.   it is refreshing to see that the art of quality fight choreography is still being practiced, even if not in hong kong, and i would love to see what these guys could do with the budgets, time and respect afforded to the likes of yuen woo-ping and corey yuen kuei. if you sit through the first half hour and aren't sent crazy by the atrocious dialogue then you are in for a treat. bosch is magnificent, and can really bust a move with some magnificent acrobatics, kicks and simple acts of bravery.   if you are fortunate enough to be within 500 miles of a copy, then track it down and watch it. it's not shakespeare. in fact, it's less articulate than coolio in `china strike force', but you will be impressed with both the moves on display and the pain felt by the stunt team - (i'm pretty sure there's no safe way to land directly on your head, or be forced to head butt a wooden roof by a speeding car!?).

"if you're going to look after a child, make sure they don't live anywhere near a graveyard. especially if said kid has a habit of drawing gory pictures and disappears at night among the tombstones to see her 'friends'. but, our long haired heroine, oblivious to all the signs, shacks up with her family the nortons, which include a strict father and a dullard older brother who becomes a love interest for our budding babysitter. even more spooky than the zombie gang outside is the cast's tendency to talk even when their lips aren't moving, and for the words to not match the movement of their mouths. but enough of that.. domestic animals are being sacrificed, old ladies are having eyeballs torn out and the orchestra won't shut up during any scene, even the quiet ones. oh, and the editor is having a day off going by the way the film drones on.  in fact, it would been better if everybody involved had taken a breather, smelt what they'd signed up for and gone awol. yes, i know it's hard to get into movies these days, but this sort of starter point is not one on your cv you'd want. if would be like a trainee farm labourer having a conviction for chicken molesting. featuring one of the worst lead performances ever by the shrill laurel barnett, and another almost equally as bad by the charisma-free child actress rosalie cole (the next dakota fanning she ain't) the film meanders on and on with nothing but padding until we get what passes for a climax.  this involves five or six members of the undead barricading our utterly useless heroine in a shed, while her bit of rough fends off these ghouls with a plank of wood, a one shell shotgun and whatever he can lay his hands on. but back up a minute.. earlier on they were in the car, and they accidentally discovered that the creatures found the noise of the horn so repellent they shuffled off at the sound of it. so do they stay where they are safe? no of course not, they run off to this abandoned building in the middle of nowhere, so the bloke can prove what a hardnut he is the girl can act like she's having a nervous breakdown.  finally, the film closes. it doesn't end, it just goes to a grinding halt. the main character wanders back to her vehicle covered in fake blood, as if nothing horrible had happened. but, my dear viewer, something horrible has happened. you have just sat through one of the most lamebrained, boring horror films you're ever likely to see, and lost 82 minutes of your life you'll never get back. just think.. years from now on your deathbed, what you'd trade an hour and 22 minutes for just to spend a bit of extra time with your family. sadly, it's already too late for me. don't you make the same mistake :( 2/10",0

"there aren't many good things to say at all about underneath, soderbergh's untrue endeavor into neo-noir. soderbergh remakes robert siodmak's decent noir criss-cross faithfully, not altering the plot very much at all, however the adaptation drains it of every ounce of its state-of-the-art film noir atmosphere, giving it the same story set in the very least appealing places, lifestyles and anachronisms. soderbergh, who would later make wonderful crime films like out of sight and the ocean's series with great style and atmosphere, takes the dangerously obvious route to modernization by renovating the story with the ugliest, dullest and flattest fashions of the early 1990s. nightclubs have terrible, revoltingly dressed garage bands, peter gallagher's uninteresting version of burt lancaster's anti-hero is left by his femme fatale girlfriend for compulsively buying cinematically lifeless modern appliances like stereos, tvs, and other up to date pieces of equipment that suck the reaction out of the film.  it could've been more entertaining and less boring had it a few saving graces like a good score, more flesh to its characters, more than just william fichtner giving performances that aren't wooden, a crisper pace. unfortunately, underneath has none of these things. soderbergh, a fine director, does not utilize his dry detachment to the benefit of his film this time. that disposition works wonderfully when he's helming a crime movie with more tongue in its cheek like the george clooney pictures previously mentioned, or a social or character drama like traffic or sex, lies and videotape. with a movie like underneath, it intensifies the boredom experienced by the viewer.",0
"i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol. 1 collection of pure euro-trash movies. but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there. stupednous it is not... satisfying it is! watching this movie i couldn't help to wonder... how come sergio martino didn't make this flick? this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech (alas not as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii). double-crosses and triple-crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second. did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through? besides lee's more recognizable films, film-goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would've lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time (and 1/4 of the budget) this is what it would've turned out to be like. so refreshing, it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matinée",1
"i have to say that higher learning is one of the top 3 movies i have ever watched. it has a brilliant cast, and an equally brilliant director. singleton shows how life in university can be. there are 3 main story lines, the skinheads, the african-americans, and the homosexuals. i was intrigued by all of the stories, but the one that got to me the most was the storyline about kristen, battling her feelings towards another girl. the end was great. after seeing the movie 25 times plus, i still cry. i would have given this movie an 11, but i have to settlefor 10/10.",1
"first off, this is an excellent series, though we have sort of a james bond effect. what i mean is that while the new casino royale takes place in 2006, it is chronologically the first adventure of 007, dr. no (1962) being the second, while in golden eye, the first film with pierce brosnan, judi dench is referred to as the new replacement for the male ""m"" so how could she have been in place in the beginning before bond became a double-0, aside from the fact that she is obviously 14 years older? this is more or less a ""poetic"" license to thrill. we need to turn our heads aside a bit if we wish to be entertained. no, the new star trek movie does not have any of the primitive electronics of the original series from nearly half a century ago. in the 1960's communicators were fantasy. (now we call them cell phones) and there were sliding levers instead of buttons. omg, do you think 400 years from now, they would have perfected rogaine for jean-luc picard? so, please, let's give the producers some leeway.  but to try and make things a bit consistent, let us just ponder about the cylons creation just 60 years prior to the end of battlestar galactica. if that is the case, where did all the cylons that populated the original earth come from? we know that the technology exists for spontaneous jumps through space. well, what happened if one of the cyclon ships at war with the caprica fleet was fired upon or there was a sunspot or whatever and one ship, loaded with human-looking cylons, wound up not only jumping through space, but through time, back a thousand or ten thousand years with a crippled ship near earth one. they colonized it, found out they could repopulate it and eventually destroyed themselves, but not before they themselves sent out a ""ragtag"" fleet to search for the legendary caprica, only to find a habitable but unpopulated planet, which they colonized to become the humans, who eventually invented the cylons. time paradox? of course. which came first, the chicken or the road? who cares? it's fraking entertaining!",1
"raising victor vargas is a movie you definitely need to see. it was very heart felt and had a lot of humor that gets you sucked right in. it is so much like real life with what teenagers have to go through. victor, a cocky teen, but with a good heart at the end deals with love in all the right places dealing with girls and family. at the end victor learns the true meaning of love after dealing with a old fashioned grandmother and a girl who he wants to use is actually using him too.i recommend people to watch this movie because it will be like you are watching a real family. thats how much feeling this movie has. one heart felt moment was when victor's grandmother throws victor out over something simple. victor was really heart and couldn't believe that she would do something like that. it made me feel real sorry for him like it was real. overall i give this movie a b+",1
as an old white housewife i can still appreciate that laurence fishburne is one of our finest actors. anyone who appreciates his work like in deep cover might enjoy watching the incredible acting range of this actor. since i think this is his directorial debut it might prove even more interesting. all of the acting is quite good. if you can't take lower manhattan junky worlds or the reality of crime life (not glorified action shoot-em ups) then this is not a film you would enjoy. it is mr. fishburne's usual contribution to incredibly subtle relationships. i would love to see larry and anthony hopkins go at each other some day in a movie.,1
"this movie was like any jimmy stewart film,witty,charming and very enjoyable.kim novak's performance as gillian,the beautiful witch who longs to be human,is splendid,her subtle facial expressions,her every move and gesture all create gillian's unique and somewhat haunting character,she left us hanging on her every word.i should not fail to mention ernie kovacs' and elsa lanchester's highly commendable performances as the scotch loving writer obsessed with the world of magic(kovacs) and the latter as the lovable aunt who can't seem to stop using magic even when forbidden to.the romantic scenes between stewart and novak are beautifully done and the chemistry between them is great,but then again when is the chemistry between jimmy stewart and any leading lady bad!",1
"well, what are the odds! at the exact right moment that a few redneck amateur-scientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago, a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monster's egg that has been lying there  for over a thousand years, i suppose! ""the crater lake monster"" is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed, but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest. yes, this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing, but it's also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it. half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of arnie and mitch. these two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake, but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word ""bait"". it is mostly during their prototypic laurel & hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake. steve hanson, the heroic but not exactly sharp sheriff is on the case, but only if he's not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area. halfway through the film, there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process. this textbook ""wtf"" moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country, like in new york city or something, and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at crater lake. only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in hicksville and there's an ""exhilarating"" chase through the woods, ending in the dino's hungry muzzle. the absurd little details in ""the crater lake monster"" are too numerous to mention! for example, this is probably the only creature-feature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint after they already spotted the actual monster. the goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as i'm concerned. it's like everybody forgot to pay attention to it. night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight  all during one and the same diurnal course! the monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film, especially since it's accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop- motion effects. the cute critter is a plesiosaur; meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between denver the last dinosaur and an alligator. ""crater lake monster"" is a unique and unforgettable movie- experience that i can only encourage to track down! the miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle (and because basically, this is a very bad film) should be put into perspective, because i might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value.",0
"arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons. a good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away. if you look fast you can see frank graham during the restaurant scene in the background while dudley moore and jill eikenberry are in conversation. frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew him.  secondly though, i actually knew a real life arthur bach. he was not quite as wealthy as arthur, but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid. his parents tightly controlled his purse strings, but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in greenwich village. he spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself, just like dudley moore does.   the wonder with arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not. but that's the other half of the equation. my friend was a most charming person when you got to know him. in fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming. he couldn't buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor. he spent his life being a perfect party guest. the term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to him.  and that's what dudley moore is, a wastrel. unlike my friend moore has john gielgud to clean up after him. that's a full time job as we see demonstrated in arthur. my friend also never found a liza minnelli, a male liza minnelli in fact because he was gay. still moore's portrayal of arthur bach is deadly accurate and so real for me.  arthur, 20th century wastrel, is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in jill eikenberry. since he won't work for a living, the threat of being cut off is quite real for him. he only has his butler hobson played by john gielgud and chauffeur bitterman played by ted post to pour his troubles out to. we should all have such troubles.  john gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in arthur on film and in fact gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances. yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at oscar time. the academy gave henry fonda and katharine hepburn oscars for on golden pond and gielgud the best supporting actor award essentially for the work of a lifetime. that man was amazing, still at his craft almost to the end.  so to frank graham who worked in the film and to jackie weiss, a genuine real life arthur, i dedicate this review.",1
"farrah fawcett is superb in this powerful 1986 drama, where she plays marjorie, a woman who manages to escape the clutches of a would-be rapist. well done to farrah for being a golden globe 'best actress' nominee.  when her rapist joe (terrifically played by james russo) comes into her home, which she shares with her two roommates (who are conveniently out!), marjorie has to play along with joe's frightening demands. it does make for some disturbing and shocking images!  when her roommates come home, they are astounded (to say the least) by marjorie's actions, and a great performance by alfre woodard who desperately tries to convince marjorie to do the right thing and turn him into the police, makes the film even more nail-biting.  i do find diana scarwid quite irritating, but when joe finally admits that he came there to kill them all, it makes the film a very emotional piece of drama indeed.  overall, extremities is a brilliantly thought-out and well-acted movie and i must have watched it hundreds of time by now! well done to everybody involved.",1
"phantasm ....class. phantasm ii.....awesome. phantasm iii.....erm.....terrible.  even though i would love to stick up for this film, i quite simply can't. the movie seems to have ""sold out"". first bad signs come when the video has trailers for other films at the start (something the others did not). also too many pointless characters, prime examples the kid (who is a crack shot, funny initially but soon you want him dead), the woman who uses karate to fight off the balls (erm not gonna work, or rather shouldn't) and the blooming zombies (what the hell are they doing there, there no link to them in the other phatasms). also there is a severe lack of midgets running about.  the only good bits are the cracking start and, of course, reggie b.  (possible spoiler coming up)  to me this film seems like a filler between ii and iv as extra characters just leave at the end so can continue with main 4 in iv.  overall very, very disappointing. 3 / 10",0
"a comedy that worked surprisingly well was the little british effort ""the divorce of lady x (1938)"" . it marks the first pairing of laurence olivier and merle oberon, before that little film about uncontrollable passion on the 19th century english moors. and while olivier and oberon are not particularly well-suited to screwball comedy, it all flows along nicely. oberon is leslie, a young woman who ends up in priggish divorce lawyer logan's (olivier) hotel suite by way of a nasty english fog preventing travel. she does everything possible to irritate him--but, in the crazy way films go, he falls for her. and she falls for him. but a serious case of mistaken identity occurs when oberon's ""lady x"" (that's all she leaves oliver in a note) is thought by olivier to be a married woman. to make matters worse, and more amusing, lord mere (ralph richardson) goes to olivier wanting a divorce from his wife whom dear larry thinks must be oberon! there is some nice battle-of-the-sexes dialogue, and fun exploration of sexual politics. you can see that olivier is not too confident with the comedy, but in true olivier he's a consummate professional, and delivers. and he handles the screwball twists and turns, maybe not with ease, but with gusto. oberon was no great shakes as an actress, but she was usually competent enough, and despite their reputed off-screen dislike of her, worked well with olivier. this was filmed in early technicolour that looks very primitive today (everyone looks even whiter than michael jackson), but perhaps the print needs cleaning up.",1
"i got this movie in the $5 bin at walmart. i would not recommend watching this move. i might give it to one of my friends if i am angry at them and want them to suffer for 2 hours.  i looked at the cover and skimmed through the summary and thought it was a war movie. i wish i would have known how boring this movie was going to be before turning it on. it was my mistake to think something was going to happen in this movie. it's just about a group of people going from one boot camp to another. the drill sargents treat the soldiers very badly and the main character tries to help people get out of fighting in vietnam.  okay, here is my rant about this movie: to me, this movie is slow and hard to watch. it was just one of those movies that you put in and are stuck watching because you want to turn it off but your hanging on to a string of hope that it might pick up towards the end. it doesn't. after the movie was over i through it behind my t.v. because i was angry that i wasted almost 2 hours of my life watching it, and another 10 minutes writing this review to warn people about it.",0
"back in 1985 i caught this thing (i can't even call it a movie) on cable. i was in college and i was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control. i figured out early on that this was hopeless. stupid script (a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women), bad acting (with one exception) and pathetic jokes. the plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a while--but even he was bored after 30 minutes in. remember--this was a high school boy! this was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the internet and such. we kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened. the funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap! (one poster had a fictional review that said, ""this is the best movie i've seen this afternoon!""). only grant cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business. no-budget and boring t&a. skip it.",0
"this is very nearly a perfect film. the ideas would be repeated by mamet, but never told so succinctly. this is really about the failure of trust, of the human condition. the film weaves the idea that we are all criminals, no one is innocent. is there anyone alive today who hasn't seen this play out in our own society, every single day? the film is very much structured like a hitchcock thriller. except, there are no more innocent characters. the world is now completely polluted, ruined and everyone is participating in the con. could anything be more true?  don't miss the soundtrack. it is wonderful.",1
"i'm surprised at the comments from posters stating that jane powell made the same type of films deanna durbin did. although they were both young sopranos whose film images were crafted by joe pasternak, if this film is any indication, they were almost polar opposites.  while, in three smart girls, durbin plays an impulsive ""little miss fixit,"" who, after some setbacks, manages to reunite her divorced parents, in its' semi-remake, three daring daughters, jane powell almost destroys the marriage between her screen mom jeanette macdonald and new stepfather jose iturbi when she refuses to accept him and strong arms her younger siblings into rejecting him, too. from the durbin and powell films i've seen, i'd say these disparate qualities permeate the early films of both of these talented young performers.  as for durbin's performance in three smart girls, i find it completely winning, and most impressive. although it's clear from her occasionally shrill and over-emphatic line readings in some of the more energetic scenes that this is an early film for deanna, watching the self-confident, knowing and naturally effervescent manner in which she delivers her lines and performs overall, and the subdued and tender manner she projects the more serious scenes, you'd never guess that this was the first film role of a 14 year-old girl whose prior professional experience consisted almost exclusively of two years of vocal instruction.   given that this film, and durbin herself, were much publicized at the time as ""universal's last chance,"" the production must have been an impossibly stressful situation for a film novice of any age, but you'd never know it from the ease and assurance durbin displays on screen. although she's clearly still developing her acting style and demeanor before the camera (this was equally true of the early performances of much more experienced contemporaries like garland, rooney, o'connor and jane powell), durbin projects an extraordinary presence and warmth on camera that is absolutely unique to her, and, even here, in her first film, she manages to remain immensely likable despite the often quick-tempered impulsiveness of her character, and though she's occasionally shrill, she never for a second projects the coy and arch qualities that afflicted many child stars, including jane powell and some of the other young sopranos who followed in the wake of her success.  in short, like all great singing stars, durbin was much more than just a ""beautiful voice."" on the other hand, while durbin's pure lyric soprano is a truly remarkable and glorious instrument, the most remarkable thing about it, to me, was the way she is able to project her songs, without the slightest bit of affectation or ""grandnes"" that afflict the singing of adult opera singers like lily pons, grace moore and jeanette macdonald in films of the period  the film is also delightful, heavily influenced by screwball comedy, it backs durbin up with a creme-de-la-creme of first-class screwball pros such as charles winninger, binnie barnes, alice brady, ray milland and mischa auer. the story is light and entertaining. true, it's hardly ""realistic,"" but why would anyone expect it to be? if you want :""realistic"" rent the grapes of wrath or triumph of the will. on the other hand, if you're looking for a genuine, sweet, funny and entertaining family comedy with a wonderfully, charismatic and gifted adolescent ""lead,"" and terrific supporting players, this film won't let you down.",1

"i do try not to take imdb ratings to heart, but i was flabbergasted when i saw the 5.4 rating to one of my childhood favourites. it doesn't wow me as much at 17, but as a family film this is a sweet and well meaning movie. kids will definitely love it and won't mind the flaws, and the adults can guess the actor behind each character and admire the subliminal messaging of the film. none of the film was preachy in any way, in fact it has a great message that added to its sweetness. i will admit though that the story is on the thin side, and some scenes like screweyes's death(which still freaks me out) may be a tad on the scary side. but the animation is well above average with nice colours and good character animation. the music by james horner is very beautiful, and the song featured is memorable, catchy and amusing. i really liked the characters, louie is probably the most in-depth of them all, but the dinosaurs were at least engaging. martin short's clown was both hilarious and emphatic, the part when he tells screweyes ""i quit!"" had me in stitches. my favourite is screweyes though, an effective villain who is crafty and i suppose intelligent. if anything though, i wish the film kept in the part when he explains how he lost his eye and why he is scared of crows because that way he could've been more developed in terms of depth. the script, while not oscar-worthy, has its funny and heart-warming parts, and should keep kids and adults entertained. the voice acting for me was what made the movie. john goodman, martin short, rhea perlman, felicity kendall and yeardley smith all gave solid performances, but special mention has to go to kenneth mars for he was absolutely superb as screweyes and almost unrecognisable. all in all, this is a good movie. i don't get the rating, honestly i don't. sure this film isn't perfect, and it is not as good as a dinosaur movie such as land before time, but it is good fun. 7.5/10 bethany cox",1

"across the country and especially in the political landscape, people with any kind of political ambition, should take time out to see this film. the movie is called "" city hall "" and with little imagination, its synopsis can take place anywhere in america. it just so happens to open in new york. here we have the story of a popular politician named mayor john pappas (al pacino) with enough savvy to run a major metropolitan city with very little effort. his right-hand man is none other than deputy mayor kevin calhoun (john cusack) an equally bright individual who's ambitions are tied to his mentor and both seemed destined for higher office. everything points in that direction, until a police shooting ignites an investigation spearheaded by marybeth cogan (bridget fonda) who believes the guilt points towards city hall and the mayor. a six year old boy and a police officer's death are blamed on a career criminal who's questionable freedom leads to an apparent cover-up by political pay-offs and city corruption involving union leaders like danny aiello played by frank anselmo, corrupt judicial officials like judge walter stern. (martin landau) and mafia bosses like paul zapatti (anthony franciosa) who are deeply involved. also implicated, are party officials like larry schwartz (richard schiff) who works for the probation office of new york. but it is the bond between the mayor and his deputy which is taken to task by the accidental shooting. a great vehicle for cusack and a sure bet nominee to become a classic. ****",1
"the story goes something like this: a small-town girl, katie (jessica simpson), decides to visit her boyfriend in the big city. when she arrives she discovers he isn't quite as faithful as he should be. katie then ends up venturing into the adventure that is new york. filling in as bike messenger comedic and charming mishaps ensues. she falls into a hole in the ground and thus meets charismatic good-guy ben (luke wilson). it's not love at first sight, at least for her, but destiny and ben, won't give up quite that easy. being ""just"" a small-town girl and blonde a couple of evil executives at a building firm decides she's the perfect scapegoat for their cunning plan. misunderstandings with hilarious and sad consequences follow. however, this is one blonde who won't take it lying down!  people being judgmental of this film will soon enough be proved wrong. the jokes are confident and fitting, and the story well developed. the relationship between katie and ben feels so natural that it puts anything godard has created to shame. the multi-talented jessica simpson once again surprises with a strong role only she could pull off. simpson really is the marilyn monroe of our day (there's even one scene honoring her!). she balances perfectly between vulnerable and whimsy. katie really does show us that you can't judge a book by its cover! luke wilson is as charming as ever. even if he was covered in manure that man would be as appealing as anyone. his light touch, puppy dog eyes and laid back manner makes it difficult to resist. andy dick plays the role he was born to play, one of the two diabolical executives. he really cannot be underestimated. the strength of the performance lies in his restraint. it's remarkable, because most actors would just run away with it and play it for cheap laughs. not this guy!   in conclusion, director scott marshall has crafted an intelligent and frequently hilarious comedy that is destined to become a classic alongside masterpieces of cinema like epic movie and norbit. kudos to everyone involved in this, especially jessica simpson. her sincere smile and whole-hearted laughter would make even the toughest man break out in a big grin. you may be tough, but you're not that tough! warmly recommended to everyone who wants to be swept off their feet and see a romantic comedy that for once, feels honest. thank you for this film! oh, and the soundtrack rocks!   now if you still haven't gotten it. i'm being sarcastic. 1/10",0

"dreary. schlocky. just plain dreadful and awful. let's be honest, when you sit down to watch something called the double-d avenger you aren't expecting great art or even mild mainstream entertainment. you are probably expecting a cult film type and maybe get some good looks at some impressive busts. you don't get really either of these in the video. the story, as it consistent with most of these types, is inane: kitten natividad runs a local pub, finds out she has breast cancer, flies down to south america for a fruit that claims to be a panacea for any ills and a super-human abilities giver, returns and fights, dressed as the double-d avenger, a group from a local strip club wanting to edge out the competition. as stories go, i have seen a lot worse, but as another reviewer noted the execution is horrendous. the action sequences lack zip, drive, motivation, and are tissue thin. the acting isn't even properly campy and the dialog is the pits. nothing, and i mean nothing is funny from the wincing puns to the heavy-handed boob references. all could be forgiven if the girls could make up for it, but they all fall way short. kitten, haji, and raven de la croix are all quite older(still lovely in their own ways) yet expose nothing and become the antithesis of what they are trying to be: older, campy caricatures of their former selves. instead, they look so lame and desperate - more because of the vehicle they are ""starring"" in rather than their own abilities. there are some other lovely ladies, but you really do not see much of anything. pg -13 definitely could be an appropriate rating for this. the material, the actresses, and director are all tired, tiresome, and dated - and again - not funny! it was a brutal hour plus sitting through this, and that is a shame as i was expecting something campy and fun. the guy playing bubba by the way was the only real laugh for me. not that he was good at all mind you, but every time he opened his mouth i kept thinking how truly awful he was. the lone bright spot here at all is seeing mr. sci-fi himself, forrest j. ackerman, play the curator of a wax museum and chatting to his wax frankenstein affectionately called frankie. other than that this is a complete bust - now how is that for another tired, dreadful, trite pun!",0
"""semana santa"" or ""angel of death"" is a very weak movie. mira sorvino plays a detective who is trying to find a killer who shoots arrows in people. mira has an italian accent which falters from time to time. couldn't she just speak english? all the other characters have a forced mexican\english accent which is distracting. the dialogue is very bad and the delivery of it is wooden. the cinematography looks nice, but that's not enough to save this tripe. this next part of this review does contain spoilers!!!!   during the climax it looks like the villain is going to get away, but then he comes back down stairs to get shot and do a cool stunt down the railing. that just shows this script has no originality whatsoever. avoid!",0
"well the reason for seeing it in the cinema was that it was a sneak preview, else i would never have seen this terrible teenage slasher movie. i mean haven't we had enough of this yet? scream and scary movie at least did not take them self serious! the plot sucks, and the acting is the worst i've seen. (only godzilla can compare, which is also the only movie that competes in being the worst i've seen in the cinema with this one.)  there is so many plot holes in the story, and the girls are so alike, that you don't even now who has been killed, and who has not. (and you don't care.) the only of them i knew in advance was denise, and she was the most talent less actress i have ever seen in this bad excuse for a movie.  stay as far away from this movie as possible. (2/10)",0
"an interesting change from the first one. there was more mystery to this movie then the first. even when it ends your asking yourself what happened who was the killer. there are some good parts through the movie, the first half starts off slow and then in the last half the pace picks up. all up the movie is enjoyable. the story is 22 years after the events that occured in the first film, norman bates is out of an asylum and back to the bates motel, but when a woman turns up claiming to be his real mother, things start going wrong. perkins plays an aged norman well again and the scene at the end was excellent, he swang that spade awfully hard.",0
i read nothing but good things about this movie and finally had a chance to watch it late last night and it was everything i expected it to be and more.this is the way a proper horror movie should be.i think the reason it was so scary was because it was so realistic. the spooky sounding score was perfect for setting a dark mood.i liked the dramatic opening scene and enjoyed how the rest of the movie played out.it was very easy to follow and understand unlike some movies which are way too complicated.the special effects were very good.i would love to see more horror movies like this one.this is easily one of my favorite's.a realistic thunder and lightning storm would have set a nice atmosphere for this movie.other then that it had all the elements a good horror movie needs.i highly recommend this movie to anyone who can appreciate a good scary movie that pulls no punches.i will be adding it to my collection.the dvd has some interesting special features.,1
"can such an ambient production have failed its primary goal, which was to correctly adapt allende's novel? obviously yes. bille august managed to make a superficial, shallow film where basic elements of south american mentality are presented simply as side events, resulting in total incoherency. i can't believe there was a whole production team that could not understand the book! there is of course technical quality in this film and i think the actors did their best with what they had in their hands, but something is missing. and this something was the most important part.",1
"vampyres   aspect ratio: 1.85:1  sound format: mono  a motorist (murray brown) is lured to an isolated country house inhabited by two beautiful young women (marianne morris and anulka) and becomes enmeshed in their free-spirited sexual lifestyle, but his hosts turn out to be vampires with a frenzied lust for human blood...  taking its cue from the lesbian vampire cycle initiated by maverick director jean rollin in france, and consolidated by the success of hammer's ""carmilla"" series in the uk, jose ramon larraz' daring shocker vampyres pushed the concept of adult horror much further than british censors were prepared to tolerate in 1974, and his film was cut by almost three minutes on its original british release. it isn't difficult to see why! using its gothic theme as the pretext for as much nudity, sex and bloodshed as the film's short running time will allow, larraz (who wrote the screenplay under the pseudonym 'd. daubeney') uses these commercial elements as mere backdrop to a languid meditation on life, death and the impulses - sexual and otherwise - which affirm the human condition.  shot on location at a picturesque country house during the autumn of 1973, harry waxman's haunting cinematography conjures an atmosphere of grim foreboding, in which the desolate countryside - bleak and beautiful in equal measure - seems to foreshadow a whirlwind of impending horror (larraz pulled a similar trick earlier the same year with symptoms, a low-key thriller which erupts into a frenzy of violence during the final reel). however, despite its pretensions, vampyres' wafer-thin plot and rough-hewn production values will divide audiences from the outset, and while the two female protagonists are as charismatic and appealing as could be wished, the male lead (brown, past his prime at the time of filming) is woefully miscast in a role that should have gone to some beautiful twentysomething stud. a must-see item for cult movie fans, an amusing curio for everyone else, vampyres is an acquired taste. watch out for silent era superstar bessie love in a brief cameo at the end of the movie.",0
"those of you who, like me, were disappointed with the original 1995 horror yarn, ""the fear"" will find more to be disappointed with in this silly little sequel. it sort of follows a similar plot, but it is impossible to connect to the original, with the exception of the presence of morty, the mannequin monster made of wood. here is a brief overview.  twenty years after mike hawthorne (gordon currie, in a decent performance) witnesses his father brutally murder his mother and then take his own life, mike is still suffering from the fear of that day. in hopes of ridding his fear, mike takes his girlfriend and a bunch of friends up to his grandparents' home. his plan is for everyone to dress up in costumes that represent their fears, and then present the fears to the mannequin morty. according to an indian friend, this process is supposed to magically take away one's fear. what mike doesn't know is that morty is possessed with his father's spirit, and begins killing off the friends...or is it really mike himself doing the killings? who cares?  a have a few troubles with this film. the first lies with morty. i thought the original made morty look rather convincing. this time, it is painfully obvious morty is a man (actor jon fedele) in a fake looking suit. this can especially be seen in early scenes, where morty is still supposed to be inanimate, but if you watch closely you can see him blinking. another trouble is that most of the characters don't try hard enough. some of them do, namely betsy palmer, of friday the 13th fame, who was excellent in this film. but most of them don't make the effort or weren't given the chance. finally, there are the killings. the opening scenes involving ax murders were very convincing. actually, when i saw them i thought i was in for a good movie. when the second half of the movie arrives, and the killings really start, everything falls to pieces. deaths are either uncreative, unseen, or foreseen (glimpses of the next scene as currie has a blackout). one character dies in the end and no one, including the viewer, even notices. while more characterization was needed in the beginning half, it wasn't too bad. the second half was. i think new director chris angel got to this point and really didn't know how to shoot the violent scenes, so they turned out real sloppy and pedestrian. a silly ending doesn't help either. thus, unless you really loved the original and enjoy plucking splinters out from under your skin, you should probably skip ""the fear 2: halloween night."" zanatos' score: 4 out of 10.",0
"most college students find themselves lost in the bubble of academia, cut off from the communities in which they study and live. their conversations are held with their fellow students and the college faculty. steven greenstreet's documentary is a prime example of a disillusioned college student who judges the entire community based on limited contact with a small number of its members.  the documentary focused on a small group of individuals who were portrayed as representing large groups of the population. as is usual, the people who scream the most get the most media attention. other than its misrepresentation of the community in which the film was set, the documentary was well made. my only dispute is that the feelings and uproar depicted in the film were attributed to the entire community rather than the few individuals who expressed them.  naturally it is important to examine a controversy like this and make people aware of the differences that exist between political viewpoints, but it is ridiculous to implicate an entire community of people in the actions of a few radicals.",0
"i like fulci films, i really do and not in some boring ironic way either but i recognise that they appear hopelessly inept and garbled to lots of people.  conquest is where fulci tries his hand at the epic fantasy genre and doesn't really succeed. structurally, it's like most fulci films you've seen. some stuff happens, some more stuff happens and occasionally one scene might be tangentially related to another. really it's like conan with no sets, no script, no real actors (yes, arnold scharzenfartz is hardly an actor either), no budget, stupid looking dog soldiers and a bunch of gore.  this one was a hard one to get through and i could've lived without the inch of vaseline smeared on the camera to give it that hair metal music video look.",0
"bad acting, bad southern accents, inconsistent cinematography, horrible script...  i was looking forward to this film at a recent film festival and was so discouraged after seeing it. it contains quote/unquote name talent, but they do not deliver. of course the basis for this is the uneven and uninteresting story that is told.  don't bother",0
"this film plays in the 60s and is about an italian family: romano, his wife rosa and their two children gigi and giancarlo emigrate from solino in italy to duisburg in the ruhr area. i like this film, because i think it is quite realistic: it shows problems which many foreign families have when they come to another country: they have to get used to a new culture, a new environment and this can be difficult: especially if you don't know the language.... it is difficult for the family but they find a way: they open a restaurant which offers typical italian food, and it is named ""solino"", like their hometown. the film also shows different conflicts - gigi and giancarlo fall in love with the same girl, and although rosa has to work very hard, romano refuses to pay money to engage more workers, etc. etc. but stop, i don't want to tell you how it goes on. you should watch the film yourself, it's a nice one - i have also made a referat about it and examined scenes which show different cultural attitudes. and there are a few...",1
"as an ex-teacher(!) i must confess to cringing through many scenes - 'though i continued to watch to the end. i wonder why?!

"are you a giraffe?... ask john to nadia, and she, sure of responding well, responds him: yes. in this way begin the communication between a man and a woman who don't know each other, and at the same time, the questions and doubts in ""birthday girl"". a film that i heard a lot of times, but i don't dare to see... until two hours of write this.  ""birthday girl"" is a passionate movie that makes me fall in count, at the same time, that nicole kidman is one of the best actress (besides she is pretty and intelligent) that i have ever seen. ""birthday girl"" is the story of a lonely and routine man who looks for a wife at internet. the woman that he finds comes from russia. she seems to be that delicate woman, normal, not more. one day, in her birthday comes suddenly, his cousin and his friend. the man, begin to discover certain things. since here, he don't going to be the lonely and routine man that always have been.  much of us going to think that this movie is just a regular one with a exploited plot. much of us going to think that the action and thrills are sure and don't novel. but ""birthday girl"" is just the opposite. this movie is full of good surprises, good performances and a imaginative plot that i had never seen and imagined. this romantic thriller with certain funny touch is an excellent natural film with a lot of proposes for the films of it kind. ""birthday girl"" have certain beauty and crudeness in its scenes, but at the same time, certain touching nature, and makes it so deeper.

"for those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight, i first offer these four words: don't waste your time! ""chungking express"" was shoddily filmed, slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a hong kong burger king. i can't remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such one-dimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane! it's an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog (a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that ""tears can be dried with a tissue, but water takes time to mop up""). the same character is also seen carrying on a deep, meaningful rapport with his towels, soap, stuffed animals, dirty laundry, etc. the shaky, wandering, hand-held camera-work was another annoying feature i could have done without. and if that isn't enough to make you puke in your popcorn, we hear the old 60's ode ""california dreaming"" by the mamas and papas blaring over the soundtrack over and over again during a particularly lengthy sequence.  quentin tarantino was responsible for bringing this loser to america through his rolling thunder productions company, though i cannot for the life of me figure out why a man with his talent would bother. he was known to have remarked, ""i'm happy to love a movie this much."" a lot of us, though, hope he will concentrate on making his audiences happy with more worthwhile discoveries in the future.",0

"the first point that calls the attention in ""for ever mozart"" is the absence of a plot summary in imdb. the explanation is simple since there is no story, screenplay, plot or whatever might recall the minimum structure of a movie. jean-luc godard is one of the most overrated and pretentious directors of the cinema industry and this pointless crap is among his most hermetic films. i believe that neither himself has understood what is this story about; but there are intellectuals that elucubrate to justify or explain this messy movie, and it is funny to read their reviews.   my vote is one.  title (brazil): ""para sempre mozart"" (""forever mozart"")",0
"although i've long been a fan of peter weir, i hadn't watched any of his australian movies until i watched the last wave. and it was a pleasant, unpredictable surprise.  richard chamberlain plays david, a lawyer invited to defend five aborigines charged with murdering another aborigine. for david's peers it's a clear case of drunken disorder and they think they should plead guilty and serve a quick sentence. but david believes there's a mystery underneath the murder, linked to tribal rituals. as his investigation proceeds he learns not only things about his clients but about himself too.  to reveal more would be to spoil one of the strangest movies i've ever seen. i can only say that this movie goes in directions that no one will be expecting.  there are many elements that make this a fascinating movie: chamberlain's acting, for instance; but also the performances by david gulpilil, who plays a young aborigine who introduces david into tribal mysteries; and nandjiwarra amagula, who plays an old aborigine who's a spiritual guide. the relationships between these three characters make the heart of the movie.  but there's also the way weir suggests the supernatural in the movie. david has dreams that warn him of the future. australia is undergoing awful weather, with storms, hail falling and even a mysterious black rain that may be nothing more than pollution. but it's also related to the case david is defending. how it's related is one of the great revelations of the movie. out of little events weir manages to create an atmosphere of dread and oppression, suggesting future horrors without really showing anything.  charles wain's score is fantastic, especially the use of the didgeridoo. the photography is also quite good. russell boyd, weir's longtime dp who won an oscar in 2004 for master and commander, depicts a dark, creepy world full of mystery.  i also find it remarkable that for a movie centered on aborigines, it doesn't turn into an indictment against white culture or into a sappy celebration of the their traditions, like dances with wolves or the last samurai. this movie is too clever to be that simplistic.  sometimes it can be frustrating, and it may upset viewers who expect to finish a movie with everything making sense; but for those who don't mind some strangeness or ambiguity, the last wave is a great movie to watch.",1
"like many here i grew up with scooby-doo. unlike many here who did, i love this show! i think that it has been very well done and thought through. everything about it marks it as a spin-off which isn't meant to be taken seriously. the formula is simple - it is a parody of other cartoons with a single bad guy trying to get the better of the good guy. by using the well known shaggy and scooby-doo characters it is much easier to engage the viewer with the parody humour from the outset of each 30 minute episode.  there have always been scooby-doo spin-offs which have annoyed fans. the classic being the scooby-shaggy-scrappy shorts from the 80's. these spin-offs had their place: they allowed new content to be sold, created new fans, and kept scooby-doo merchandise on the shelves. i would agree that ""shaggy & scooby-doo: get a clue!"" doesn't fit in with this traditional role but it is probably what i had always wanted the scooby-shaggy-scrappy shorts to be: an action packed show which focuses on the best/funniest scooby-doo characters! good features of the show: the animation, the voices, the attention to detail, the bad-guys, the ""best friend"" relationship between shaggy and scooby-doo, the constant humour! bad features: none, although the revamped mystery machine is pretty close at times.  well done warner bros. animation! one of the cleverest cartoons in a long time!",1
"i have a severe problem with this show, several actually. a simple list will suffice for now, i'll go into more depth later on: superficial characters, a laugh-track and boring humour.  if you don't wish to look at the rest of this review and are only reading it so you can feel superior (as if you see anything in this show i didn't) to a frequently irked teen from canada i'll summarize: friends sucks, not only because it is unfunny but because it destroyed the tv audiences for new, good shows (arrested development, dexter etc.). friends is as much to blame for reality tv, ""two and a half men"" and ""the king of queens"" as the television executives. now then, on with the review.  these characters have no soul, they are exactly the same in every way (outside of gender and hair colour). they react the same way in boring situations and are completely secure in their own bodies. where is the conflict and the humour that comes with it? why isn't rachel storming out on monica after monica starts hanging out with rachel's enemy? why doesn't joey contemplate suicide because nobody seems to take him seriously? oh right, cause he's the dumb one and he's comfortable with that. this is the curse of having perfect characters: lasting conflict and (god forbid) personality becomes an impossibility.  the laugh-track is the one thing that should have died out right after it was born. any show that has one is almost certainly the opposite of funny. how can i make such a broad generalization? when a show that claims to be ""comedy"" requires laughter from someone besides the audience it must mean that the audience would not laugh without it. laughtracks destroy humour by preventing quick comebacks. humour becomes a construct rather than a free flowing entity (see the office, arrested development).  this leads to my next point: the humour is boring. there is no way to make a perfect character anything more than slightly humorous (without a laugh-track apparently) simply because our everyday humour comes from recognition of our flaws. so what if monica dated a 17 year old? she immediately recognizes that what she is doing isn't right and breaks up with him. there has to be some sort of conflict rather than an immediate solution. maybe her mother finds out or one of her friends tries to get rid of him and ends up seducing him. that would be great, it would be like a custody battle! so now i've provided evidence for my position. many of my friends love this show because they haven't heard of curb your enthusiasm or arrested development, many of my friends hate this show because they recently started watching curb your enthusiasm or arrested development.   i have watched very little of ""friends"" in my life, but i have watched enough to spot huge flaws that make the show, in my opinion, completely unwatchable. if you've read this far, thank you, and i hope you at least start watching some of the shows i have mentioned.",0
"this movie was well done in all respects. the acting is superb along with the fine audio soundtrack which i purchased because it was so moving. it is my all time favorite movie ahead of eastwoods ""white hunter,black heart"". this movie is simply the best.  cheers zuf",1
"a number of richard attenborough's films as director have been biographies of major historical figures- ""young winston"", ""gandhi"", ""chaplin"". ""grey owl"" is also a filmed biography of a historical individual, but in this case attenborough's subject is a much more obscure character.  grey owl was a canadian writer of the 1920s and 1930s who promoted the ideas of environmentalism and nature conservation at a time when these causes were less fashionable than they are today. he was widely believed to be an american indian; the story he told about himself was that he had been born in mexico to a scottish father and apache mother and had emigrated to canada where he had been adopted as a member of the ojibway tribe. he lived in a cabin by a lake in a remote part of the canadian wilderness, where he earned a living as a trapper. he toured britain twice, in 1935 and 1937, to promote his books and to give lectures on conservationism, and achieved great success, even being introduced to the royal family. (during one of these tours attenborough, then a teenager, saw grey owl at the london palladium theatre). after his death in 1938, however, it was revealed that he had not been who he claimed to be; his real name was archibald belaney, and he had been born in the english seaside town of hastings.  the film departs somewhat from the facts of grey owl's life. in a scene set in 1934 he states that he is 41 years old; in reality, he was born in 1888 so would have been 46 in that year. (46 would have been pierce brosnan's age when the film was made, so i am not sure why this change was made). numerous events are compressed into the last four years of grey owl's life (1934-1938). in the film it is during this period that he meets and marries gertrude bernard whom he called anahareo; in reality, he met and married gertrude as early as 1925. the film also omits the fact that they were divorced in 1936 and that grey owl remarried shortly before his death.  the revelation of grey owl's true identity adversely affected his posthumous reputation, and he was dismissed as a ""fraud"". his supposed deceit was even used to discredit the causes which he had championed. richard attenborough, however, takes a more sympathetic view of his achievements. one of the themes explored by the film is the question of ethnic identity. although the erstwhile archibald belaney was not a canadian indian by birth, there is no doubt that he had a deep knowledge of ojibway culture and lore and that he spoke their language fluently. he was accepted by the ojibway as a member of their tribe. it therefore seems unfair to describe his claim to a native north american identity as being a fraudulent one, merely because it was an identity he had chosen rather than one he had been born into.  according to the film, grey owl's wife gertrude was herself of indian descent, but came from a family which had been assimilated into white canadian culture. her marriage can therefore be seen as her reclamation of her family's original cultural heritage. she was clearly influenced by her husband, but she also had an influence on him, persuading him to give up his work as a fur trapper as she had moral objections to killing animals for their fur.  one criticism made of the film is that pierce brosnan is ""miscast"" as the hero, a criticism which seems to be rooted in the preconception that brosnan can only play action heroes in the james bond mould. it seems to me, however, that brosnan may deliberately have taken this role in order to avoid being typecast, the taciturn backwoodsman grey owl being about as far from the suave, sophisticated agent bond as one can get. the original bond, sean connery, also seems to have deliberately opted for contrasting roles when he appeared in films like ""the hill"" or ""the molly maguires"". brosnan is in fact very good in this role, although i would agree with those who found annie galipeau weak as gertrude.  another frequently-voiced criticism with which i would not agree is that the film is ""boring"". certainly, it is not an action film like the bonds, nor is it a great epic biopic like ""gandhi"", and it may indeed seem boring to those who were expecting it to be either the one or the other. it is however, likely to please anyone with an interest in the early days of the conservationist movement or the philosophical implications of national and ethnic identity. the scenes of the canadian forests are also beautifully photographed. richard attenborough has done us a service by helping to revive interest in this half-forgotten but fascinating figure. 7/10",1

"i don't know about you, but what i love about tom and jerry cartoons is the (often violent) interaction between the two characters. mouse in manhattan sees jerry leaving tom behind to have an adventure in new york, and as far as i am concerned, this one definitely suffers from a lack of cat!  as magical as jerry's exploration of the 'big apple' might be for the other t&j fans who have commented here on imdb, i couldn't wait for this self-indulgent rubbish to end, so i could watch the next cartoon on my dvd.  in fact, the only part of the whole episode that i genuinely enjoyed was when jerry almost 'buys the farm', hanging precariously off the end of a broken candle, hundreds of feet above a busy road.",0
"  however, the ladies of all ages will lap it up, no doubt; at least the opposite sex understand what it is to be a mother, and most of us men try to fathom out what it is to be a father. whether changing nappies is not at all my favourite occupation and trying to get those bottled baby-foodstuffs into errant toothless mouths must rank very high on household duties preferably left to its mother, has absolutely nothing to do with the matter.  some good interpretations here, and a good story idea; the handling of the matter, limited to rather scanty tv-production concepts, gives the film a rather over-mellowy taste with not much new to offer. an insipid way of delivering the goods, and in the end the outcome is so forseeable during the last 20 minutes or so, even my wife dozed off, and i was jumping up to the computer to get the on-line scoring in the barcelona-deportivo match, hoping the away team would do something rather good. they did. this film did not.  better by far is mike leigh's magnificent ""secrets and lies"" (qv) which touches on the same subject matter, but with brenda blethyn playing a far superior part.",0
"disney, the film name that once stood for all things innocent and suitable for all ages, has finally started to realise that to survive it needs to become more diverse. such diversity has been very apparent in the last couple of years. films like ""tarzan"" and ""the emperor's new groove"" have made an attempt to move away from the traditional song-driven routine of disney's past and into new, uncharted territory. ""atlantis"" is the boldest step yet, but we have to remember: this is still disney. the first ever serious film to come out of disney's animation studio is a major achievement for them - in fact it's so serious it makes it into pg territory. perhaps why a lot of families were scared off from seeing it this past summer.  but despite the more mature subject matter, this is still a film that disney wanted to draw in the families with, not just mature audiences, so the plot had to be kept simple enough for children to understand, but interesting enough to take it away from the realms of ""the little mermaid"" et al.  so what we get is actually a potentially detailed plot, unfortunately suffering the blow of being condensed into a 96-minute movie. ultimately, this is an action film about atlantis, not about the exposition preceding it, so we are whisked through the first half hour with as many sequences bombarding the screen as is possible without losing coherency. suspend your disbelief of how the characters get from point a to point b so quickly, you're unlikely to find an animated film that detailed coming out of hollywood! if you want epic levels of detail in the plot, turn to james cameron's ""titanic"". both films feature a boat in some manner.  and let's talk about love, shall we? yes, as with a lot of films, the lead male (one milo thatch, a bumbling archaeologist) and lead female (kida, the clichéd atlantian princess) are set to fall in love with each other. but what i found was not as clichéd as i was expecting. by film's end, for once, the characters touching/feeling/kissing sequence was far more subdued. there's various points in the film where the attraction grows, but it's just not in the ballpark of, say, ""the little mermaid"" (a good thing).  you may have grasped that this is a rather clichéd film. correct. you have your leading hero and heroine, backed up by more than half a dozen crew members who go on the expedition, all being given their moments during the film. numerous other characters appear, take up the few minutes of screentime, then disappear. it doesn't take a genius to do the maths  a 96-minute film with a focus on action and visuals, and with a considerable cast, has very little time to expand the characters to any major extent. so what does it rely on? clichés, and lots of them. every character emulates something that has been done a thousand times before. you have the bumbling scientist, the attractive princess, the square-jawed colonel, the rich eccentric, the maniacal sleazebag, the russian femme fatale  need i go on?  i don't know why this got to anyone  i found the tongue-in-cheek nature of this film quite amusing. alright, this is meant to be a serious flick, but do you really expect disney to give up every single trait of their history? at least the writers have tried to come up with consistently witty dialogue, and sometimes it even is a little inspired.  but in the end it's those big stunning visuals that put the icing on this cake. the cgi animation is truly amazing in places, and doesn't dwarf the characters, which was a flaw that let the recent ""titan a.e."" down. speaking of characters, disney hired an outside comics industry artist to create the designs, bringing an anime style to the film. infact the visual presentation of the film as a whole owes a lot to anime, much more so than any previous disney outing. this resulted in a conflict with fans of the japanese anime, ""nadia"", for the film's overall similarities with said cartoon series. having not seen this anime, i can't comment.  with picture, there is sound. gary rydstrom heads up the sound team, and what a soundtrack! from the opening shot the sound stage is alive and is a treat. james newton howard treats us to a dynamic musical score, which compliments the film in every way, never sounding out of place and always helping to build the tension or subdue it.  perhaps i missed the point of what the creators intended. to me, the film conveys that it's an adventure thrill ride, albeit with a more serious tone than any disney film before it. if you don't like the clichéd tongue-in-cheek attitude, then perhaps the effort that has been poured into the visuals will delight. heck, at least the mythology is far more correct than can be said about other disney efforts (*cough*hercules*cough*).  this is a positive, 10 out of 10 review, from someone who was blown away by this film. i always suspend my disbelief with any animated film  after all, the laws of the real world are more than frequently broken in the cartoon medium. so sit back, enjoy the ride, and perhaps everyone can find something to enjoy about this film.",1
"i was too young to remmeber when i first saw this movie. but i saw it for like the second time about 7 years ago. my sister told me i had to see it. now my whole family has it memorized. we quote it at least once a day. i absolutly love this movie.i still laugh after all this time. sure, it's about a really, really drunk millionare that is irresponsible. the whole point is that he still has the humanity lost in the others that we see in the movie. and that he is willing to give it all up for love. i highly recomend this movie to anyone who wants a laugh. a lot of laughs. its hallarious, sweet, and if your a movie buff, it will truely change your idea of ""funny"". watch it with a group of your friends or your family and i promise, you will never have nothing to talk about ever again with some authur lines in your head. it will make you laugh for years to come.  it is really hard, in my family, to find a movie that everyone likes. but this movie, i feel, made us closer. and i know it will do the same for you!!",1
"definitely one of the lesser of the astaire/rogers musicals. it's just very poorly plotted and paced. it only runs a few minutes longer than swing time, for example, but it feels a heck of a lot longer. this is partly due to the secondary romance between randolph scott and harriet hilliard. scott is rarely ever interesting. i like hilliard. she's sweet, and i love at least one of her songs, ""but where are you?"" (""get thee behind me satan"", her other number, is a weak leftover from top hat, thankfully cut from that masterpiece). follow the fleet would actually be a bad film if not for at least three brilliant dance sequences between astaire and rogers. the dancing contest vies for the top spot of any of their numbers. the dance is just fantastic. ""i'm putting all my eggs in one basket"" presents the two rehearsing a dance that they don't quite have perfected yet. its imperfections make it all the more perfect. and ""let's face the music and dance"" is easily one of irving berlin's best songs. so the film is well worth watching for its great moments.",1
"truly bad and easily the worst episode i have ever seen....ever.  they tried to make up for it by giving it the, 'we know we are doing this' routine. that would have been funny if it weren't for the fact that 'the simpsons' had already done it. and it still wouldn't make up for it if they had come up with the idea in the first place.  the flashbacks took place as part of the usual character's (mainly j.d's) fantasies. the flashbacks weren't even of actual events that occurred, just compilations of say, j.d falling over or, i don't know.... elliott falling over. if i wanted to watch a scrubs compilation i'd go on youtube and not waste half an hour of my life.  scrubs has ultimately fallen into the trap that most sit-coms have to, and it disappoints me, they managed to go 5 and a quarter seasons without an episode like this.   i was hoping that scrubs wouldn't have to be that kind of sit-com.  and just as a passing thought, why the hell was dr.cox bald?",0

""steve?"" ""steve, is that you?"" ""steve, i'm not kidding"" ""steve, this isn't funny!"" ""steve, are you there?"" ""steve?"" ""steve?"" ""steve?""  ""arggh!!!! ahhhhhh!!!! nooooooo!""",0
"set in the 70s, ""seed"" centers around convicted serial killer max seed (will sanderson), who killed 666 people in 6 years. he is sentenced to death, but in the electric chair he doesn't die, even after being shocked three times.  detective matt bishop (michael paré) and other officers cover up this secret by burying seed alive. seed breaks out and goes after the people who put him in his living coffin.  filmed by the worst director in the world (uwe boll), ""seed"" is nothing more than a snuff film about trying to stretch the envelope of decent society and fails to deliver in any aspect of a storyline. and he said this is based on true events because if a person survives the electric chair after being shocked three times, they will be set free. this is an urban legend, and it would never happen. much like boll's other abominations (""alone in the dark"" for one), ""seed"" is just utterly horrendous.",0
"i really enjoyed the pilot, it was as amazing as i hoped it would be, if not better. patrick warburton was a riot, although at first i thought that i wouldn't be able to stand his character. him and megyn price had little chemistry at all, but hopefully as the season goes on they'll get more comfortable around each other. it must have been weird for megyn to go from being the star on her last show [""grounded for life""] to being a co-star.   bianca kajlich and oliver hudson seem really new to the whole sitcom scene, but i think in time they'll get better. david spade's character, to my surprise, wasn't the whole focus of this pilot. the way he delivers his lines is so different from anyone else i've ever seen on tv, but i think that it is just his style. it works for him.  i think that couples, or even singles, will be able to relate to all the doubts and fights and being unsure about your decisions, that this show is about. all the situations that the characters are put in just feel like real life, not sugar-coated like most shows.  i hope for all the actors sakes that cbs gives them a chance. this show has the potential to be one of the best series, if just given the chance and time.",1
"i happened to watch this movie by chance some days ago while flipping channels. my expectations were not very high but it was an interesting movie.in 'a guy thing', jason lee plays paul, a straight-laced, seattle-based fellow who is about to marry his fiancée karen (selma blair) and settle down to an unchallenging life of middle-class domesticity. we first meet paul at his bachelor party, where he professes no desire to engage in any of the normal bachelor party type activities his (surprisingly few) buddies encourage, in case he's a bit naughty and gets into hot bother with his soon to be trouble and strife. of course, the next thing paul knows, it's the morning after the night before, he's in bed with a naked hula dancer, and his mother-in-law phones to inform him that karen is on her way over. oh, and the hula dancer is karen's cousin becky (julia stiles).  from this small acorn of potential trouble grows a mighty oak of frenetic misfortune, as paul scrabbles from misadventure to misadventure, trying to cover up what he's done whilst keeping up the appearance of being a dutiful, family-oriented good guy, who's super-excited about his forthcoming nuptials. his efforts to ensure karen remains none the wiser about any potential wrong-doing on his part ironically forces paul closer and closer to the fun-loving becky, forcing him to question whether he really wants the life that seems to have been mapped out for him. the movie contains the right mix of comedy and romance. definitely worth a watch.",1

"well, i'll start by admitting i'm not a john ford fan. (i watched ""the informer"" only because i'm trying to work my way through a list of the ""greats."") so if you are, just move along, 'cause you're not going to agree with me.  what an overwrought and dated piece of silliness this is! i will say that there is a good idea for a movie here (it made me think about how few films there are about the irish revolution) but, as usual, ford is determined to bury it under over-acting and cheap sentiment. i suppose it's somewhat interesting to watch for a while in order to see the less-than-seamless transition that was being made from the silents to the ""talkies"" -- the acting styles of some of the principals have that overbroad quality endemic to early films and movie does feel as if it might play better with title cards than spoken dialogue. (of course, title cards would prevent ford from restating every bit of emotion six times.) what dialogue there is usually has a ""they're always after me lucky charms!"" quality that is aggravated by the fact that each actor seems to have been allowed to use his or her own personal version of an irish accent. of course, as bad as they are, the accents are helpful in reminding us we're in ireland because the sets mostly look as if they were dragged in from from some german expressionist piece being filmed on the next soundstage over. (it feels as if, with an eagle eye, you might see some villagers off to torch dr. frankenstein in the background.)  techniques change. tastes change. so i won't go off on how crazy it seems that this film was so acclaimed in its day. but it's not one of the classics that hold up --- more just ""fair warning"" about the kind of over-simplified malarkey to which ford was going to devote his career.",0
"great western i hear you all say! brilliant first effort! well i'm not sure what film you all watched but it must have been a different one to the one i saw. great westerns or indeed good films of any genre have characters you can believe in and this film had none! the acting was poor to say the least and i couldn't care less about any of the characters, making the whole film pointless. the story was too big for the makers and perhaps they should try their hand at making straight to tv low budget rubbish like you see on those ""fact or fiction"" programmes on sci-fi.  please, if you are looking for a good film, a great western or even just an enjoyable hour and a half, please look elsewhere.",0
"de grot is a very good film. the great plot comes from the novel by tim krabbé, who also adapted this story for the screen. some really top-class acting, not only by van huêt, but especially by marcel hensema, who mostly did tv-work prior to his performance of axel van de graaf. the film seems to kick of as a thriller, and sets an excellent mood. then we start to learn about egon wagter and axel van de graaf, and the story is revealed bit by bit in a very compelling flash-back structure, which adds to the more romantic aspect and the character-driven drama of the movie. in the end this all culminates into an emotional ending, that will grab audiences by their throats. make sure you know as little as possible about the plot when you are going to see this movie. a must-see, especially if you liked 'spoorloos' (the vanishing's original screen adaptation).",1
"""house of games"" is a flawlessly constructed film, and one of the few films i have seen that had me gaping at the screen in astonishment at how cleverly and unexpectedly it ends. i first saw it on video a few years back after reading roger ebert's review, which proclaimed it the best film of 1987. i had my doubts, mainly because it is not quite as well known as other films from that year. boy, was i in for a surprise. this was one of the smartest, most well-written movies i had ever seen.  the screenplay is quite a piece of work, not only in terms of the plot (which twists and turns and pulls the rug out from under you just when you think you have it all figured out), but also in terms of character development. on my second viewing, i began to realize that mamet's screenplay succeeds not only as a clever suspense film, but that each plot development contributes to our understanding of the characters and their motivations. the climax of the movie is particularly effective, because it is absolutely inevitable. it stems naturally from what we know about the characters, and it is therefore much more than just an arbitrary twist ending. the performances by lindsay crouse and joe mantegna also add enormously to the film. i cannot picture any other actor besides mantegna playing the role of mike, and crouse plays her role with just the right amount of restraint to suggest a repressed criminal mindset. their work, plus mamet's extraordinary screenplay, combine to create one of the greatest films of the 1980's. it is truly a must-see.",1
"i know i know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome. i love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time i was impressed with darth vader turning against the emperor i really stayed astonished. the anguishing sequence in that film was when luke is tortured and defeated by the emperor/darth sidious. he is about to be destroyed when darth vader, dark lord of the sith, eliminates his dark master. a nice sacrifice. the cinematography of this film is impressive. i was surprised with all the vessels of the rebel battle ships and all imperial war ships and super star destroyers. i loved the new race they brought on screen the mon calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (lando's co pilot) and many more... most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-when vader destroys the emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- when luke sees the spirits of obi-wan and yoda and then it shows up anakin skywalker (sebastian shaw)(the greatest scene in star wars) 3- when leia slays jabba strangling the hutt crime lord.  i personally like the script and the battle of endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of star wars between darth vader v.s luke skywalker on the death star. post-script: the scenes with leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10.",1
"this movie provided nothing new or worthwhile. after seeing it, my wife and i both agreed that the studio simply churned this out and could have cared less if it was entertaining. this is a good example of a ""concept only"" film--they have a concept about a film and the other details are unimportant because execs know it will make $$ just based on the initial concept.  the movie starts with cruella getting out of prison and going on parole. she no longer hates puppies but has been programmed to adore them--she simply couldn't hurt a flea. this doesn't last too long after her release and she's back to her old ways. period.  the most annoying aspects of the movie were the supporting characters. eric idle as the voice of waddlesworth the bird made me hate him--and that is tough considering i am a die-hard python fan. it was obvious he did this because they gave him lots of money (there can't be any other reason). cruella's low self-esteem servant, tim mcinnerny, was funny in the black adder shows but here he is totally wasted and unfunny. and it must have cost a few bucks to get gérard depardieu but he was utterly wasted as well. there were some other supporting actors as well but given how poorly written the characters were, i am trying to block them out of my mind.  overall, you'd be better just to let your kids watch television than bother letting them see this drivel.",0
"i loved this movie. i totally disagree with some (negative) critiques that i've read over the years. this was a great vehicle for eddie murphy! he appeared to have a great time with his part as chandler jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say, if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it! and, it was fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with mr. murphy's great comedic style. you have to keep in mind that 'golden child' is a 'fantasy' film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the 'real' world. during the time this film was released, i was working in a video rental store. this was one of the most popular with all our customers. every single time, we put this one up on our monitor, all the copies we had went out fast with wait-list requests that kept it on the queue for months! everyone who rented it loved it! i was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and i knew the taste of my customers so i highly recommended this one to most of them. i really feel that this film is a sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later! (yes, i did buy this film for my own video library!). i adored the little boy who played the 'golden child'  j. l. reate - but after looking at his profile in imdb, i noticed that he never did any more films. that is sad, because he definitely had an on-screen aura and could have continued with a film career. i also adored victor wong, who played the old man (i loved him in his part as 'egg shen' in 'big trouble in little china' - 1986). at any rate, this was a great film. the only drawbacks that didn't seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more 'adult' in nature  such as 'chandler's rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette. it was funny, but it still was out of sync. ok, so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mind-set of the day perhaps. this was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from hollywood. now that's entertainment!",1
"this film is massively boring and pretentious. there is only one good moment when a sailor shaves mr barney's(think the purple dinosaur-less pretense) eyebrow. the music is relentlessly cloying-it is sad that bjork, someone with so much inner beauty, has been brought down to pretentious falsity in her art. the pomp of the tea service makes a beautiful ritual seem vapid. the mythology and culture are not respected in this film they are lifted. not just from japanese culture but from another filmmaker...(stay tuned) in a perfect ""art imitates life"" moment-the crew of the ship finds a giant piece of sh*t. which is what the audience found in the theatre. there are some set pieces which are very composed and arty without heart---thenprepare for spoilers-i'm talking to you mr barney.  the emperor has no clothes! mr. barney you have been outted! i have seen jodorowsky's holy mountain. and your thin, fake veil of bs has been lifted. you have stolen your images your style and your entire art catalogue from this man. now that holy mountain has been released finally let's hope the powers that be at the art councils of the world stop financing you! poor jodorowsky-lost in a financial battle with the beatles lawyer when he is the lennon/mccartney of film-making. and btw while jodorowsky is the beatle-you are the monkees! a cheap thin soulless rip off only liked by facile kitschy college freshmen. and btw i am a filmmaker. if you are interested in making a reality film-i will legally fight you in a ring defending jodorowsky-you, defending outright thievery.",0
"the five deadly venoms is easily the most memorable k.f. flick from the shaw brothers' stable (exc. maybe master killer). it has the artists who came to be known as simply ""the venoms"", some of the best fight choreography ever, and, surprisingly for a kung fu movie, a great plot! one of my all-time favorites!!!",1
"running man isn't a great movie, in fact it's kinda silly. but it delivers what you want in an arnie movie and that is action and entertainment. i don't see how anyone couldn't enjoy this picture, it's so silly and over the top, that it almost makes fun of itself. by the way, this is probably one of the most quotable arnie movies out there.",1
"okay. this movie is a pure pleasure. it has the ever so violent horror mixed with a little suspense and a lot of black comedy. the dentist really starts to loose his mind and it's enjoyable to watch him do so. this movie is for certain people, though. either you'll completely love it or you will totally hate it. a good movie to rent and watch when you don't got anything else to do. also recommended: psycho iii",1
"this is one of the oddest films of the zatôichi series due to its very unusual pacing and the role that ichi plays in the film. interestingly enough, this was the first zatôichi film made by shintaro katsu's new production company. now, instead of just playing the blind swordsman, katsu is in charge of making the films. this could easily explain why this film seems so different in style to the previous 15 films. as far as ichi's role, the film is very different because he isn't in the film as much as usual. he's also easy to fool and actually, for a while, does a lot to harm people instead of helping!   ""zatôichi rôyaburi"" begins with ichi talking with an old lady who tries to take advantage of his blindness. oddly, in this scene, ichi says that he's been blind since a toddler, though in an earlier film he says his blindness set in when he was 8. this is a minor mistake, and only a crazed fan like myself would have noticed.  this film takes place over a period of at least six months and is more likely to have taken a year--so you can see what i said about odd pacing. most films in the series take place over a few days or weeks. ichi comes to a town where there is a boss (asagoro) who tries very hard to be nice to ichi because he knows of the blind man's reputation. the boss is quite charming and surprisingly ichi is totally taken in by the evil man. at the same time, he meets another boss (shushui)--a sort of guru to the poor. shushui admonishes the people to forsake all violence and even ichi falls under his teaching--giving up his blade for many months. shushui's teachings are very similar to daoist teachings from china--non-violence and acceptance of life as it is (for good or for bad).   months after leaving this town and thinking all was well, ichi learns that as soon as he left, asagoro showed his true colors--enslaving women, oppressing the poor and being an all-around jerk. in a way, ichi is responsible for this, as he helped asagoro and counted him as a friend. now, asagoro has captured shushui and several innocent people have killed themselves due to the evil boss' actions.  when ichi returns, he doesn't accept automatically that asagoro is good or evil but tests him cleverly. this bit with a scarecrow is inspired and leads to a finale where, what else, ichi kills the baddies and frees shushui. this finale was very good and occurred in the rain. then final scene with asagoro and the rocks is great, though the beheading is a tad cheesy by today's special effects standards.  pluses for the film are that although poorly paced, it is different and cannot be mistaken for the previous 15 (which often seem very similar). additionally, it does end very well. minuses (aside from pacing) are that some might dislike seeing ichi so fallible and the scenes with ichi and the other blind men that are included for comic relief fall flat...very, very, very flat. they are tacky and unfunny...that's the sort of flat that it is.",1
"all dogs go to heaven is one of the best movies i've ever seen. i first saw it when i was like 3. now i'm 12 and i rented it, it makes me think of things and it brings back so many memories, those were ""the days"". i love the music, i love when charlie is arriving in heaven, i love the song ""let me be surprised"". i love how charlie looks and his voice, bert reynolds could only play charlie's voice this great. i love this movie, the 1st one is the best one because it's so original and great. it really does bring back memories that no one can describe, not even me. if only i could go back to those days. i love the characters. if this is the way the memories come back when i'm 12 imagine how i'll feel when i'm like 19, i hope i'll be able to watch this when i'm older. when i first seen this i never knew that i would really look back on it and feel this way , i hope it will be available to watch. i'm so happy that this movie was made and the amazing idea came to mind and heart. on a scale from 1-10 i'd give it a perfect 10. it's an amazing movie. it's so hard to explain the feeling, when i get older and if i have kids, i hope they can experience this feeling.",1
"i personally liked ""the prophecy"" of 1995 a lot. christopher walken was, as always, great, and even though the film wasn't flawless, it was a creepy and highly original horror/fantasy film that entertained immensely. this inferior 1998 sequel is still worth watching, but mainly due to walken. walken is one of the greatest actors around, in my opinion, and he is once again outstanding in the role of the fallen archangel gabriel, whom he plays for the second time here. once again, the war between fallen and loyal angels is brought to earth. gabriel returns in order to prevent the birth of a child, namely the child of the angel danyael (russel wong) and the human woman valerie (jennifer beals). this child could once be the determining factor of the celestial war... as i said above, christopher walken is once again excellent as gabriel. besides gabriel, however, ""the prophecy ii"" sadly also includes a bunch of terribly annoying characters. the character of valerie was annoying enough, and danayel annoyed me even more. the biggest pain in the ass, however was the character of izzy (played by brittany murphy), a suicidal girl who wouldn't shut up. still, walken's performance isn't the only redeeming quality of the film. the entire film is quite dreary, and well-shot in dark colors, which contributes a lot to the atmosphere. gabriel's resurrection scene in the beginning is furthermore quite impressive, and one of the coolest moments in any of the ""prophecy"" films. ""the prophecy ii"" is nevertheless the weakest of the three ""prophecy"" films with walken. definitely a christopher walken one-man-show, entertaining, but nothing beyond that.",0
"this movie makes a statement about joseph smith, what he stood for, and what the lds church believes. with all the current media coverage of a certain fugitive people have confused the lds church with the flds church and criminal fugitive warren jeffs. jeffs is not associated with the lds church yet media groups internationally have asked for comments about jeffs from the lds church. jeffs is not mentioned in the movie at all but i think that it is ironic that this movie with all it's points about joseph also point away from the fews of the flds church and their leader at this time in the media world. this is a movie about joseph smith and a great one at that. some of the most obvious differences between jeffs and joseph is portrayed in joseph's humanity, acceptance and love. jeffs views and opinions differ greatly from joseph smith and the lds church and it is seen in this movie. jeffs thinks of the ""negro"" as devils. joseph smith knew they were children of god and gave up his wife's favorite horse to a african american (former slave) to buy his son's freedom. joseph is shown doing housework for his wife emma and is criticized by a member until joseph tells him that a man may lose his wife in the next life if she chooses not to stay with her husband and that doing chores is a way to help and cherish your wife. jeffs brought one of his polygamist wives to her knees in front of a class full of students by grabbing her braid and twisting it painfully till she came to her knees. lastly joseph participated with law enforcement and sought aid from the government at all times. jeffs thumbs his nose at government and flees at all times.  i loved this movie and if you don't know much about joseph smith and what the lds church believes, then this is the movie to see. and if you had confused the lds church with the flds church then you really need to get your act together. we are not much different from anyone who believes in jesus christ, the sanctity of marriage and the family, as well a patriotic to our homeland and country. we are all different as well just like you can find different protestants, presbyterians, methodist, baptist and catholics. what's important is our message and what we stand for. this movie trys to portray that but there is so much of joseph's life that can't be covered in a mere 2 hour movie. this was a really great show.",1
"a super, unusual film from audiard, read my lips is a pulpy, lonely- hearts thriller. it's perfect for the handsomely grizzled charisma of vincent cassel and features a marvellously contained performance from emanuelle devos. devos is a recurring feature of audiard in the same way that karin viard pops up for jean-pierre jeunet: unconventionally beautiful (she's referred to by everyone as unattractive in this film), versatile and capable of a subordinate profile.  this is almost the definition of her role as carla, a put-upon office dogsbody, taunted by colleagues exploiting her deafness. yet she finds an ami d'exploitation, if you like in cassel's ex-con paul. each exploits the other's unconventional talents (theft and lip reading) to struggle through their respective situations and form an unconventionally romantic rapprochement. devos/audiard manage carla's deafness and its attendant, warped inner world with discreet, stylish flair.  in this film (2001) audiard is already clearly in control of his handling on tension, action and investing his frame with a truly visceral experience which will become the great hit - a prophet - of nine years later. 7/10",1
"why did i waste my money on this on the last day of sundance? i want a refund... can i have my $16 back? while i was watching this film i kept waiting for something to happen, nothing did happen. the only way i even knew what it was supposed to be about was by reading the plot, which was not really like the film. why did the director zoom in with their handy cam and then zoom out? it was not very artistic. why did the director show lulu filing her nails for fifteen minutes? why is it when the actors tried to speak they sounded like they were reading? or was that the point? i felt like phantom love had no story at all, and to be honest i felt like my friends vacation videos had a much higher entertainment value than this film.",0
"i rented this movie because i was browsing through the horror movie section for those movies that no one's heard of and could be a possible gem. i saw this and, since i'm a fan of violence and gore, i got it. it got the rating of em which means: extremely mature. thinking that this rare and high rating was totally meant for violence and everything else, i got it. the warning on the box said: extreme violence, extreme langauge, and nudity. the ""extreme violence"" struck my fancy. the movie ended being a pretty tame slasher flick. it had one or two gory scenes but i've seen worse in a pg-13 movie. of course the amount of gore in a movie isn't all that counts, right? you have plot also. well, the plot was boring and there nothing really special about it. don't rent it. i speak the truth. i can't imagine how someone could really enjoy it to the point where they say: ""i'm gonna rent that again."" it had it's moments where it kept you going but i'm never going to see that film again.",0
"armageddon ppv  the last ppv of 2006  smackdown brand.  match results ahead********  we are starting the show with the inferno match. kane v. mvp. this was an okay match. nothing about wrestling here. this was about the visuals. overall, this was not bad. there were a few close spots here with kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end, kane won with ramming mvp into the fire back first.  nice opener. let's continue.  teddy long announces a new match for the tag team titles: london and kendrick will defend against: regal and taylor, the hardyz, and mnm in a ladder match!!!! let's get moving!  match two: fatal four way ladder match. this was total carnage. judging by three out of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. the spots were amazing. a total spot-fest. one point jeff went for poetry in motion and london moved and jeff hit the ladder! shortly afterword, jeff is set on the top rope with two ladders nearby as mnm were going to kill jeff, matt makes the save and jeff hits the ""see-saw"" shot to joey mercury! mercury is hurt. his eye is shut quickly and is busted open hard way. mercury is taken out of the match and nitro is still there. he is going to fight alone for the titles! regal and taylor then grab london and suplex him face-first into the ladder! jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot, dropkicks through the ladder to nail jeff! awesome! in the end, london and kendrick retain the tag team titles. what a match!!!  this was insane. i can't figure out why wwe did not announce this till now. the buyrate would increase huge. i'm sure the replay value will be good though.  mercury has suffered a shattered nose and lacerations to the eye. he is at the hospital now. get well kid.  no way anything else here will top that.  next up: the miz v. boogeyman.(ugh) this was a nothing match. will the boogeyman ever wrestle? the miz sucks too. after a insane crowd, this kills them dead. dud.  chris benoit v. chavo. this was a strong match. i enjoyed it. chavo hit a killer superplex at one point! benoit hit eight german suplexes too! benoit wins with the sharpshooter. good stuff.  helms v. yang-cruiserweight title championship match. this was a good match. unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care for this. why? helms and yang are very talented and wrestled well. i agree with jbl. he ranted to the crowd. jbl is 100% correct. learn to appreciate this or get out.   mr. kennedy v. the undertaker-last ride match. not too much here. this was a slug fest, with a few exceptions. kennedy at one point tossed taker off the top of the stage to the floor. the spot was fine. reaction was disappointing. the end spot was taker tomb-stoned kennedy on the hearse and won the match. unreal. kennedy needed this win. they both worker hard. still, kennedy needed this win. undertaker should have lost. creative screwed up again.  a stupid diva thing is next. i like women. not this. at least torrie was not here. that's refreshing. judging from the crowd, layla should have won. the wwe wanted ashley. consider this your bathroom break. next.  main event: cena & batista v. finlay & booker t. this was also a nothing match. the focus was cena v. finlay and batista v. booker. batista and booker can't work well together. finlay tries to make cena look good. the finish was botched. finlay hit batista's knee with a chair shot and batista no-sold the shot and finished the match. lame. not main event caliber at all.  overall, armageddon would have scored less, but the ladder match was the main event here. that was enough money's worth right there. a few others were solid.   the last word: a good ppv with the ladder match being the savior. smackdown is not a bad show just is not compelling enough. smackdown needs to stop letting cena tag along. let smackdown stand on their own two legs. this show proves that smackdown can.",1
"by the end of the first hour my jaw was nestled comfortably between my feet. the movie never, and i do mean never, lets up in action. it may be mild action but it's action. once again every member of the cast fits perfectly. the explosions were realistic, the chase scenes were feasible, and the fighting was incredible. matt damon will forever be jason bourne.  all i really have to say is that every bourne movie gets better and this is no exception. the action, the stakes, the plot. how they do it i will never know. i applaud the man who wrote the screen plays to every one of these movies. because if he hadn't done such a great job with the first movie, we wouldn't have this one to talk about.  so don't go see it in theaters, go experience it in theaters if it's still out where you live, but if not december 11th bourne comes home to you!",1
"as i drove from skagway, alaska to dawson city,yukon a couple of years ago and was impressed with the scenery, i cannot help but wish that this film even though it has beautiful color and scenic views would have been shot in the actual location. jasper in the canadian rockies is a magnificent place, but still not the real place where the film takes place. when the story moves to dawson, that is when i feel anthony mann, who used the outdoor locations so well, could have made the most if he filmed in the actual place. james stewart here is again a man fighting within himself, one side of him does not want to get involved and help people who stand in the way of him making money, and the other side just is not able to look away from people being murdered. ruth roman is the ambitious woman who does not care on whom she steps, corinne calvet is the nice girl. mann is excellent directing the shootouts, but the high point of the film is how well he does in the outdoor scenes. he uses the outdoors as much as he can and he is helped by the winter scenery, the predominating white, like it was with the greens in ""the naked spur"" and the browns in ""the man from laramie"". like all of the mann-stewarts, this is a traditional western, with a difference in the elaboration of stewart's character which is more complex.",1

"the original thunderbirds earned a place in tv history. it was, and still is, much beloved - indeed, the entire first 10 minutes of the wallace and gromit movie (the wererabbit) is a direct lift of thunderbirds, down to a direct replay of the original thunderbird 2 launching sequence (if you don't believe me, get the movie, and then get a copy of the original episode where thunderbird 2 is launched).  this movie was a crass attempt at making a kids' movie - when the original was loved and enjoyed by kids and adults alike! in the original, the thunderbirds spent all of their time rescuing people who were often trapped when mother nature or technology went horrible wrong (yes, there was also the occasional criminal act). the thunderbirds put their own lives and resources at risk for no reward - the very essence of heroism and selflessness. there was little physical violence. the thunderbirds challenged the imagination to a degree - how many of us would dream of someday building a thunderbird 2? and don't underestimate the power of entertainment to do this - many japanese attribute their fascination with humanoid robots to the old astroboy cartoon.  but this movie was a poor re-image of the original. this movie came across as a meld between thunderbirds and loony tunes - i mean, we have anthony edwards as brain imitating porky pig's stuttering????? much of the action consists of kung fu/power rangers type fighting. indeed, there were funny sound effects when someone got nailed on the head with a frying pan. the tech that fired our imagination was absent - instead we have these kids running around, using a plot device that was never in the original series (having the entire team take off at once, leaving the base occupied by the kids and brain). then there was a dose of ""use the force luke"" mysticism thrown in when tintin would levitate something or another, coupled with the the hood using aerodynamics that looked like they were lifted from ""crouching tiger, hidden dragon"". about the only thing missing was for the hood to go ""tintin, i am your uncle"" with a breath mask voice. the heart that made thunderbirds unique was gone.  the only bright point was ron cook's portrayal of parker - he caught it perfectly. but the actress playing lady penelope came across as a child - huh????   and this is why we hate this movie. when someone puts out something that was popular to a fan base, and expects the fans to shell out money to watch, and then delivers something than wasn't even close to what the fans expect - well, i am sorry, that is just plain wrong! ok, so if they were making a kids' movie - fine - next time distribute it straight to video, where many of these belong. but don't package something up in a familiar wrapper and change the innards.",0
"centered in the downtown and out skirts of detroit, this comedy i found to be a terrific new comedic duo. 'noriyuki pat morita' is a very funny man, who happens to be a cop from japan on the trail of an industrial secrets thief, who has stolen a 'proto type' turbo super charger, reluctantly he goes to the united states to follow the thief, after being ordered by his commander. pat's character collides with 'jay leno's' character, a fast talking' but down to business-player type detroit cop. when they cross paths though, the honorable 'ways' of japan meet the all-out old school detroit police investigative 'ways'. the two stumble and trip over each other at first, but then develop a 'rythym' that turns into an explosive two layered powerhouse team, that solves the case, cold. after battling a city crime boss for the stolen 'equiptment' and closing the case, these two go from despising each other to being friends and working well together. a little worse for wear and in need of an extended-vacation on top of it all, they manage to come to a victorious closing. i rated this a 9. lewis's direction makes' this a near perfect comedy. fun for all ages. i recommend it highly.(***)",1

"coming immediately on the heels of match point (2005), a fine if somewhat self-repetitive piece of ""serious woody,"" scoop gives new hope to allen's small but die-hard band of followers (among whom i number myself) that the master has once again found his form. a string of disappointing efforts, culminating in the dreary melinda and melinda (2004) and the embarrassing anything else (2003) raised serious doubts that another first rate woody comedy, with or without his own participation as an actor, was in the cards. happily, the cards turn out to be a tarot deck that serves as scoop's clever maguffin and proffers an optimistic reading for the future of woody allen comedy.  even more encouraging, woody's self-casting - sadly one of the weakest elements of his films in recent years - is here an inspired bit of self-parody as well as a humble recognition at last that he can no longer play romantic leads with women young enough to be his daughters or granddaughters. in scoop, allen astutely assigns himself the role of sid waterman, an aging magician with cheap tricks and tired stage-patter who, much like woody himself, has brought his act to london, where audiences - if not more receptive - are at least more polite. like chaplin's calvero in limelight (1952), sid waterman affords allen the opportunity to don the slightly distorted mask of an artist whose art has declined and whose audience is no longer large or appreciative. moreover, because they seem in character, allen's ticks and prolonged stammers are less distracting here than they have been in some time.   waterman's character also functions neatly in the plot. his fake magic body-dissolving box becomes the ironically plausible location for visitations from joe strombel (ian mcshane), a notorious journalistic muckraker and recent cardiac arrest victim. introduced on a river styx ferryboat-to-hades, strombel repeatedly jumps ship because he just can't rest in eternity without communicating one last ""scoop"" about the identity of the notorious ""tarot killer."" unfortunately, his initial return from the dead leads him to waterman's magic show and the only conduit for his hot lead turns out to be a journalism undergraduate, sondra pransky (scarlett johansson), who has been called up from the audience as a comic butt for the magician's climactic trick. sondra enthusiastically seizes the journalistic opportunity and drags the reluctant waterman into the investigation to play the role of her millionaire father. as demonstrated in lost in translation, johansson has a talent for comedy, and the querulous by-play between her and allen is very amusing - and all the more so for never threatening to become a prelude to romance.  scoop's serial killer plot, involving grisly murders of prostitutes and an aristocratic chief suspect, peter lyman (hugh jackman), is the no doubt predictable result of allen's lengthy sabbatical exposure to london's ubiquitous jack the ripper landmarks and lore. yet other facets of scoop (as of match point) also derive from woody's late life encounter with english culture. its class structure, manners, idiom, dress, architecture, and, yes, peculiar driving habits give woody fresh new material for wry observation of human behavior as well as sharp social satire. when, for instance, sondra is trying to ingratiate herself with peter lyman at a ritzy private club, waterman observes ""from his point of view we're scum."" a good deal of humor is also generated by the contretemps of stiffly reserved british social manners encountering waterman's insistent borscht-belt jewish plebeianism. and, then, of course, there is waterman's hilarious exit in a smart car he can't remember to drive on the left side of the road.  as usual, allen's humor in scoop includes heavy doses of in-jokes, taking the form of sly allusions to film and literary sources as well as, increasingly, references to his own filmography. in addition to the pervasive jack the ripper references, for instance, the film's soundtrack is dominated by an arrangement of grieg's ""the hall of the mountain king,"" compulsively whistled by hans beckert in m, the first masterpiece of the serial killer genre. the post-funeral gathering of journalists who discuss the exploits of newly departed joe strombel clearly mimics the opening of broadway danny rose (1984). references to deconstructing harry (1997) include the use of death as a character (along with his peculiar voice and costume), the use of mandelbaum as a character name, and the mention of adair university (harry's ""alma mater"" and where sondra is now a student). moreover, the systematic use of greek mythology in the underworld river cruise to hades recalls the use of greek gods and a chorus in mighty aphrodite (1995).  as to quotable gags, allen's scripts rely less on one-liners than they did earlier in his career, but scoop does provides at least a couple of memorable ones. to a question about his religion, waterman answers: ""i was born in the hebrew persuasion, but later i converted to narcissism."" and sondra snaps off this put-down of waterman's wannabe crime-detecting: ""if we put our heads together you'll hear a hollow noise."" all in all, scoop is by far woody allen's most satisfying comedy in a decade.",1
"curiously, it is rene russo's eyes and mouth--not buddy the gorilla's-- that emerge as the focal point of ""buddy"", a jim henson pictures production through francis ford coppola's zoetrope. somehow, countless close-ups of russo's face slipped passed in the post-production stages, and she literally fills the screen so many times the poor apes are upstaged. unintentionally funny true story adapted from gertrude ""trudy"" davies lint's memoirs about a wealthy doctor's wife who turns their mansion into a menagerie for pets and wild-life. the movie goes beyond good intentions...it positively drips with earnest sincerity. the movie never sparkles with the kind of ""family film"" magic that it needed, and before too long both the people and the animals seem distinctly programmed (nothing here feels real). about ten minutes in, two chimpanzees are goofing around in russo's kitchen and start throwing a butcher's knife back and forth (it misses alan cumming's head by inches); yet, no eyebrows are raised because it's all in a day's fun. still, when full-grown gorilla buddy gets crazy during a thunderstorm, the cops are called--and everyone stares at buddy through the window while he busts up the living room furniture. the furniture should be the least of anyone's worries in this flabbergasting, do-gooder failure. but, at least we know russo was in good hands: whenever director caroline thompson needs a good pick-up shot, she gives unstartled rene another extreme close-up. i wonder what the lipstick budget was on this picture? ** from ****",0

"""the house that dripped blood"" is one of the better anthology films of the time period.  **spoilers**  tracking down a missing film star, inspector holloway, (john bennett) finds that the last reported sighting was in a large mansion in the countryside. during the course of looking through the house, he is told four different stories about past residents of the house.  the good story(s): method for murder-moving into the mysterious manor to get some peace and quiet while charles pens his latest masterwork, horror novelist charles hillyer, (denholm elliott) and his wife alice, (joanna dunham) are thrilled with the story, which centers around a serial strangler named dominic. after a series of strange accidents and experiences in the house, charles begins to believe that the creation my have come to life and is haunting him and his wife. probably one of the better entries in the film, it's easily the creepiest. the atmosphere here is what sets it apart. the scenes with the fictional character are genuinely creepy, the mystery surrounding him is really effective and there's always a classic creep-out moment. the classic moment is the kill in the psychiatrist's office, which is an all-time high for creepiness. the build-up to it, with the creaking sounds, quick flashes of a mysterious being, and the thunder and lightning in the back ground work well for this one's favor.  sweets for the sweet-moving into a new house, widower john reid, (christopher lee) hires former school teacher ann norton, (nyree dawn porter) for his young daughter jane, (chloe franks) while he's away on business. ann gradually begins to unravel a dark secret from jane's past, which john vehemently denies. when she learns the true nature of what has happened, it's far more shocking that what she could've thought possible. with the creepiest outright plot and the biggest twist of the stories, this is a quite pleasant entry. the mystery of the family is wonderfully played out, with small amounts of clues piled up here and there, and the final revelation is downright nerve-wracking. that part alone is the main reason why this one works, and lee doesn't harm it either.  the bad story(s): waxwork-tortured by memories of his lost love, phillip grayson, (peter cushing) and his friend neville rogers, (joss ackland) both become infatuated with a statue of a woman in a wax museum, as the statue takes over their lives, they discover a shocking secret about the museum that haunts the both of them. there's a clever premise here, and it does provide an excuse to spend time in a wax museum, which are always creepy. this is no exception, and it looks eerie, which is helped by the florescent lighting on display on the sculptures. a dream sequence provides a great moment of suspense, but what ultimately kills this one is the slow pace. it takes a long time for events to unfold out, and most of the time is spent on exposition. it also builds up to a shock ending that can be seen coming from a mile away. those really lower this one a bit. had the twist been changed, it would've scored higher, the rest is acceptable.  the cloak-veteran horror film actor paul henderson, (jon pertwee) upset at the lack of realism on the set of his new film, goes off and buys a new vampire cloak from a specialty store. the cloak soon turns him into a vampire, going crazy on the set with co-star carla, (ingrid pitt) and other vampiric acts at home. unconvinced the cloak is the cause, he does everything he can to prove it's just in his imagination. this has a pretty decent premise, and there is plenty of opportunity for some decent scares, but what sinks it is several factors. first, it's just too goofy for it's own good. the plot twist at the end is a perfect example, which is so overdone that it's not really a shock at all, and just comes across as just plain silly. there's so few scenes of scares or attempted scares that it's just a bore to sit through. it's the weakest one in the film.  the final verdict: a quite decent omnibus film, there's a few small problems scattered through each of the stories that renders this a less than perfect but still highly watchable film. highly recommended for those into the similar films at the time or who enjoy british horror films.  today's rating-pg-13: violence",1

"the dentist is a really good thriller. and pretty disturbing. i think we can all agree that the chances of running into a psycho dentist are much bigger than running into monsters, vampires or zombies. that's exactly why this movie is so scary. during this film, you'll probably think about your own dentist a few times. whether he's capable of doing such things...you better pray his wife doesn't cheat on him. that's what the story is all about. a respected dentist in la snaps when he finds out his wife is cheating on him with the pool-boy. ( that must be the greatest profession in the world, by the way. poolboys always take advantage of the housewives when the husband is at his work) from then on our dentist, dr. feinstone, can only thing about taking revenge. he can't concentrate on his patients anymore and a couple of them get hurt. things aren't made easier for our dentist when he's chased by an annoying tax-controller, a curious cop and a suspicious staff member of his. at one point, dr. feinstone can't take it anymore. now he's not only after his wife but after everyone who comes near him.. the dentist is written and directed by brian yuzna and co-written by stuart gordon. you can take that as a recommendation to itself. these 2 persons already gave us a few great horror movies ( and personal favorites of mine ) like re-animator, from beyond and society. with the dentist, they succeed once more to bring an entertaining and very chilling thriller. this film came right on time actually. the decade hadn't brought us many great horror films so far. i'm not at all saying this is a masterpiece, but it's a nice change. corbin bensen is great as the dentist obsessed by hygiene. i remember him mostly as a comedy or drama actor, but he can sure handle a psychotic character. the rest of the cast does good work too. the woman who plays feinstone's wife is really attractive. also, it was great to see ken foree acting again. the actor from my all time favorite movie dawn of the dead plays the cop in this film. yuzna casted him in from beyond too, 15 years ago and i thank him for that. i don't recommend this movie to everyone (if you have a weak stomach, i'll advise you to skip it) but if you do watch it, you'll enjoy it very much. you'll be disgusted...but that's an extra reason, i think. it's been a while since i was really freaked out by watching a film. it's a great topic to handle in the genre and yuzna does it in a great way. too bad this film was followed by a completely unnecessary sequel. my humble opinion on the dentist ... 8/10",1
"oh, those sneaky italians. it's not the first time they based a movie on source material without the permission or knowledge of the, in this case, author of the novel. of course this is not something that is typically italian but got done quite a lot in the early days of cinema, mostly because they often thought they would be able to get away with it. james m. cain's publishers managed to keep this movie off american screens until 1976 but nevertheless the movie itself has grown a bit into a well known classic.  the movie is not as great to watch as the 1946 american version but it's a great movie nevertheless. this of course not in the least is due to the movie it's great strong story, that is an intriguing one and provides the movie with some great characters and realism. it follows the novel quite closely and is therefore mostly the same as other movie versions of its story, with of course as a difference that it got set in an italian environment.  leave it up to the italians to make a movie about life and the real people in it. these early drama's always have a very realistic feeling over it and are therefore also quite involving to watch. unfortunately the movie lost some of its power toward the end, when the movie started to feel a bit overlong and dragging in parts. the movie could had easily ended 15 minutes earlier.  nevertheless, i don't really have much else negative to say about this movie. it's simply a greatly made one, based on some equally great and strong source material. quite an impressive directorial debut for luchino visconti, who continued to direct some many more great and memorable italian dramatic movies.  8/10",1
"after too many bad memories, i took to skipping this episode each time it showed up in the season 2 sequence. i recently watched it again just to remind me why. i've always considered this the worst st:tng episode (with the exception of ""shades of gray,"" which barely counts as an episode at all).  i keep listening to the clunky dialogue and thinking of the script red-penciled by the author's writing 101 teacher: ""show, don't tell!"" from deanna troi's pronouncement, and everyone else's constant elbowing reminders about what a charming, dangerous rogue okona is, to guinan's explanation about how funny her droid joke is (it isn't), to the who-cares resolution to the conflict, there isn't a plot point that isn't highlighted and triple-underlined for our edification, and there ain't a believable moment in any of it. unfortunately, bill campbell, a charming actor in other circumstances, is too puppy-dog huggable to be the center of the machinations of the plot. on the other hand, it could be that no one short of john barrowman (jack harkness from ""doctor who"") could pull of this underwritten placeholder of a role.  (zero points, by the way, to the data subplot. while i think joe piscopo stopped being funny decades ago, he and brent spiner had nothing to work with here. although the jerry lewis bit was funny in a stupid way.)  on a good day, you may be able to think of this as a charming little homage to a lesser original series episode. me, i'd rather skip ahead to ""time squared"" or ""q who.""",0

"as i mentioned previously, john carpenter's 1978 classic is one of the first two movies i can remember seeing and being heavily influenced by (the other being the classic conan the barbarian). it so truly scared me that the only monster under my bed was michael meyers, whom i eventually befriended (imaginary friend) to keep him from killing me in my sleep. now that is terror for a 10 year old.  it is a horror classic and i am sure my modest review will not do it the justice it deserves. the most surprising thing of all is that the movie still works, perhaps not in the guttural reaction but more of a cognitive possibility or immediate subconscious. this all could happen. it isn't in the realm of impossibility or located in a foreign country (as most modern horror is, i.e. hostel, touristas, cry wolf, saw,etc). at times it is graphic while the rest is relegated to our imaginations. i believe it is this element that keeps people terrified or at the very least wary of going outside at night with the signature soundtrack still vivid in their head. it still works because we can substitute implied or tertiary killing with anything more terrifying that our mind can create. so we ourselves are contributing to our own fears and anxiety.  carpenter weaves a simple story about an everyday, middle class, suburban and relatively benign child who snaps on halloween and kills his sister. he then spends the next 15 years in an institution (which we thankfully do not experience) only to escape and return to his hometown, the infamous haddonfield. on his way he kills and kills. the child's name is michael meyers, though he is not a person. john carpenter uses michael meyers as a metaphor against the implied safety of middle class suburbia. in the bastion of american safety and security, chaos can still strike.  michael ceased to be a person once he killed. he is not a serial killer, human being or psychopath. he is as unstoppable force. the generic overalls, bleached-white shatner mask, and lack of any dialog other then some breathing, helps to dehumanize and complete michael's generification. this is the source of all his power. he is faceless, speechless and unremarkable in any way other than as a source of unrelenting chaos. this is helped by the cinematography (post card effect), a lack of information/motivation/explanation and the veteran narrative experience of donald pleasence (dr. loomis). his over the top performance and uneasiness sells ""the shape"". this is also the first film performance by jamie lee curtis as laurie strode, the innocent girl who deters chaos in the face of overwhelming odds (at least for a little bit).   though this isn't the first movie of this new niche of horror films (black christmas came out 4 years earlier), it is the most successful and does not diminish upon reviewing. if you haven't been scared by horror movies in a long time (like me), this will probably make the hairs on the back of your head tingle at the first chords of the signature soundtrack. i highly recommend this movie as a must see horror movie and as one of the pinnacles of john carpenter's career.",1

"while i can't deny that his movies are often entertaining, i have always personally felt that martin scorsese is just a little overrated in his abilities. his use of flashy stylistics in a good number of his movies seems to scream ""look at me, aren't i an imaginative director?"". his best film that i have seen is the one with the least added flourishes, the superlative ""raging bull"".  for this remake it appears it was business as usual, though. the dull film stock to convey a 1950's setting was so bland as to be a distraction in itself. the melodramatic close-ups combined with the sub-par imitation of the classic ""psycho"" score are more likely to provoke smirks of derision than a sense of atmospheric terror. the score for ""psycho"" was brilliantly unnerving, this 'homage' just sounds shrill and annoying. even the cast, who can be decent at times, deliver histrionic performances that just scream 'caricature'; the notable exception to this being an intelligent turn by lewis as the impressionable teenage daughter of the bowden family.  the worst acting offender here is surprisingly de niro. sure, he looks suitably menacing but as soon as he opens his mouth that aura just drains away. now i'm no expert on american accents, me originally coming from near manchester in england an' all, but surely he could've come up with a more convincing southern drawl than that? being the gifted physical actor he is, he almost overcomes this fatal flaw, but not quite. it was disconcerting for me, as a de niro fan, to be wishing he was off screen, rather than rapt at his performance.  (possible spoilers.)  the over-the-top style of the whole movie extends to the ridiculously overblown finale. when will scorsese learn that underplaying the situation can sometimes build tension just as effectively as giving the viewer a visual and sonic bombardment? i also thought that he was too respected a reputation to resort to the 'killer-not-dead-yet' cheap trick that less talented individuals might employ.  all in all, a thoroughly ridiculous 'thriller'. scorsese and de niro have done much better work together.",0
"a film like amazing grace and chuck is a perfect example of how the left in this country just doesn't get it. they never did. and liberalism continues to slip further and further into political oblivion.  this film deals with a little league baseball star who decides to stop playing ball as a protest to the existence of nuclear weapons. the boy is understandably ridiculed until a bevy of professional athletes, led by former nba star alex english, join his cause. not just a few of them join the cause. by the time his movement reaches its zenith, entire leagues of professional and college sports have to cancel their seasons since nobody will play any more. just to move this review along, i'm prepared to grant them this premise. even though it would never happen in a million years, i'll just imagine it could, then go from there.  i don't quite remember how, but some type of agreement is reached, and the boy decides to go back to the game he loves in an incredibly sappy and ridiculous scene.  before criticizing the message of this film, let me just say that this film is poorly written, acted and directed. even if one does agree with the boy's stance, it would be impossible to overcome how badly the film was constructed. and that's a shame since there are plenty of good actors that go to waste. (peck, curtis, petersen). alex english does as well as he could have with his character however, and i wish he would try to act in more films. alas, it's likely much easier to find work in the coaching world of the nba. one wishes mr. english would teach more of these thuggish nba types of today how to shoot the rock a little better. alex certainly knew how to put the ball through the hoop.  as far as the film's message in concerned, it's just wrong-headed. plain and simple. all of those nuclear warheads tucked away in those missile silos out west prevented war!!!!! it would be one thing for this boy and his flock to protest an actual war or the use of nuclear weapons. these weapons were in fact never used, and that was the genius behind their existence. neither side during the cold war was crazy enough to fire a single missile. without these weapons, who knows what might have happened between the usa and ussr.  the makers of this film obviously intended for kids in america to take up their cause and follow in chuck's footsteps. kids in america however are more intelligent than the left wing kooks who created this dreck.   the film is worth only 2 of 10 stars.  if you want to see a great film about the dangers of nuclear war, stick with dr. strangelove, instead.  mr. newell, you are no frank capra!",0

"when i read the summary of the movie, something like what happens when a man gets powers of a god, and how he later learns that having supernatural powers requires giant responsibility and strength, i though that was clever and original concept. casting was promising too, carrey, freeman, aniston... how can movie with a good idea and good actors, not to mention costs of filming, can be bad? it can. idea is good, but script and story itself is terrible. bruce nolan is, let's be honest, a pretty mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story of a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the niagara report is complete fiasco!), he's a man with a job he completely deserves (he's not a good journalist, he's a comedian), considering his potentials, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend, and oh horror!!!! dog who is not house trained!!! yes, as soon as bruce, at the beginning of the movie starts addressing god in a ""god, why do you hate me!"" manner, average viewer must think: ""why, what's wrong with your life, bruce?"". bruce is not, and definitely not the man with real problems in life. most the troubles that happen to him are minor and not really worth of all that fuss he makes, and some of them are really only the result of his stupidity. most people have really big problems, worth of attention, most people are more worth of attention that bruce, who doesn't seem too human after all, doesn't look even realistic, too goofy and neurotic, but god still addresses to him. why? though morgan freeman looks nice as a god, i can't help but to ask what is he doing in this particularly bad movie. and what does bruce do when god gives him his powers? god in this movie could as easily give his powers to a 5 year old kid and there hardly would be any difference. no, wait, a smart kid would probably use his god powers better than bruce. what does bruce do? pulls the moon closer to earth to create romantic atmosphere, parts the red soup, lifts up a pretty woman's dress on the street, answers prayers via e-mail and make all of them come true!!!! no more, bruce, please! what bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie, that doesn't happen, because this is ""nice, family, little movie"" and doesn't make any sense at all!!! not a hint of sarcasm, of real humor, of wittiness, of some dirty humor at least!!! nothing. just carrey playing silly, which is starting to look pathetic on middle aged actor. aniston here is understated. she plays pale, undeveloped character of bruce's girlfriend grace, and stays completely forgettable in this movie. nobody in the right mind would believe that this two have any chemistry at all between them. when grace says prayer for bruce it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely false. these two are not meant to be together. i would give three stars, but i doubt movie deserves a one. bad script, lame dialogs, lack of real humor, wittiness and any sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated freeman's and aniston's roles, total lack of boldness and sarcasm, it all makes movie hardly worth ***. but ok, there were few funny moments, and freeman is always nice to see in any movie so, lets leave three stars.",0
"i haven't seen ""henry fool"", but after watching ""fay grim"" i'm not sure i want to. maybe hartley aims to be the ""anti-thriller"" director---he sure succeeded with this yawner. based on the official description---woman discovers that her dead husband's manuscript contains material that could pose a threat to national security---i expected a taut geopolitical drama. instead i got flimsy structure, goofy dialog, flabby characterizations, a convoluted plot, and a ""tone"" that shifts so often it suggests that hartley changed the script according to his mood at any given time. i can hang for a long time with a frustrating, hard-to-follow plot (e.g. ""duplicity"") because i figure that the loose ends eventually will come together. even when they don't, or they do but they leave lingering questions (e.g. ""duplicity""), sharp writing and acting can hold one's interest. but half-way through ""fay grim"" i reached a deadly realization---i didn't know what was going on, and i didn't care. too bad, because i really like parker posey, reduced here to working with an absurd part that asked her to morph from indifferent, estranged wife and indifferent, clueless mother to tough, shrewd international ""player"" capable of psychological mano a mano with terrorists. there's also bad casting. jeff goldblum can be very good, but he's not capable of overcoming miscasting as a cia operative. he looks almost as uncomfortable in the role as i was watching him in it. his cia sidekick is worse; he looks like a refugee from the quarterfinals of ""american idol"" (are there really young cia agents with big licks of hair rakishly draped over their foreheads?). then there's the sticky question of the characters' ages. goldblum was 54 when he made ""fay grim""; thomas jay ryan, who plays ""henry fool"", was 44. neither was made to look or seem older than their actual ages. yet, a key point in the story is that they served as cia agents in nicaragua ""back in the '70s."" goldblum's character would've been in his 20s then; henry fool would've been a teenager. was hartley being ""quirky"" or lazy? the problems are too numerous to list...",0
"i saw this movie, and at times, i was unnerved believing this movie 'saw me.' munchie sullies the 'farce' for years to come. re-watch star wars, don't-watch munchie.  as a responsible parent (i'm speaking to those who are parents now), i (you) would not let my (your) child ever partake of this video festival of the pseudo-occult. to insinuate munchie is satanic, to a co-viewer, is likely to illicit a chilled 'duh.' he is fiendish, alien, rodential, and wholly malevolent - like the bogey man made flesh, invisible to adults, tempting children with lifestyles they could never afford (without the income made possible by years of self denial and prudent stewardship). he is a peddler of easy answers, and false ideals. he is everything the morally conscious viewer is not. he is the devil's own ron popeil.  i pray (i mean this literally and figuratively, with an emphasis on the former) that this movie has not made the format jump to dvd. it is my hope that this type of 'yellow film making' died an un-mourned death in the cold nights of 1994.  munchie also loves pizza. i forgot to mention that. it comes up a lot.",0
"i rented this film from netflix for two reasons - i was in the mood for what i thought would be a silly '50s sci-fi-asco and because it is the first feature-length superman film. needless to say, after about 15 minutes i found myself thoroughly engaged and very pleasantly surprised.  an experimental oil well has penetrated about six miles into the earth and is being shut down by the sponsor. lois and clark show up to get the scoop but are disappointed that the deepest well ever drilled will no longer be in operation. a day later, strange events at the well make for a story more appropriate for superman than clark kent. it seems that the radioactive mole men have invaded from their six-mile deep home near the earth's core.  supermen and the mole men is a simplistic but well-made piece of social realism. released in 1951, starring a lead actor who served in world war ii, the moral of the story seems to be that americans are just as capable of becoming fascists as anybody else. to drive this point home in a typically straightforward superman manner, reeves even accuses the lynch mob hunting the mole men of being 'nazis' at one point.  even in the 1950s, the science underlying this film was nonexistent. six miles of drilling through continental crust would not have even penetrated the upper mantle, let alone the ""hollow center of the earth"" - which, in any case does not exist. forgivable - keep in mind that this film is based on a golden age comic book.  the film is a little unevenly paced. although the molemen are interesting, a bit creepy, and nicely portrayed, there are several corman-esquire scenes which spend too much time redundantly showing us their odd behavior. the script is intelligent and economical. by today's standards, the costuming is poor to fair, but for its time, this film's special effects and costuming were quite good. the cinematography is also generally very good, and the acting is much better than one might expect. i was particularly impressed with reeves, jeff corey and walter reed.",1
"i have seen maslin beach a couple of times - both on free to air tv in brisbane. i won't go into whether it is good, bad or otherwise as others have well and truly covered this.  i will say that it is so australian. only in australia can we have a film about relationships among people spending the day as naked as the day they were born, and to view it on free commercial television.  i have a friend from the us who is constantly amazed at what we put on our free tv compared to her home country. sex and the city and huff are just too examples.  despite our government trying to turn us into the 51st us state, it is good to know at least some things remain truly aussie",1
"i can't believe we watched this total piece of crap but we did and i feel obligated to warn others to avoid it at all costs. when one of the main characters announces that he's gay twice in the first five minutes, don't ignore it as typical pc nonsense and figure it has to get better because it won't. if his faggoty boyfriend hanging all over him doesn't make you sick, then be thankful the freak who wrote and/or directed this grossout is somehow attempting a little restraint. i mean, get real. it's one thing for there to be a gay character appearing in a movie in such screwed up times as these but quite another to have it continually slapped on the screen and examined up close and personal when the the liner notes clearly state the flick's supposed to be about a mother seeking some sort of ""closure"" over the sudden death of her daughter. what does one thing have to do with the other, one might be tempted to ask? apparently, the two issues are inextricably interwoven. and if that weren't bad enough, there's the bearded lady at the ice cream parlor. i mean, seriously, hasn't that poor woman ever heard of electrolysis? why must she go around like that? at the very least, how about shaving the ugly thing off, and while you're at it, have those horrible moles removed, too. would you slurp up some ice cream she just served you? i think not. it must be a new jersey thing.   you'd think diane keaton might save this piece of drek, but think again. was she actually trying to put lipstick on a corpse? i don't even wanna think about it. so what if the body was supposed to be that of her own dead daughter. this grotesque excuse for cinema is slop from the word go and that's all there is to it. one wishes that each of these characters would simply walk out into the waves and just keep going. none of these flaky people even remotely gain our sympathy for an instant. trust me -- pass this piece of crap up. it's not about death, a mother who inadvertently suffocated her daughter, or even the other much more unsavory issues it keeps bringing up no matter how little you want to hear it. it's a load of perverted trash from a misguided and talentless director.",0
"this god forsaken film is about three dumb millionaires who gather a bunch of people to play a deadly game, and the winner gets a million dollars. first of all, the acting is terrible, and the movie makes absolutely no sense at all. it is not scary in the least bit, it is so stupid that it made me laugh, which is why it earned that 1 star.the movie is not violent at all, but is pretty sleazy and focuses mostly on the women's breasts the whole time, and some of the characters are very annoying and whiny. plus, the monsters in this movie are so cheesy and fake and not scary that it just makes you want to throw something at the screen. last, but not least the ending is terrible. i don't want to give it away, in case you actually are strange enough to see this piece of junk. avoid at all costs!!!!!  not rated (but should be r) for nudity, profanity, and mild gore.",0
"the cliché of the shell-shocked soldier home from the war is here given dull treatment. pity a splendid cast, acting to the limits of their high talents, can't redeem 'the return of the soldier' from its stiff-collared inability to move the viewer to emotional involvement. best moments, as another reviewer noted, come when glenda jackson is on screen; but even jackson's crackling good cinematic power can't pull this film's chestnuts from its cold, never warmed hearth. ann-margret, she of sex-kitten repute and too often accused of lacking acting ability, finds her actual and rather profound abilities wasted here - despite her speaking with a nigh-flawless middlesex accent. the hackneyed score, redolent of many lackluster tv miniseries' slathered-on saccharine emotionalism, is at irritating odds with the emotional remoteness of the script, blocking, and overbaked formalism of the direction; except for its score and corseted script and direction, 'the return of the soldier' has all the right bits but it fails to make them work together.",0
"dark wolf (quick review) let's get right to it: this is a repugnant piece of rotting roadkill with cow sh*t on it. it's just an awful movie. it's an urban werewolf movie with some of the worst acting imaginable and a story as weak as any gangly nerd from an 80's high school drama film. what's worse is that poor kane hodder was duped into playing the gigantic evil werewolf. kane f*cking hodder. someone's trying to ensure that playing jason voorhees is the height of his film career...  anyway, former playmate jaime bergman is also in the movie and she eventually becomes a werewolf, too. it's kind of a crappy cop drama with the world's worst looking werewolf in it. but it does have moments of near-rampant nudity. but that's about all. want to know more? okay, the werewolf is generally an ugly-looking black blur zipping around the screen. and when we're privileged enough to actually see a transformation sequence, we're presented with something that resembles a full-motion video from a video game made during the early stages of the playstation. the first playstation. the cg animation is really that primitive. only good for horror hardcore fanatics that want to see small moments of nudity surrounded by rampant visual vomit. 2/10  www.residenthazard.com",0
"*** out of ****  yep! dressed to kill is that kind of a movie. it's like kalifornia, but it's different. remember? that movie from 1993 which stars brad pitt as a serial killer who is ""welcomed"" by a couple of travelers in a trip to california as a buddy who might be a good company along the way. when i watch a movie, i always like not to know anything at all about the plot, before watching it, because the surprises may get even cooler. that's how it was with kalifornia. when i watched it last year for the first time, i never realized it was a suspense movie, so when i found out, i was shocked, and when the movie went on and on, it got even better and i was at the edge of my seat, almost kissing my monitor, so close i was to it! so, we're discussing about dressed to kill, right? before i watched this movie (today!), i've only watched 2 others movies from brian de palma, so i can say i don't really know that well his works, but can tell from afar that these 2 movies for me were as great as they could be. carrie (1976) and mission:impossible (1996). when i watched carrie on the tv, i was really that desperate to get a dvd copy and i can tell: this movie is great! mission:impossible also. and today, i watched a third movie from depalma.   well, dressed to kill is a movie like kalifornia. when the movie goes on, it goes completely different than what you'd expect. i was watching, very curious, the scene of the museum, where dickinson follows the mysterious man to his cab and they end together in an apartment room. you may guess what may have happened there. but when the movie reached the scene of the elevator, the movie went completely on a different path. i was watching the rest of the movie, and i really liked it. however, there are some low points... some characters in the movie are completely silent! take, for example, the mysterious man from the museum scene. i was always hoping that he could say something but he never did! this was totally ridiculous and was with no doubt something that made me change my mind by not accepting this movie as at least almost something as a masterpiece. even in the cab scene, where dickinson tries to apologize because of what happened in the museum, the completely silent man grabs her, pulls her inside the cab, and they start kissing each other. you know, it reminded me of the mexican tv series of the 70's ""el chavo del 8"", where some characters are completely silent. getting past these low points of the movie, it is actually a great movie, considering the suspense, the characters and the plot. dennis franz is cool as detective marino! reminded me of him as capt. carmine lorenzo in die hard 2 (1990) where he plays almost the same kind of character.   well, concluding this review, the ending of dressed to kill is the same ending as it is in carrie! i don't know if i really liked that, because i hate imitations! i understand that carrie is a movie from depalma, so it's not actually an imitation, because after all it was his idea! but it turned to be a repetitive idea in dressed to kill, so depalma could have done something different instead of showing nancy allen waking up from a bad dream the same way it happens to amy irving at the ending scene of carrie. this was, of course, with no doubt, another low point. but if you get past this, you will find that dressed to kill is a really good movie, and i assure you that it's not, by any means, a waste of time watching it.",1
"why do people who do not know what a particular time in the past was like feel the need to try to define that time for others? replace woodstock with the civil war and the apollo moon-landing with the titanic sinking and you've got as realistic a flick as this formulaic soap opera populated entirely by low-life trash. is this what kids who were too young to be allowed to go to woodstock and who failed grade school composition do? ""i'll show those old meanies, i'll put out my own movie and prove that you don't have to know nuttin about your topic to still make money!"" yeah, we already know that. the one thing watching this film did for me was to give me a little insight into underclass thinking. the next time i see a slut in a bar who looks like diane lane, i'm running the other way. it's child abuse to let parents that worthless raise kids. it's audience abuse to simply stick woodstock and the moonlanding into a flick as if that ipso facto means the film portrays 1969.",0
"i saw this film at the rhode island international film festival and was completely blown away. the structure and execution of the film was fantastic...i know it won't, but it really deserves an oscar nod. cal and andre were phenomenal as the two disturbed classmates. yes, the film is very controversial and i can see a lot of people having a lot of problems with it, as it deals with school shooting and especially makes you identify with the killers. however, despite its harsh and blunt subject matter, zero day is so worth watching. i'm looking forward to it coming out on video so i can buy it - it's very, very good. very powerful and intense...the end shooting sequence leaves you speechless because it's almost too realistic. their uncertainty, the ""recordings"", the footage and panic of the students, totally indescribable. i really hope it gets the attention it deserves. it's done in the same format as the blair witch project, handheld camera, made to appear as a true home video documentary kind of film - but god is it infinitely better. very impressive, hats off to everyone involved. if you've got the chance you really should see it.",1
"i do not believe all the praise for this movie. the play and movie were a ripoff of sleuth. michael caine wishes he were olivier, and reeves wishes he were caine. caine even had the nerve to do a remake of sleuth with jude law playing his original part. jude law? you mean the one that did the remake of ""alfie""?   this movie was made during a period of caine's career when it was obvious he needed to pay off gambling debts. he would do anything for money. he would star in such award winning movies such as this, and ""beyond the poseidon adventure"". what seems to be driving the praise for this movie is reeves death. he deserves better than to be remembered for this lousy movie. and so does caine. this movie can be found in the $5.97 bin at walmart. along with gems like ""the island"", and ""blame it on rio"".",0

"i watched this film based on the very favorable reviews that i read about it here by others.  they definitely saw something in this movie i didn't see, that's for sure.  the movie starts off at a good pace, and the first 15 or 20 minutes of it are interesting, then it begins to get logged down and draggy, not to mention completely unbelievable.  eventually you find yourself saying: ""what?!? he's going to do that too? just how far is he going to go with this thing?""  the plot begins with jeff goldblum's character, john, going into a deli to purchase a bottle of wine. there is a robbery and a new store clerk, auggie rose, gets killed during the robbery.   john gets in the ambulance and goes to the hospital with the guy. this seems a little much, but wait, there's more.  john becomes totally obsessed with auggie rose.   for reasons that never make any kind of logical sense, john, who has a very good life, a beautiful, loving girlfriend, a secure, well-paying job, nice house, nice car, expensive suits--decides he wants to be a loser like auggie rose was, and experience life in a low paying job, living in a dump with a dippy girlfriend and possible connections with dangerous people.  why this dim-witted, half-baked film got favorable reviews i'll never know. sure goldblum does a good acting job - he always does - and his looks have improved with age -- but unless you have a big infatuation with jeff goldblum and have to see every film he's in, i wouldn't recommend this turkey. it's approximately two hours of your life you're not going to get back - and believe me - you'll have nothing to be thankful about when those two hours are over, other than being grateful you're not still sitting there watching this film!

"this is such a fantastic movie, a western about a self-concerned man (jimmy stewart) going up to the klondike for gold. on the way, he gets hassled by a local sheriff in alaska (john mcintire, giving a wonderfully evil performance), whom he hassles back. mcintire threatens that he'll be a dead man if he ever comes back through his town, which is, unfortunately, the only way back to the states. the main chunk of the story is about the peaceful klondike town of dawson being turned upside down by new residents from mcintire's town. ruth roman, for instance, who has come with stewart and his two companions (jay c. flippen and walter brennen, who plays stewart's best friend), builds a saloon (a hollywood front for a whorehouse) and tries to run the town's restaurant and hang-out place out of business. she paves the way for mcintire and his goons to come up, too. in 1953, jimmy stewart and director anthony mann made one of the peaks of the western genre, the naked spur. the far country is just the tiniest bit less, and it contains 99.9% of what made that film so special without, of course, feeling like a cheap copy. like the naked spur, the far country boasts beautiful, on-location cinematography. the landscape is gorgeous. stewart gives one of his best performances (nearly equal to his biggest success of 1954, rear window). i suppose it could be considered cliche, as he starts out a selfish loner and learns how that kind of existence plays out in the end. still, stewart plays it so damn well, he makes this character very human. and the supporting performances are universally fantastic. in addition to those i've mentioned, the adorable french actress corinne calvet is very good. and i ought to single out walter brennen, as well. he seems to have specialized in playing best friends. his relationship with stewart is very touching, since he is, at first, the only character who is able to bring out any humanity in the cynical man. the screenplay is very well written, and mann's direction is impeccable. a masterpiece. 10/10.",1
"if you thought that the original from 83 was bad then try out this modern day masterpiece. how could it be worse more you ask? well...at least in the first one you had ally sheedy jogging in a sports bra. other than updated graphics, modern day themes (such as terrorists), modern weapons and a sexy new voice for ripley unfortunately this is the same sad tired story. anyone that saw the first one could see exactly where the next scene / line in the story was going. and for anyone that didn't see the first one...well consider yourself lucky that you only watched it once. maybe in another 23 years hollywood will try again.",0
"story of a man who has unnatural feelings for a pig. starts out with a opening scene that is a terrific example of absurd comedy. a formal orchestra audience is turned into an insane, violent mob by the crazy chantings of it's singers. unfortunately it stays absurd the whole time with no general narrative eventually making it just too off putting. even those from the era should be turned off. the cryptic dialogue would make shakespeare seem easy to a third grader. on a technical level it's better than you might think with some good cinematography by future great vilmos zsigmond. future stars sally kirkland and frederic forrest can be seen briefly.",0

"one of the last great musicals of the 60s. i was 7 years old the first time i saw this movie, and it's always been a favorite since then. the musical numbers are all memorable. in the 60s the people who were cast in musicals actually had musical talent (unlike a certain academy award nominated current musical based in a large midwestern city). all of the main roles were beautifully cast...ron moody shines as fagin, as does shani wallis as nancy. oliver reed was a menacing bill sikes (who thankfully has no musical numbers, lol), and mark lester as oliver and jack wild as the dodger were great too. mark lester comes across as an innocent waif, which was what dickens intended when he wrote the book! then, of course there are the dozens of dancers who perform in ""consider yourself,"" ""i'd do anything"" ""who will buy"" and ""be back soon,"" many who were children! this is a great show for the whole family.",1

"i really don't get how people made this film and thought it was worth all the work they put into it. even more puzzling are those who watched this film without feeling cheated out of 88 minutes of doing something valuable like cleaning under the couch or reading leviticus.   first of all, surely they could have 2 found real irish people, and some good-looking women who could deliver their lines better than the washed up, haggard porn stars sprinkled throughout this film. granted, the gore works- but strangely, it's not as troubling as you might think to see organs yanked out of the porn stars' hot (formerly) tight bodies left and right. probably has something to do with the fact that after their horrific inhuman acting you just want them to die in pain.  so, if you don't care at all about the following:   - acting (seriously, everyone sucked. i've never witnessed this before. everyone sucked).  -plot (some crappy horror movies are remotely linear, or at the very least surprising. this movie doesn't make sense unless you're as trashed as the writers obviously were).   - theme (nothing to learn from this film. nothing to be scared about in bed at night, nothing to contemplate or grasp, or explain to others).   - soundtrack (crap, crap, crap. music as ordinary and dull as the script).   - scenery (could have been this film's saving grace, but no...nothing pleasing here. even the rocks are fake).  so, yeah. if you don't care about that, and you're just a horny teen with bad taste in music and ""women,"" this movie is for you. positive comments: interesting cinematography at times, wasted on the other elements. very realistic gore; again, wasted. but the intestines scene is classic. i agree with the mutant- disembowelment solves the fake accent problem.",0

"this film, though ostensibly a comedy, is deadly serious. its subject is imperialism (with a capital i): how britain, foolishly, humiliatingly, tries to convince itself that it's still a great power after world war ii. at home, the empire is run by amiable dolts, benevolent tories who are so in-bred that they can't distinguish close relatives; the offices of government consist of long forgotten archives (a dig at orwellian paranoia?), inhabited by indolent rats, and ante-rooms wherein lounge bored synacures, reading popular novels.  abroad, britain clings to the old pomp; but pomp out of context looks threadbare and silly, especially when its embodied in bumbling twits. carlton-browne is an unsentimental picture of decline, with none of the lachrymose rot that marred the supposedly anti-imperialist jewel in the crown.  the film is also about the cold war, bravely admitting that it's a dangerous farce, whose participants deserve mockery and contempt, not fear and respect. it's about how colonialism, characterised more by neglect than tyranny, destroys the colonies it deserts, robbing them of amenities, power, and, most importantly, self-respect, leaving them vulnerable to the machinations of dangerous cowboys.  it's the seriousness, of course, that kills it. that's not to say that weighty subjects can't be treated in comedy - the miracle of morgan's creek, dr. strangelove and the life of brian have all proved that. indeed, one might suggest that serious themes should only be treated by comedy - it allows for a clearer-eyed view.  the problem with carlton-browne is that every situation must have a significance beyond the merely comic, so that it becomes weighed down and unfunny. in the three films mentioned above, much of the comedy arises from character reaction to an extreme situation, not the extreme situation itself. here, the script is too poor to sustain rich comic characterisations, and some of the greatest comedy talent ever assembled - peter sellers, terry-thomas, raymond huntley and john le mesurier - are criminally wasted.  terry-thomas, sublime so often, shows that he couldn't handle lead parts, and that he needed to play sneering, arrogant bounders, not brainless toffs. the music is made to carry much of the comedy, but its heavy irony only draws attention to the lack of hilarity on screen. (to be fair, unlike the majority of british comedies of the period, which were stagy and underproduced, the boultings often try to make their points through film itself, by montage and composition) only huntley manages to raise genuine laughs, and that's by essaying a character he could have played in his sleep.  none of the boultings' farces have dated well - they're never thought through enough. although carlton-browne revels in the decline of the empire, it also seems to be anti-democratic and militaristic. i'm sure this wasn't intended, but these blunders are bound to happen if you allow worthy intentions to take precedence over comic intelligence and film form.",0
"i don't know what you guys are inhaling, but please stop. this movie was complete trash.  macaulay culkin as kevin mccallister was lovable, cute, sweet, loving, and extremely fun to watch. he had that innocence but at the same time, he was strong as well.  this new kid, alex? annoying as all hell! just a blatant ripoff at trying to match culkin's charm and grace, failing miserably at that.  the villains, complete crap. harry and marv, they were such an entertaining on screen team. they were comedic, they were humorous, and just made you really want to root for culkin even more, which is what a good villain is suppose to do. these guys joe pesci and daniel stern, absolutely perfect for those roles. on the other hand, in 3, we have 4 new idiots that just bicker and again, try to capitalize on the charisma and duo charm of the first villains. not saying they were horrible, but they were not memorable or even really that entertaining. more on the corny side actually.  then we got the actual movies. part 1 and 2, classics. memorable. perfect to watch around christmas and brings a wonderful christmas feeling and brings out so many emotions. it makes you fall in love with the story, and care about the characters. simply, memorable and close to being masterpieces. part 3? masterpiece of crap. enough said.  all and all, i don't know why people like this. i think people really don't know what a good movie is anymore. its a crappy sequel rip-off with more unrealistic traps and a stupid new main character kid that i wish the robbers would of at least beat the crap out of.  run, run away from this garbage. and lets not even start with part 4!",0
"it ran from 1959-1973. its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series. its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50's , psychedelic 60's and remained popular in the 70's.  i remember repeats of this series. it was a successful combination of all its elements from stories, cast and productions that made it exceptional. lorne green had his defining iconic character from this series. its appeal was across generations. all members of the family could enjoy this. it balanced morality with violence, humour with seriousness. a cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact. the shame is that this series is no longer repeated and many will not know its significance.",1
"nyc, 2022: the greenhouse effect, vanished oceans, grinding unemployment and scarcity of water, power and food.. and new york's population has topped 40 million. this is a little gem of a picture, not least because a resource-depleted future is a reality for us 21st century citizens.   the low-budget opening titles of this movie are great: set to music, a low-tech 'tape-slide' sequence composed entirely of archive stills from the dawn of photography right up to 1973, depicts an unspoiled american pastoral developing into a polluted and crowded hell in less than 2 minutes. succinct and unambiguous, it's truly memorable. budget limitations are also behind rather unimaginative cinematography and other constraints, at odds with the story's brilliant premise. the police station sequences are like an episode of some 70's tv detective show, and the other interior sets look basic at best. the budget probably all went on trying to 'futurise' the soylent executive's 'chelsea west' apartment with state-of-the art goodies, meaning the other costumes are perfunctory, some establishing shots are bizarrely underpopulated and the daytime exteriors seemingly all shot through a smoke filter.  the memorable scene where sol and thorn (charlton heston) share a meal of expensive and rare food neatly summarises their society: they enjoy real bourbon, lettuce, celery, tomato, apple, and beef, and we really sense their lip-smacking appreciation of someone else's wealthy privileges.  robinson's pivotal death scene, in which his character is willingly euthenased at a place called 'home', depicts him immersed in images of the world's once-beautiful flora and fauna as he remembered them, beautifully contrasted with the jaundiced thorn's dawning realization that the future has been bankrupted, among other horrors.  this is one smart film, and its core message is as pertinent today as it was in the early 70s. yes, i know we're not eating the dead yet, but with our resource-sapping longevity, spiraling poverty gap, corporate global capitalism and unchecked habitat destruction leading to climate change, the lasting prediction of 'soylent green' may come to pass.",1
"the film really challenges your notions of identity and the society we live in. it is well made and very powerful. the persons in the film are honest and revealing about the world that exists outside of the normative ideological perspective. i believe it give great insight into a sub-culture who shakes the very ideas that the viewer has of society. it is shocking at times and more powerful because of it. some parts were difficult to watch, as most reality is, but it is not over done. its good the first time you watch it, but it becomes even better the second or third time around; because you have had the chance to wrap your mind around the very topics they discuss and challenge.",1
"this is the prime example of low budget, winning over what would be a good story line. let's bring back samaire armstrong (having seen her work on the o.c. i know she can do better), then find a better script and budget.  the special effects were so bad, and mostly badly computer generated, that it almost lost me with the first time the wolf was seen on-screen. and samaire armstrong's (alert!)changing into a werewolf was done by reducing her at first to a bad gcif figure before she even begins to change(final fantasy's humans, as well as pixar's made these laughable, think of the figure as a nude barbie doll).  the story of was interesting, though the idea of bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. as it also got into the balance between evil, (maybe) not so evil, and the possible end of human-kind should the two lines mate. the subplot of a ""book of werewolf linage"" which effected some of the other characters in a spell-like manner for a while was effective, but could have been expanded more in explaining what had happened in the past.   bring in a better script and direction, and i'd come back again.",0

"i was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be puerto rican. when i heard it was rosie perez, i wondered..could she possibly know what it is really like to be puerto rican. as far as i knew....she was a nuyorican. well anyway, i anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch. i realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right. rosie perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be puerto rican. this ""documentary"" is more a 1st hand, very very personal account on what it is like to be a nuyorican..and all of what that entails. she (like most of the nuyoricans i know) have a watered down, partial and sometimes twisted sense of history. (how could they not..they live here.) yes, all of them are proud. as they should be! but a lot don't know the ins and outs of the real culture, history and political background or language for the most part. it all became very very apparent with her participation in the vieques issue. regardless of my personal take is on this issue..at least i know what the hell the fight is for. there is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about.. and only participated in because it was a ""puerto rican cause"" i really don't understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it. for those of you that are not puerto rican, please view this as a partial account of a woman's journey of self discovery and acceptance. do not take this as gospel...a lot of it isn't even true. please consider the source. rosie is an actress; not a historian. this movie is not and should never be, for other nuyoricans, the base for their information. instead, just a step towards finding more info, learning and debating what the reality is. not just the one coming from this woman's eyes.",0

"saw this movie in my english class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was. don't get me wrong, george c. scott was terrific as scrooge, but the rest of the cast fails so very badly. sometimes i couldn't stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line: ""merry christmas to everyone!"" other times i almost fell asleep.  the movie is based on a charles dickens short story about a rich guy, who don't think christmas is nothing but humbug. after 30 minutes, the rich guy is visited by three ghosts, who persuade him to celebrate christmas after all.  i can not understand how this movie, with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes, can be so well-rated. instead of this piece of garbage, i recommend to you, the bill murray comedy scrooged. that at least, was funny...",0
"i don't think i've ever felt this let down by a film before. after loving guy ritchie's two previous films (i don't count swept away - he was pussy blind), i was so looking forward to seeing this.   the reviews were poor, then again, i don't trust the press anyway. more worrying was the fact that the internet buzz was that this was a bit of a stinker, so it was with some trepidation i handed over my £4.80 yesterday afternoon.  i'm not even going to try to explain this film, mainly because i haven't got a clue what was going on and at one point i was honestly close to standing up and asking if it was just me who didn't get it!   unfortunately i think ritchie seems to have fallen into his wife's trap of taking himself far too seriously.it seems it wasn't good enough for him to make films with good plots, laughs, snappy dialogue and good characters. it's almost as if he had a checklist of films he wanted to rip off, here are some of the ones i noticed:  the matrix, fight club, kill bill, the usual suspects, vanilla sky...  i think the most frustrating thing is that the performances from the two main actors, jason statham and ray liotta, were actually very good and it was really the self indulgent story and editing / direction that let the film down.  so a big, big thumbs down from me.",0
"how i got into it: when i started watching this series on cartoon network,i have to say that i've never seen anything like this,and it was the best. but when i started collecting the series on vhs,and years later on dvd part of bandai's anime legends collections. it was amazing,and truly worth watching. it had a lot of exploding action that will blow you out of your seat. and of course,the theme songs ""just communication"",and rhythm emotions"" were the best.  characters,and gundams: my favorite characters in the show were:heero,duo,relena,treize,lady und,noin,and zechs. my favorite gundams in the show that i liked the most are the wing zero,and epyon,and of course the altron,and deathscythe i,and ii.  meaning of the show: what this series also tells us that in real life,wars are very hard and we can sometimes win,or lose. but peace can also be hard to obtain,and i do believe the gundam pilots are doing the right thing,and are trying to obtain world peace.  but however,this show is truly the best of the best. so in closing to this review,after you watch this show,see the movie endless waltz.",1

"final score: 1.8 (out of 10)  after seeing 'jay and silent bob strike back' i must have been on a big eliza dushku kick when i rented this movie. 'soul survivors' is a junk ""psychological thriller"" dressed up like a trashy teen slasher flick - even to the point of having a masked killer stalk a cast of young up-and-comers like dushku, wes bentley (american beauty), casey affleck (drowning mona) and likable star melissa sagemiller. luke wilson is also in there, ridiculously miscast as a priest. the movie, the brainchild of writer/director stephen carpenter, seems like a mutant offspring of 'open your eyes' or 'vanilla sky' and movies where a character (and the audience) is caught in a world of dillusion caused by an accident/death. the movie keeps churning out perplexing images and leaves us in a state of confusion the entire running time until this alternate reality is finally resolved. i don't think these movies are that entertaining- by their very nature- to begin with, but 'ss' is rock-bottom cheap trash cinema any way you slice it. the visuals, the script, the acting and the attempt at any originality all are throwaway afterthoughts to movies like this. plus, it's pg-13 so it doesn't even deliver the gore or t&a to sustain it as a guilty pleasure (even the unrated version is tame). i had heard that the movie contained some ""hot"" shower scene between dushku & sagemiller. as the movie fell apart in front of me and all other entertainment seemed to be lost i found myself waiting patiently for the shower scene - at least i would get something out of this. then it comes: the two girls get paint on their shirts, they jump in the shower fully clothed and scrub it off. that's it. people thought this was hot? 'soul survivors' is one of those drop-dead boring movies that is so weak and inept that it is hard to have any feelings at all toward it. it puts out nothing and is hardly worth writing about. in the end it leaves us empty. carpenter's finale is a mess of flashing light and pounding sound and that's probably the most lively part. it will no doubt be making the rounds as a late night staple on usa or the sci-fi channel, due to it's low cost and pg-13 rating - and that's probably best for it.",0
"anna (ursula andress) is brought in as an official r.n. by ex-lover benito varotto (duilio del prete), ostensibly to nurse an aging widower, count leonida bottacin (mario piso), back to health after a heart attack. but benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen, including american entrepreneur mr. kitch (jack palance), with ulterior motives, reflected by what anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the count. he has a history of, well, liking women, and would be actually a bit more ""vulnerable"" as he is cured. the bad guys get derailed as anna does not go along and grows closer to the count. the ending might be said to be ironic, but it is probably better described as predictable.   but so much for plot--this film is totally an erotic comedy, from start to finish, and oh how good. there are many nude scenes, including ones of anna and jole, one of the malevolent heiresses, played by luciana paluzzi. both ursula and luciana are noteworthy continental ex-bond women, and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers. as she did in thunderball (remember fiona volpe), luciana plays a femme fatale, sort of, although less elegantly.  perhaps the best scene is anna's (slow) complete strip and jump in bed with the young adone, the ""other patient"" (who incredibly is resisting), in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot. but even at this point she is already two-faced (for the better), for she has decided not to go along. however, benito is more than a two-timer with women, having had lengthy flings in the past with both anna and jole, and the rival best erotic scene follows an invective-filled (to put it mildly) argument between him and jole. this is a standing-up encounter in which luciana is down to black panties only. another nice one is ursula swimming fully naked in the estate's pool. the count is free, as the client, to put his hands wherever he wants to on ursula, and he takes advantage. hey, somehow i've gone back to the actresses' names in my descriptions. erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase. ""the sensuous nurse"" is compact, 77 minutes, but it doesn't need to be--it is enjoyable without interruption, start to finish. definitely recommended.  ",1

"maria braun is an extraordinary woman presented fully and very credibly, despite being so obtuse as to border on implausibility. she will do everything to make her marriage work, including shameless opportunism and sexual manipulation. and thus beneath the vicey exterior, she reveals a rather sweet value system. the film suffers from an abrupt and unexpected ending which afterwards feels wholly inadequate, with the convenience familiar from ending your school creative writing exercise with 'and then i woke up'. it is also book-ended at the other end with the most eccentric title sequence i've ever seen, but don't let any of that put you off.",1

"when i saw this at a shop i thought it looked really good and original. like wolfs creek meets texas chainsaw massacre, and i mean it only cost three quid (around $6). to be honest i don't think it was even worth that.  it seemed like the directors- the 'butcher brothers' couldn't decide whether wanted to do a artsy sort of horror or a gory slasher horror. it ended up with a cliché ridden gory sadistic hour and fifteen minutes with all the characters being one dimensional and you couldn't care less what happened to them but to try to make the audience care about the characters they added a useless monologue at the end and the beginning of the film which to be perfectly honest wasn't needed.  the only good part really was the middle/end- i won't ruin it for you. but that was the only ""good ""part.  overall a pointless watch. it felt like a two hour film but was in fact only 75 minutes. if you want an artsy film-don't bother. if you want a slasher movie- don't bother- the film moves so slowly with nothing ever happening.",0
"oh man, what was sam mraovich thinking? what was anyone who was involved in this ""film"" thinking? mraovich is the head of nearly everything of ""ben and arthur"": director, writer, producer (also executive producer!), caster, lead star- you name it, he did it. and he (mraovich) sucks more than anyone has ever sucked in every department of film making.  so what is wrong with this film? everything. the film is about two gay lovers, ben (jamie brett gabel) and arthur (mraovich- *groan*). ben and arthur want to get married in a world where everyone basically hates gay people. to make things worse, ben's crazy ""ex-wife"" (they don't exactly divorce), tammy (julie belknap) is steaming mad that ben's left her for another man and demands ben that they get back together (saying that she can be gay, too!) and arthur's christian devoted, excessively hypocritical, equally batty as tammy brother, victor, is hell bent on making arthur turn straight and then try to kill him after he gets kicked out of his church.  the film is absolutely chock a block with so many goofs (ie. ben and arthur fly to vermont to get married- they go there on alaska airlines and vermont has palm trees; they fly back on a fedex cargo plane- hope they were comfy in a wooden crate, plus many, many more) and plot holes to boot (victor calls killing arthur ""the final plan"" which later changes to ""the final deed""; arthur and the private (intern) detective drive the same car, blah, blah, blah). the ""actors"" are all very bad and are way, way over the top; the script is laughably horrible(one such example is ""i don't make sense? you don't make sense! i make sense, that's who makes sense!"") and there so much more wrong with the ""movie"" that i can't write them all down.  however, the most laughable yet unbelievable thing about ""ben and arthur"" is that sam mraovich thinks that he has created something that is truly fantastic (see his fake reviews for ""ben & arthur"" and obvious comments by him on youtube.). mraovich is narcissistic and his arrogance blinds him from seeing how awful anything with his name on it really is.  so, to conclude, forget every bad film that you claim is the worst movie ever- ""ben and arthur"" will knock them right off that title, even paris hilton movies look like ""the dark knight"" compared to the monstrosity known as ""ben and arthur"".",0
"as it is often the case, the impressive and explosive trailers of asian films add up to nothing more than lackluster stories. similar to unleashed (which was great,) dog bite dog tells a story where men are raised as ferocious savage dogs that carry out their master's bidding. the main characters, an emotionally undeveloped, amoral killer who is matched against an equally unstable police officer, are far from the common heroes and villains we often see. in fact, by the end, you lose track of who you're supposed to empathize with, failing to feel even the slightest emotion for either of the men  whether that was the failure of the director or perhaps the underlining message he was trying to tell is up to you to decide.  although the beginning of the film was filled with intrigue and unpredictability, by the half-way point it slopped down to a humdrum story of survival and revenge. the suspense which was evident at first soon disappeared because of a grossly mismatched music score which brought down the potentially effective story telling. and in the end, you were left feeling that all that detailed background information and introspection of the main characters was somehow very unnecessary.  on the plus side, the transition in story from point a to point b was quite atypical compared to us movies  so those who aren't familiar with asian films and are tired of hollywood's predictability should check it out.  the white balance seemed off throughout most of the film. it was like looking into a picture shot on fluorescent when it was supposed to be set on tungsten. maybe i'm the only one, but it strained my eyes.  the movie also enjoyed playing tricks on you  an interesting build-up gave me hope for the slow moving story until it was diverted to a low budget, low speed chase scene. and just when you think you were going to get an unanswered indie ending with a mix of shakespearean tragedy, you realize that it's not an ending at all, but rather a transition into a wacky country-music montage about peace and serenity.  throw in some grisly from-behind choke scenes, a moment of redemption unexpectedly brought back into savagery and back again the other way, asians' fascination with bodily fluids and a horrible music score that didn't match the film, and you get the average bland asian thriller.  i just don't get why every fight scene was overlaid with clips of roaring lions i thought they were supposed to symbolize dogs? ultimately, in the end, we are reminded about a true killer that still lurks amongst us  tetanus.  4/10",0
"i just got back from the film and i'm completely appalled. this movie is an absolute mockery to all of mankind. the theatre i was in maybe had 4 other people. this movie was recommended to me and i couldn't believe that this person liked it. i can't believe that any sane human would like it. there was no plot no plot at all. it was a joke. how can you make a movie about nothing. this movie only goes to show why hollywood is in such a shambles. i can only just look at the spiral of the ""horror movie"" industry and giggle. what a travesty to all filmaking, this is true of all the new ""teen horror flicks"" grudge,boogeyman,ring,saw series. it is all such trash. don't support this kind of hogwash!",0
"based on the personal experiences of director john singleton's time at the university of southern california,comes higher learning. a film centered on the racial politics that occur at modern day colleges.  there are three main characters to which the film bases its foundation around for its story: malik williams, an carefree lowbrow athlete who is an african american male. kristin conner, a sheltered soft white girl, and remy, a unsophisticated unconnected white male. all three are overcome by the sudden realities that college life is not as good as it is advertised as all three go through disappointment by being unprepared (malik), by being naive (kristin), and by being unwanted (remy).  one good thing about the film is that it does show that modern american colleges are just high schools writ large. the colleges are not places to build character , develop potential, or enhance personal advancement, but they are institutions used to gather all sorts of students in a one-size-fits-all atmosphere. it is an experience that usually is built for failure for most students. it would have been good if the film built it story about this travesty rather than racial politics.  but it didn't and that's where the films falls apart. singleton ,it seems, had a pretty bad experience at southern california. through this film he lets it all hang out. there is no need to beat around the bush here. singleton lets the heroes and the villains of this piece be easily seen.  the black characters in the film are pretty much seen as the heroes here while all the whites in the film are seen as the villains, save for kristin, who was raped by a fellow white student.  who can understand the inconsistencies of this film? black gang members who come to the aid of a white girl after she points out to them who supposedly raped her? the ease that the black gang members have at the university while a bunch of skin heads meet in a dark small dorm planning violence?   the performances of omar epps (malik) and kristy swanson (kristin) are disappointing. they do seem like the third choices for the roles that they played in this movie (tupac shakur and drew barrymore were supposed to play malik and kristin but were unavailable). o'shea jackson aka ice cube ,busta rhymes, and regina king were all irritating in their respective roles. and laurence fishburne was woefully miscast here as the history professor. only michael rappaport did well in this film and he did considering that his character ,of the three main characters, changed the most in the film.  john singleton wanted to take on the matter of race and inequality in american college life with this film. and he did so quite badly. it was sort like killing a fly with a shotgun. life is far more complex than it seems and people are alike all over and he should know this. higher learning is proof that he did not understand this at all. seeing the film ,then and now, would only confuse, disappoint and enrage the same public he would wish to speak to. not to mention it would not entertain them in the slightest.",0
"the turning point in ""the matador"" comes about half through the movie when danny, an unsophisticated man from denver, is sitting in the balcony of his mexico city hotel, enjoying a quiet moment. someone knocks on his door, and knowing it's julian, the paid assassin, he refuses to answer. but did he really?   richard shephard, the director of ""the matador"", presents us with a character, julian noble, who shows no redeemable qualities. in fact, we have already seen him in action, doing what he does best. when julian meets danny at the bar of the camino real in mexico city, he spills the beans and tells his new acquaintance what he really does for a living.  danny, who has come to sell his program to a mexican company, but it seems he is competing against a local outfit that appears to be in the front for getting the contract. danny is a naive person who falls prey of the charisma and charm doled out by the smarter julian. it's not until some time later, on a cold winter night that the killer appears at danny's door asking his friend to repay a favor and accompany him on a trip to tucson. it's at this point that the secret that binds them together is revealed in an unexpected way.  pierce brosnan, acting against type, makes a great contribution with his irreverent julian noble. just to watch him walking through the hotel lobby in his speedo and boots gives the right impression about his character. greg kinnear, on the other hand, plays the straight part of this odd couple. hope davis appears only in a couple of scenes leaving us to lament why didn't she stay longer. philip baker hall puts an appearance as the liaison between julian and his assignments.  richard shephard directs with style working with his own material. the musical score is by rolfe kent and the crisp cinematography of david tattersall enhances everything.",1
"as a kid i remember being nine or ten and loving this movie. it was the all round bollywood action/comedy movie. it is a imitation of bad boys obviously! the whole swapping identities but the arrival of two other twins throws everything out of the window and then the arrival of colourful villains who dance and sing! the action scenes in the film aren't revolutionary but still amazing scenes. the film is genuinely very funny and was the great comeback amitabh bachan needed. govinda is a gem like always and this is probably his best work to date, he shines as the side kick nd delivers the best comedy scenes available in indian cinema.  the songs....the songs are both funny and catchy..............proving laughs when you least expect it...amitabh bachan surprisingly is very funny and will make you laugh as 'bade miah'....his accent...body language..... brilliant...

"although i am inclined to agree with the other comments made by people who have seen this movie, i am ashamed to say i rather like it. not often can such a huge pile of 80s pap be found outside of a wham! video, so it is most definitely worth a viewing (£0.79 a night in my local store!). watch out for the insanely obvious seams and zip on the monster's costume, the fact that the 'hero' looks a lot like keith chegwin and such classic lines as the following: evil wizard-type bloke: ""at last we meet kor..."" kor: ""thrilling, isn't it?""  amazing!!i also like the fact that although the video box looks quite exciting with images of a castle surrounded by raging seas and a dangerous falcon-like bird carrying a handsome hero to safety (among other such 'interesting and engaging' suggestions of what goes on in the actual film, none of them actually happen. no, i'm not joking...there really isn't a raging sea or a ferocious bird, it's just trying to make you interested...classic in my opinion. this film gets 10 for pure entertainment value!!",1
"de palma's technique had hit its high maturity by the time of this film, which is a wonderful showcase of his classic techniques, though unfortunately, as with many of the films written by de palma himself, the story serves the meta more than the interests of putting forth an emotionally compelling tale.   the story opens with a crazy scene in which angie dickinson masturbates in a shower while she looks at her husband. she is then grabbed and raped while he husband stands obliviously near-and the whole thing is revealed to be angie's fantasy as he husband is pumping mindlessly away at her in bed. she has a short scene with her son, a dead ringer for harry potter, which concludes with a joke that ""she'll tell grandma that he is playing with his peter."" she then goes to her therapy session, where she complains about her dead marriage, before attempting to seduce her therapist, michael caine. he refuses, and she is hurt and feeling unattractive and unfulfilled.  then begins a bravura 22-minute nearly wordless sequence that is perhaps the highlight of the film. among the many things de palma gleaned from hitchcock is the understanding of film as a purely visual medium of telling stories and in typical de palma fashion, he turns this into a way to show off his formidable skill. the problem, for me, is that in this instance one begins to feel that scenes are being needlessly protracted simply to further show off the director's skill.   the sequence begins with angie at an art museum. she watches strangers, all involved in sexual or family activities, then begins to get turned on to a man sitting next to her. de palma very skillfully tells an extremely complicated narrative without a single word about angie's attraction, embarrassment, retreating, and finally finding and submitting to the stranger in the back of a taxi cab, all set to a wonderfully lush score by pino donaggio, who also scored carrie.  in the second part of the sequence angie has slept with the guy, and gets up to return to her husband. again de palma crams a ton of narrative in without a word of dialogue uttered, as angie realizes that she doesn't have her panties, that her husband is already home and no doubt wondering where she is, that she has probably contracted a venereal disease, and that she has lost her engagement ring somewhere in the shuffle. it's all very admirable, but one begins to feel a little strung along as we are forced to do things like take a long elevator ride down from the seventh floor, then up again, almost in real time.  ...spoilers from here on out! when angie reaches the seventh floor again, she is killed by a big woman with blond hair. the woman hacks away at her until she reaches the ground floor, when the door opens and nancy allen sees her there. there is a wonderful slow-motion sequence as nancy reaches into the elevator, angie reaches up toward her, and the killer's blade is held poised to slash nancy's hands. then follow some electrifying shots as nancy looks up and sees the killer in the elevators convex mirror. it's all good, and by the time we have some dialogue again, you think; ""woah, that was just 22 straight minutes of purely visual narrative!"" or maybe you don't, but i do.  a younger dennis franz has a great part as a sleazy and tough new york detective who would rather that everyone else do his work for him. he interviews michael caine, making the outrageous implication (though it passes as commonplace) that angie wanted to be killed. angie's son is there as well, and he hooks up with nancy, and they set about to spy on caine's therapist and find out who the killer is.  once again there is a strong tie to a hitchcock film, in this case psycho (just as obsession is a re-working of vertigo). you have a woman who we are supposed to understand is secretly a slut, who gets killed in the first 30 minutes in an enclosed space, in this case an elevator rather than a shower. then the relatives of the deceased conduct an investigation, which reveals that the killer is a man who dresses as a woman to kill. de palma even throws in a doctor at the end who explains the psychology of the whole thing.   it is very interesting, but at the same time a viewer can begin to feel a bit jerked around, and that is my primary reservation about this film. it is definitely essential viewing and showcases some of de palma's greatest setpieces, but that feeling that the story is running a solid third behind the need for de palma to show off and his somewhat unseemly sexual fantasies makes it hard to look back on this one with whole-hearted affection.  --- check out other reviews on my website of bad and cheesy movies, cinema de merde, cinemademerde.com",1
"where do you begin with a movie as bad as this?  do you mention the cast of unlikeable heroes? the over-the-top acting? the dreadful script?  no. you just say that anyone who pays money to see a film as poor as this needs their head looking at. i know i do. i respect those poor guys who saw it with little or no advance word from mags like empire (usually a bad sign if a preview copy isn't available to the quality movie mags). however, cinemas really should start thinking about giving out refunds if the customer isn't happy with the finished product.  i went three days after it opened with two other mates. the only other person in the cinema was one bloke on his own.  and that was on cheap night.  either the ad campaign had failed dismally or word had spread through most of the country of just what a stinker this is.  not since the days of the avengers (1998) have i felt so short changed since watching a movie. if a mate comes round with this on video in a few months make sure he pays your electricity bill while watching it.  tara fitzgerald deserves an award for not cracking up - or walking off the set; keith allen retains some dignity amid the cinematic carnage; barry foster should have been arrested on the set for his performance, rhys ifans does his career no favours after the success of notting hill and only dani behr is halfway likeable as a busty secretary.  mind you, considering she used to be in the word, any viewers' expectations of her acting ability had to be pretty low to begin with.  the production values aren't bad considering the obviously limited budget but that script is atrocious. if you want to hear a bunch of unlikeable characters say ""fak!"" for a couple of hours then this should be right up your street.  otherwise, bargepoles required.

"no doubt frank sinatra was a talented actor as well as a talented singer. after all, very few actors nowadays can get a scene just right in one take, and that was pretty much sinatra's modus operandi on set.  i feel that as the 1960's wore on, the quality of the man's films really started to tank. the tony rome detective series was nothing short of trying to compete with dean martin's matt helm series which came out at the same time. perhaps even a james bond competition, but nothing really worked for frank during these years. his personal life in shambles, his music fading out...sinatra appeared more like a throwback to the 1950's. the last great sinatra film of this period was probably von ryan's express in 1965.",0
"i've seen this film criticized with the statement, ""if you can get past the moralizing..."" that misses the point. moralizing is in the conscience of the beholder, as it were. this is a decent film with a standard murder mystery, but with a distinct twist that surfaces midway through. the resolution leaves the viewer wondering, ""what would i have done in this position?"" and i have to believe that's exactly what the filmmaker intended. to that end, and to the end of entertaining the audience, the film succeeds. i also like the way that the violence is never on stage, but just off camera. we know what has just happened; it's just not served up in front of us, then rubbed in our faces, as it would be today with contemporary blood and gore dressing. besides, the violence is not the point. the point is the protagonist's moral dilemma, which is cleverly, albeit disturbingly, resolved.",1

"the movie has only one flaw, unfortunately this flaw damages all credibility of the piece.  it starts with the condemnation of the israeli occupation of disputed territories. it fails to address the reason israelis are there. egypt, syria, iraq and jordan attacked israel. this is why israel ""occupys"" their land, because those countries lost it in a war they started.  the film also claims that israel has defied the u n by not complying with resolution 242. problem is, 242 was rejected immediately upon it's inception by.....the palestinians, making it void.  many films are put together well, and can really show footage that changes minds, but remember, when watching anything, believe none of what you hear, and only half of what you see.  all participants in this film are known critics of israel, and some have made many antisemitic public comments, removing any possible credibility to their words.  all participants are in dire need of a actual history lesson taught objectively, not by some palestinian sympathizer.",0
"a group of hunters track down a werewolf, kill it, decapitate it and then sell the head to unethical dr. atwill (played by director/writer tim sullivan), who runs a private clinic specializing in corneal transplants. research chemist rich stevens (mark sawyer), whose eyes were destroyed when acid flew into his face during a lab explosion, is the unlucky recipient of the werewolf's eyeballs. it takes awhile to get to the first full moon, so first we get a tender love story between rich and his compassionate, big-breasted nurse sondra gard (stephanie beaton). sondra is so compassionate that she strips off her clothing and starts riding rich in bed before he even has a chance to remove his bandages! after a month in the hospital, rich returns home to icy wife rita (deborah huber), who promptly tells him ""you look pretty ugly"" before speeding off in her kia. our hero soon discovers that rita is not only a bitch, but an adulterous skank who's been carrying on an affair with his supposed friend craig (lyndon johnson). finally, the full moon rises and rich finds himself in a hairy predicament as he transforms into a (very silly looking) werewolf creature. predictable carnage ensues.  after ripping out craig's throat on a beach, rich wakes up in the brush the next morning with his clothes tattered and vague recollections of the evening's events. he makes friends with dwarf psychic/occult expert andros (kurt levi) and is hassled by both local author siodmak (jason clark) and lesbian-police-detective-in-a-pants-suit justine evers (tarri markel). when rich confronts dr. atwill, the doctor sends his sadistic bald henchman kass (eric mestressat), who gets a kick out of dismembering corpses with a machete at the clinic, after him. with help from sondra, rich manages to escape. sondra takes him back to her place and basically rapes him on the couch during an overlong sex scene that lasts about five minutes. will rich be able to control his lycanthropy or find a cure for it before he claims more victims?   shot on the cheap with a camcorder, this homemade werewolf flick has a somewhat unique premise with the eye transplant angle, but trots out cliché after cliché otherwise. the sets are sub porn level - the clinic scenes seem to have been filmed inside someone's home or apartment. the wolf transformation scenes don't even look as good as the time lapse photography used way back in the 1940s. instead, they employ ragged editing. throw some hair on the actor. cut. throw on some more on. cut. more fur... and fill his mouth full of white gunk he can spit out. cut. no need to worry about continuity! there's no fade, no dissolve, nothing. it's pretty sloppy. once fully transformed, the werewolf costume (designed by jeff leroy, who also edited and shot the movie) is pretty awful. it has red, glowing christmas bulb eyes, fur that looks like shag carpet and a plastic face that's almost completely immobile. there are several times you can see the cameraman's fingers in front of the camera lens, and does the moon really stay full five nights in a row? as far as the cast is concerned, they're amateurish, but tolerable. and as far as b horror flicks are concerned, there are worse out there. this one is paced fairly well, is only 70 minutes long and does provide plenty of the red stuff during the attack scenes, as well as the aforementioned t&a from ms. beaton.  it was produced by david s. sterling (camp blood), who was one of the first to ride the wave of digital video right when it was first starting to dominate the low-budget/independent horror genre scene back in the mid/late 90s. many of his notoriously awful productions were released by brain damage films, a label to avoid like the plague for the most part. fx guy jeff leroy (who is listed as co-director here at imdb, but not in the film's actual credits) and vinnie bilancio (who appears in a small role as one of the hunters) went on to make the much more fun and polished exploitation flick werewolf in a women's prison in 2006, which had a similar-looking creature on display (red glowing eyes and all).",0

"i've read comments that you shouldn't watch this film if you're looking for stirring shakespearian dialogue. this is true, unfortunately, because all the stirring dialogue, this wonderful play contains, has been cut, and replaced with songs. i've read this play, and recently was lucky enough to see it performed, at it remains one of my favourite shakespearian comedies, but this movie seems to take all that i like about it away. the princess, though no doubt doing what she was directed to do, had no regal bearing, and all the girls seemed to lose the cleverness of their characters - also affected by unwise cuts, which not only took away the female characters already sparse dialogue, but took comments out of context - it was a little unnerving to hear the princess proclaim; ""we are wise girls to mock our lovers so!"", when mocking had not taken place at all. the news reels throughout the film also disrupted the flow, and took away many excellent scenes, as they showed the information in the scenes after them, and were in modern phrasing. in conclusion, an excellent play, ruined by an odd concept, and unwise cuts. kenneth, i usually love what you do. what were you thinking?",0

"first off, let me say that i am a great believer in fanpro stuff. i see it as a way to continue a good show long after it has been cancelled. star trek voyages and star wars revelations are examples of decent efforts. so i have a soft-spot for fanpro stuff that means i'll overlook things that i would ordinarily slate badly.  so on to st: hf. well, first off the good things. enthusiasm is a major part of making any show believable and, for the most part, the crew of the various ships all seem to be having a good time with their roles. next, the effects aren't bad for a home-brew effort, with nothing to make you really wince. the stories aren't too bad either. nothing particularly innovative, but solid enough stuff and at least there are ongoing story-arcs.  but it has a lot of faults.  first off, although they quite obviously have to rip-off star trek footage, set backdrops, music and effects, i see no reason why they proceeded to rip off virtually every other sci-fi musical score ever made. everything from aliens to starship troopers rears it orchestral head at one point or another. likewise, much of the footage is from other movies, dutifully cgi'd over to make it look different. the grey warships, for instance, though disguised, are quite obviously star destroyers from star wars. and the station is also rather obviously fleet battle station ticonderoga from starship troopers. likewise, sound effects from various star wars movies appear in space battles between fighters, as does animated over footage. in one scene in either first or second season, i think, you even see two tie fighters fly past during a battle, which hardly does your suspension of disbelief any favours.  acting varies from the reasonable to the hideously painful to watch. everyone does improve as the seasons progress, though, but expect to grimace at the screen a lot, especially in the early seasons. they've also made some interesting acting choices. let's just say that the food replicators on this show seem permanently set to ""cake"" and leave it at that.  make-up effects are generally quite effective on the whole. but they really ought to mercilessly club to death the person who decided to use cheap ferengi and cardassian masks for anything other than background use or ""passing"" shots. they are just beyond unrealistic. every time i saw one of these (apart from trying not to laugh too much) i kept expecting the unfortunate soul wearing it to pull out a gun and announce that ""this is a stick-up!"" in one scene a ""cardassian"" actually talks whilst wearing one of these. not only do the lips not move, but the mask doesn't even have an opening where the mouth should be. someone needs to be slapped hard for that. couldn't they have taken a craft knife to it, for goodness' sake! there are also some well-done, but unintentionally funny make-up jobs, such as the herman munster look alike.  the writing, though coherent, is nothing new. instead the script runs like a continuation of ds9, with the ships heading out from ds12 on various missions. the new enemy, ""the grey"" aren't very menacing and the plot line involving them is effectively a reworking of the borg threads. i.e. starfleet meet the grey, the grey are hugely powerful, starfleet barely escape with their lives, then through technology they begin to find ways to combat the enemy etc etc. all done before with the borg.  another bone of contention is the dialogue. star trek writers have long had the ability to write ""insert technobabble here"" into a script. it usually means an exposition of the latest plan to combat the enemy using ""quantum phase discriminators"" or ""isolytic charges"" etc. in other words, nonsense that tells you that they are on the case and a resolution is at hand.  the words are just gibberish really. i've no problem with this, but where st:hf makes a mess of it is where they include real-world comments into this concept.  tactical advice such as ""we need to regroup"" sounds good, but not when uttered by trio of characters already standing in a group. likewise when asked what the situation is, a tactical officer is heard to reply ""we count three battleships"". he actually needed to count them? c'mon! i expected the questioner to ask him ""are you sure?"" or ""can you double check"". but my all-time favourite comment is this:   captain: ""can we establish two-way communication?""  comms officer: ""no, we can only send and receive..""  well, duh!.....  having said all the above, the show does improve as it goes along. seasons 1 and 2 are pretty bad, 3 shows an improvement but 4 & 5 are where it starts to get noticeably better. season 6 so far looks quite reasonable.  i do have a problem with their choice of media for the shows though. quicktime sucks, quite frankly and the sooner they move to divx/avi format the better. some of us like to actually take our downloaded shows and watch them on decent size screen and not peer at a tiny qt window on a computer monitor. not only does quicktime make this difficult, but the 320x180 resolution the shows are in does not scale at all well. in fact, it makes the shows pretty unwatchable, like they were a tenth-generation vhs tape copy. the least they could do was to include a hi-res downloadable option.  anyway, the show has promise, and i'm even beginning to like some of the characters. but that's 40 episodes on, so i'm not sure this says that much about character development at all.  but what can you say, it's free....  ps: out of 28 votes, 19 people rated this show as a 9 or 10. hmmmm... were we watching the same show? or are you 19 all three year olds?",0
"following the success of ""paris, je t'aime"", a group of directors decided to get together and make a similar anthology style film based in new york. unlike the original film, the stories in this film seem to sometimes come and go too quickly--by the time you think are getting into a story, it's over in too many cases. and, the often start up and stop and then begin again--with the stories woven together. as a result, there is no title to indicate that a story is complete and it is less formal in structure.  sadly, however, while ""paris, je t'aime"" was hit or miss (mostly hit), most of ""new york, i love you"" was miss. the stories tended to be much more sexual in nature but also far less sweet--and often quite terrible. it was an amazingly dull and uninteresting film with only a few exceptional stories--and perhaps the often depressing music made it seem more so. now understand, it was good quality music but its somber tone really, really made me feel like cutting my wrists! among the better ones was the story about the young man who took a girl in a wheelchair to prom, the couple talking about cheating outside a restaurant (though this was also in the first film) and the crotchety old couple. this is all so sad because i had loved the first film so much--and i really wanted to love this film. i respected what they tried but simply didn't like it very much.  by the way, and this is not really a complaint, but i was amazed how many people were smoking in the film. for a recent film, that was unusual in our more anti-smoking culture.  also, if you get the dvd, there are two segments included as extras that were not included in the film. one consists of kevin bacon (wearing a cool fedora) eating a hotdog....and absolutely nothing more for almost ten minutes. the other features a teen who spends the film videotaping the world--including a very unhappy couple.",0
"i don't buy kung fu movies for a plot. i buy them for fight scenes. a bad plot can be forgiven for excellent fight scenes, but not the other way around.  the story was decent, but moved too slowly for my tastes. there were about 3 or 4 mediocre fight scenes throughout, lasting only a couple of minutes apiece. the last fight was a bit longer, but by that point i was so bored i didn't even pay attention to it.",0
"let me start by saying that i totally agree with the basic thesis of the film, that there probably was no historical jesus and christianity is a sham. with that said, this movie does a pretty poor job of proving that thesis. it makes good arguments--the gap between jesus' theoretical life and the writing of the gospels, filled only by the writings of paul, who doesn't indicate a historical jesus--and then utterly fails to convincingly argue them. it makes broad statements without presenting the evidence the statements are based on, and it resolutely ignores counter-arguments presented by christian apologists. the intellectual dishonesty, emotional manipulation, and lack of serious argument are obvious, and stunning. the only christians we hear from in the film are the head of the filmmaker's old school--who comes off like a reasonable, rational person attempting to deal with a twit with a chip on his shoulder--and various christians encountered apparently at random in a parking lot. i'm sorry, but revealing that average christians don't know much about their religion isn't exactly damning evidence of christianity's fraudulence. you may as well claim that jay leno has disproved the existence of michael dukakis on his jay-walking segment. the interviews with experts can be interesting, but the film is filled with too much of, let's be honest, the filmmaker just being snarky. within the first five minutes the film has already conflated jerry falwell with charles manson and the writers of the left behind series with the branch davidians. and by the end, the film becomes so self-centered that there's no rational argument left, just an angry former christian lashing out at the people and places he blames for his messed up childhood. y'know, maybe that movie could've been interesting, but it's misplaced in a documentary about the historicity of jesus, and it's so self-congratulatory as to deflate any sympathy. this is a michael moore film without the humor or the film-making acumen combined with a richard dawkins book without the wit or the intellectual rigor. skip it.",0
"if todd sheets were to come out and admit that this movie was intended to spoof the zombie genre, i would change my rating to an eight. try to imagine a movie where every scene, line, and even every acting nuance was designed to be a parody. i could probably crap out alphabet soup, rearrange what was left of the letters, and still have a better script. two scenes in particular come to mind when i think of this movie. spoiler alert! one is when mike's dad and the other dad walk, i repeat walk down a staircase jam packed with zombies. this is a small staircase and even though they brush up against the flailing undead, nothing happens to them. when they reach the end, the ex-marine turns around, says ""god you're a horny bastard"", and shoots only one. the other is in the military complex. the girl stabs a zombie with a machete and is immediately surrounded. the camera moves around her for roughly forty seconds, while she is surrounded by zombies at an arm's length away. she then almost casually runs out from the crowd and joins the other humans. spoiler alert over! these scenes must be seen to be believed. still, i enjoy this movie as much as almost any comedy just because it's so damn funny. kudos to todd sheets for getting so many people in his movie and having the drive to make it but not really for anything else.",0
cameron grant is one of the best directors doing adult films. his only rival is andrew blake. celeste is dynamite all thru the movie but the dr's office sequence with her & two other ladies is just incredible. nearly as good is asia carrera's performance with the construction worker. i highly recommend this movie & gave it a 9. it's almost as good as cameron grant's elements of desire which i gave a 10.,1
"i have bought the dvd of this version to compare against the current bbc 2005 version (which is brilliant). the 1985 was adapted by arthur hopcraft, who adapted tinker tailor soldier spy for tv and who died this year (2005). i remember great acting, especially from rigg and elliott, and moving music. (music in the 2005 version is far more understated, but very telling.) just to pick up other commentators on a couple of points: richard carstone is ada claire's boyfriend, not esther's. esther had no uncle. charlie drake never played krook in either version, nor did he play toby esterhase in ttss! krook is played by comedian johnny vegas in the 2005 version. toby was played by bernard hepton.  both versions are honourable and admirable adaptations of dickens' great novel. now read the book! it's not perfect, and the sentimentality may make you wince at times, but i defy you not to cry - and laugh!",1
"midnight cowboy made a big fuss when it was released in 1969, drawing an x rating. by today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an r rating. jon voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as joe buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in new york city. he meets a seedy street hustler named ratso rizzo, who tries to befriend buck for his own purposes. the two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. as ratso, dustin hoffman simply shines. hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. he is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. losing the academy award to john wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences. director schlessinger has a deft hand with his production, but this film has a grungy underbelly that leaves a bad taste in the mouth of the viewer. worth seeing for hoffman's performance alone.",1
"every child experiences trauma growing up and every child's active imagination has gotten the best of them, but for jake (anthony de marco  of the forthcoming clint eastwood film changeling - who resembles henry thomas circa 1982) the combination may prove deadly.   a lonely six year old whose imagination kicks into high gear when he is crestfallen to learn his quarrelling parents peter (sean bridgers, late of ""deadwood"") and jules (brooke bloom, ""cbs: miami"") suddenly decide to divorce, leaving him to his own devices and unleashing a new tenant  a zombie in his closet.  jake actually gets this seed planted while playing with neighborhood friend dillon (matthew josten) who provides him with a print out off the internet of faq re: zombies. jake is so convinced that one is out to get him  and his family  he begins to hatch a plan of action to protect them before it's too late.  indie newcomer shelli ryan  who wrote and directed  blends domestic drama with underlings of horror but the former (smartly) outweighs the latter, with a decent story buoyed by fine acting(de marco is the rare breed of child actor where he is a child and not 'acting' - all his nuances are very evident of the awkward, shy, introverted child that many can relate too (i certainly can). bridgers makes his cheating husband empathetic in the realization he really loves his son while bloom has the more difficult job of building sympathy as the somewhat lackadaisical mother who is quick to emotions over rationality  it doesn't help when dillon's mother ruth (monette magrath, who resembles laura dern) is constantly feeding her implied information driving a wedge between jake and his dad. magrath also has a tough task to make her manipulative character relatively likable but she proves to in a revealing scene that i won't go into detail but shows why she is the way she is (and more importantly how she has also affected her own child).  the fillmmaker's subjective camera is also well employed (many angles shown form jake's pov at waist-level or somewhat skewed; i.e. the upside down shot of peter carrying his son in the same position while having some fun in the backyard), and the editing is relatively flawless.   ryan based the screenplay on personal experiences growing up and also witnessing first hand account of a friend going through the same situation and how the affects of adult relationships can be harmful if inflicting their fears, anger and stress onto their children. here the film is very successful in getting its theme across.  however the horror underpinnings are a little disjointed to say the least but the homage to george a. romero's zombie films are shown lovingly by ryan (jake's mom is asleep in front of the tv as night of the living dead unspools, causing his own belief of the undead to be in their home). the metaphor of a monster acting as surrogate to domestic abuse may be a bit heavy-handed but again, the child's fear of a thing under his bed is universal.",1
"the snobs and pseudo experts consider it ""a far cry from de sica's best"" the ones suffering from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem connecting to this masterpiece. de sica spoke in a very direct way. his italianness doesn't have the convoluted self examination of modern italian filmmakers, or the bitter self parody of pietro germi, the pungent bittersweetness of mario monicelli, the solemnity of visconti or the cold observation of antonioni. de sica told us the stories like a father sitting at the edge of his children's bed before they went to sleep. there is no attempt to intellectualize. miracolo a milano and in a lesser degree il giudizio universale are realistic fairy tales, or what today we call magic realism. the film is a gem from beginning to end and toto is the sort of character that you accept with an open heart but that, naturally, requires for you to have a heart. cinema in its purest form. magnificent.",1
"the worst, and chock full of people who really ought to know better, (the cast have six oscars between them). it's set in 'contemporary' africa, (it was made in 1979), and is about the slave trade. it's appallingly scripted and acted, (michael caine, peter ustinov and william holden reach a career low in this one), and completely lacks excitement never mind any moral focus. it's also ludicrously plotted. you don't for a minute believe that any of the characters would behave in the way they do under these circumstances. richard fleischer directs but you get the impression it was over the telephone. this is as bad as it gets.",0
"this movie is like real life, by which i mean - not a lot happens in the available 2 hours or so, and not much game plan or plot is evidenced by the frequently invisible cast (their invisibility being due to the ""experimental"" lighting as mentioned by many reviewers).   a big bore. no big surprise that altman helms this - he is a very variable performer (yes we all loved ""gosford park"", but ""pret a porter"" anyone? kansas city? dr t. and the women? aaargh), but the fact that the raw material is a john grisham tale, and the excellent cast that you will perceive through the gathering gloaming of your insistent slumber - makes this truly a masterpiece of bad film. and no, it is not ""so bad it's good"".  it's just bad.",0
"after not having much luck at selling his screenplays to the new movie industry during the first decade of the 20th century, in 1908 playwright d.w. griffith got the job that would make him a legend: he was hired by the biograph company as a director of movies. it wasn't really what griffith had expected when he decided to enter the movie business, but he accepted the job, and in less than a year he became biograph's most successful director thanks to his original approach to film-making and the wild inventive of his narrative. many years later, he would direct ""the birth of a nation"" in 1915, the movie that would revolutionize film-making and make him one of cinema's first recognized authors; however, a lot of what would make him a great filmmaker can be found in the many short films he made for biograph company in the early years of his career. 1909's ""the sealed room"" is one of those, and also one of the few horror movies of that very first decade of the 20th century.  ""the sealed room"" is a story set in the 16th century in which a count (arhtur v. johnson) has built a windowless room in his castle. it is a small yet nice and very cozy room, as it is meant to be used to enjoy the love and company of his wife, the countess (marion leonard) in a more private way. however, the count doesn't know that his wife is not exactly faithful, as she is infatuated with the minstrel (henry b. walthall) at court, with whom she is having an affair. as soon as the count gets busy with his own business, the countess calls the minstrel and both lovers go to enjoy the count's new room. when the count returns, he discovers she is missing and begins to suspect, finally discovering the two lovers in his room; but instead of making a scene, he prefers to remain hidden as he decides that there is a better punishment for his unfaithful wife: to seal the windowless room with the couple inside.  written by griffiths' regular collaborator frank e. woods, ""the sealed room"" takes elements from edgar allan poe's ""the cask of amontillado"" and mainly honoré de balzac's ""la grande breteche"" to create a haunting gothic melodrama based on the themes of treachery and sadism. despite having a runtime of 11 minutes, woods' screenplay develops the story in a very good way, and plays remarkably well with the horror elements of the story. while a melodrama at heart, woods focus on the character of the count and his sadism creates one of the best horror characters of these early era. ""the sealed room"" is definitely a very simple and basic story, but woods handling of the dark and morbid thematic of its plot makes the story a very entertaining film that was very different than most griffith's melodramas.  in ""the sealed room"", griffith uses his talents to experiment with tension and suspense in a different way than his usual. while he often played with editing to create thrillers that excited his audience, in this movie his focus was to create desperation and horror, playing with the inherent feeling of claustrophobia that the source stories had. it is interesting how the story starts as another of his melodramas and slowly the pacing becomes faster as the horror themes begin to dominate the plot, culminating in his great use of editing for the final scenes. not being a movie where camera tricks are essential, what shines the most in ""the sealed room"" is griffith's talent to direct his actors, as the legendary filmmaker manages to bring the best out of his cast with his usual natural style far removed from the staginess that was the norm in his day.  as usual, the cast was comprised of usual collaborators of griffith, starting with arthur v. johnson as the count. johnson gives a great performance and truly conveys the character's transition from loving husband to sadistic monster. his performance is not without a touch of overacting, but actually that adds realism to the character's exaggerated personality. as the countess, marion leonard looks very good and is also very effective in her acting, conveying a natural charm that makes hard not to sympathize with her in her treachery. finally, the legendary henry b. walthall appears as the handsome minstrel, and while far from being one of his best performances, he manages to give a proficient acting that also adds a nice touch of comedy to the film. while not of real importance to the plot, it's nice to see other members of griffith's stock company in the background, like his wife linda arvidson and a young mary pickford as nobles at court.  while not exactly a masterpiece, ""the sealed room"" is a notable exercise of editing to create suspense and tension like griffith used to do in those days. the movie has very good set design and while of a very low budget, griffith's care for details makes it look very convincing and works perfectly along with his directing style. the change of focus to horror makes it to stand out among other of his films from that era, and johnson's performance as the sadistic count makes it worth a watch. while griffith will always be remembered for his highly influential (and controversial) ""the birth of a nation"", the early short films he made before it really give a good idea of the development of the techniques and the style that would make him a legend. simple yet elegant, ""the sealed room"" is a fun movie to watch and one of the few horrors of the first decade of the 20th century. 7/10",1

"the funky, yet strictly second-tier british glam-rock band strange fruit breaks up at the end of the wild'n'wacky excess-ridden 70's. the individual band members go their separate ways and uncomfortably settle into lackluster middle age in the dull and uneventful 90's: morose keyboardist stephen rea winds up penniless and down on his luck, vain, neurotic, pretentious lead singer bill nighy tries (and fails) to pursue a floundering solo career, paranoid drummer timothy spall resides in obscurity on a remote farm so he can avoid paying a hefty back taxes debt, and surly bass player jimmy nail installs roofs for a living. former loving groupie turned patient, understanding, long-suffering manager juliet aubrey gets the group back together for an ill-advised, largely ineffectual and hilariously disastrous twenty years later nostalgic reunion tour of europe. our lovably ragged bunch try gamely, but fumblingly to reignite a flame that once burned quite brightly back in the day. scraggly zonked-out roadie billy connelly and cocky eager beaver young guitarist hans matheson tag along for the delightfully bumpy, trouble-plagued, but still ultimately rewarding and enjoyable ride.  director brian gibson shows tremendously infectious respect and adoration for both his amiably screwy characters in particular and loud, ringing, flamboyantly overblown preening 70's rock in general, this imbuing this affectionate little pip with an utterly engaging sense of big-hearted charm and tireless verve. the astute, sharply written script by dick clement and ian la frenais likewise bristles with spot-on dry wit and finely observed moments of joyous on the road inanity, capturing a certain bittersweetly affecting and frequently uproarious vibe that gives the picture itself an irresistibly luminescent glow. ashley rowe's lovely, elegant cinematography ensures that the movie always looks quite visually sumptuous while the perfectly catchy and groovy music does the trick with right-on rockin' flair and aplomb. kudos also to the across-the-board terrific performances that vividly nail the burnt-out soul and tattered, but still fiercely beating heart of a past its prime has-been ragtag rock outfit desperate to regain its erstwhile evanescent glory in one final bid for big time success. all in all, this radiant and touching gem rates highly as one of the true seriocomic sleeper treats from the 90's.",1

"all of the x-men movies were great. and i mean all of them, including the long hated x-men 3. they had solid characters (magneto and xavier were the best ones, in my opinion), and a good story arch.  i was all excited when i heard this movie was on production, and my expectations grew bigger and bigger until i saw the movie. i was so disappointed.  hugh jackman is not a bad actor (his best movie is the fountain, although you won't hear about this movie when they talk about the actor), and his acting is not what screws the movie up.  the whole film is plagued with lots of meaningless characters that add nothing to the plot (like blob or gambit), which were tossed there to make fans believe that the film makers had read the original comics.  i am a fan of xmen, i have read many, many of their stories and this movie respected none of them. none. not even the continuity. it doesn't respect weapon x project, or the relationship between wolverine and sabretooth, or emma frost, the motivations for wolverine are plain stupid and seen in millions of movies: revenge for the death of a loved one.  oh. what i was expecting the whole darn movie was a berseker moment for wolverine similar to the one he has in x2 in the school when stryker men come in and he alone decimates the enemy forces, but hey, this is fox, this a family flick and you will not see explicit violence from the most violent and gruesome marvel hero.  besides, i had a feeling of constant dejá vù with this movie because wolverine's origins are already explained in x2, we already know how he got his adamantium skeleton so it kind of does not make sense to make a movie of something we already know.  i personally believe that wolverine is one of those few characters that does not need a solid back-story because mystery is the nature of the character. do we really want to know how the joker got his scars?",0

"this is a very funny movie, easy to watch, that entertains you almost all the time. the work of the director is recognizable and the type of humor is his trademark. the movie is a typical police partners history like lethal weapon, but the jokes and comedy are of argentinian sort. the twist is that one of them is a psychologist played by peretti and has to go with detective diaz (played by luque) on his assignments while he also assist him (diaz is troubled because his wife cheated on him). some of the dialogs are hilarious worldwide: understandable and laughable anywhere. is very good overall, it would deserved an 8, but i rated 7 because it gets a little down at the end. on a personal remark i must add that is a ""bravo"" for argentinian filmmakers, considering the little good is coming lately.",1
"a major moneymaker for rko radio, bombardier stars pat o'brien and randolph scott as trainers at a school for bomber pilots. o'brien and scott argue over teaching methods, while their students vie for the affections of anne shirley. o'brien's methods prove sound during a bombing raid over tokyo. scott and his crew are captured and tortured by the japanese, but the mortally wounded scott manages to set fire to a gas truck, providing a perfect target for his fellow bombardiers. stylistically, bombardier is one of the most schizophrenic of war films, with moments of subtle poignancy (the death of trainee eddie albert) alternating with scenes of ludicrous ""yellow peril"" melodrama (the japanese literally hiss through their teeth as they torture the helpless americans). though it can't help but seem dated today, bombardier remains an entertaining propaganda effort (the film is sometimes erroneously listed as the debut of robert ryan, who'd actually been appearing before the cameras since 1940.  anyone interested in obtaining a copy of this film, please contact me at: iamaseal2@yahoo.com",1
"radiofreccia is a movie about all of us, about our dreams, our friends, our obsessions, our addictions, our fears. it is a brilliant movie where a group of friends like all of us have lives through the hardships of growing up in a small town in one of the most significant decades in the last century. the movie doesn't take a happy or sad approach on things, it just tells us a story, one that all of us could have experienced. one of happiness and excitement, sadness and grief. the power of this story is in that we grow to love the characters, it is one of those movies you will watch over and over again, feeling closer to the little town in emilia romagna where it takes place. hoping one day to be able to finally walk its streets next to freccia and his friends, listening to the music that changed the world through the crackling sound of an old radio playing radio raptus international, playing their dreams, our dreams. radiofreccia will make you laugh, it will make you cry at times, it will shock you and comfort you, it will give you and take from you. personally i believe it to have played an important part in my life, and that of my friends, and i suggest you all watch it and let it become part of yours.",1
"i saw this movie originally in the theater, when i was 10. even at that age the 'humor' was mildly insulting to my adolescent intelligence.  in the past, whenever i would see ed begley jr. or jeff goldblum i would cringe and start to feel very uncomfortable and even slightly sad. until i was reminded of the existence of this movie today, i was unsure why i felt that way. apparently i blocked my memory of this movie yet my negative feelings towards two of the perpetrators remained. apparently i forgot that i saw this movie but subconsciously mourned the pieces of my soul that had been stolen, nay eaten by the creators of this inhuman work.  i haven't been brave enough to try watching it as an adult. i imagine that as part of the healing process that i should probably look at confronting this childhood fear so that i can *truly* put it behind me. some regression therapy and / or hypnosis might not be a bad idea either.",0
"bacall does well here - especially considering this is only her 2nd film. this one is often overshadowed because it falls between 2 great successes: ""to have and to have not"" (1944) and ""the big sleep"" (1945), both of which paired her with humphrey bogart. granted this one is not up to par to the other movies but i think through no fault of her own. i think there was some miscasting in having her portray a british upper-crust lady. no accent whatsoever. i think all the strange accents were distracting - boyer was certainly no spaniard. it was hard to keep straight which country people were from.  i really liked the black and white cinematography. mood is used to great affect - i especially liked the fog scene. the lighting also does a great job of adding to the intrigue and tension.  bacall is just gorgeous. boyer just doesn't fit the romantic leading man role for me - so he and bacall together was a little strange. not great chemistry - and certainly no bogie and bacall magic. but i still really liked this picture. there is great tension and it moves along well enough. i must say i found the murder of the little girl quite bold for this period film.  katina paxinou and peter lorre stand out as supporting cast. paxinou as the hotel keeper is absolutely villainous and evil in her portrayal. her one scene where she laughs maniacally as mr. muckerji is leaving after exposing her as the child's murderer is quite disturbing. lorre also does quite well in his slimy, snake portrayal of conteras - a sleazy coward to the end. wanda bendrix also does quite well in portraying the child else - especially considering this was her first picture and she was only 16 at the time (though she appears much younger). turns out she later married auie murphy which proved to be a short lived, tempestuous marriage.",1
"**spoilers contained**  i'd heard from various sources that this film was controversial and that the ending in particular was horrific. what i didn't expect was the complete change in tack with about twenty minutes to go. what starts off as a typical cowboy/indian western suddenly descends into a very dull romantic 'comedy' about honus (soldier blue of the title played by peter strauss) and cresta (candice bergen) who escape an onslaught of the cavalry by the cheyenne. the majority of the film then focuses on these two mismatched people hence the romantic comedy bit. donald pleasance then turns up and abducts them both for no real apparent reason. they then escape and both turn up (separately) at the cavalry base on the eve of an attack on the cheyenne base. as cresta used to be married to one of the cheyenne chiefs she escapes the cavalry base and joins up with them. so far so ordinary. then comes the ending. after enduring well over an hour of poor acting involving a cliched will they/won't they get together storyline, the movie then transforms into over the top exploitation involving among other things a decapitation and a child being shot in the back of the head. similarities can be drawn with the wild bunch at this point of the film but the wild bunch kept the same tone throughout and didn't resort to extreme gratuitous violence. in some ways, soldier blue reminds me of frank perry's last summer which also completely changed tack for a shock ending. i didn't hate soldier blue nor find the ending particularly disturbing but just found it to be pretty dull with an unnecessarily violent ending. if you want to see a film with a truly disturbing slaughter of the innocents, i would recommend elem klimov's come and see.",0
"some of the worst, least natural acting performances i've ever seen. which is perhaps not surprising given the clunky, lame dialog given to the one note characters. add to that the cheap production values and you've got a movie that doesn't look like it even belongs on television. one doesn't expect much from a lifetime movie, especially one this old, but this is nearly unwatchably bad.  plot-wise, it's a dreadful, clichéd romance of a type even harlequin would consider beneath them. it's possible to guess how the remainder of the movie will go by simply watching the opening couple of scenes. surprise, the only female character who gets any focus and the mysterious stranger end up falling in love.",0
"this particular joe mcdoakes short subject was obviously inspired by the all star warner brothers spectacular thank your lucky stars, one of those all star wartime morale boosters of the period. in that one eddie cantor played both himself and a would be comedian who'd like to break into films except for his resemblance to cantor.  george o'hanlon who starred in the mcdoakes shorts is both himself and mcdoakes who's just trying to get a break in film. like thank your lucky stars a few warner brothers contract players with a free moment strolled through this film.  o'hanlon's been sent by central casting for a small one line role in a world war i film, but lookalike mcdoakes gets the message. the poor guy is so nervous about his big moment, he starts thinking of ways to deliver his one line. maybe sounding like a real movie star would help.  86 takes later to the exasperation of director ralph sanford and the patient clyde cook who plays a british cockney soldier they do find a niche in the film business for poor mcdoakes. it's worth seeing this very funny short subject which was nominated for an oscar to find out what happens to o'hanlon/mcdoakes.  both of them.",1
"""all the world's a stage and its people actors in it""--or something like that. who the hell said that theatre stopped at the orchestra pit--or even at the theatre door? why is not the audience participants in the theatrical experience, including the story itself?  this film was a grand experiment that said: ""hey! the story is you and it needs more than your attention, it needs your active participation"". ""sometimes we bring the story to you, sometimes you have to go to the story.""  alas no one listened, but that does not mean it should not have been said.",1
"and thats about all that is. this thing is slow. the actors have ability, they just don't seem motivated to put forth the effort. the plot isn't that great and is hampered further by the aforementioned slowness of it all. the accents, when there are any, are british. uh, lots of these folks are supposed to be danes. ok, ok, accents aren't that important. but language is. i don't think they used words like ""yeah"" and ""ok"" in beowulf's day. and that supposedly way cool weapon his king gave him? did he ever reload that thing? did he ever sight it in? or was beowulf just that bad an aim? well, his aim did at least match the computer graphics used in generating the monsters. those were rather off too. bad special effects. bright spot? just one that i can think of. marina sirtis has held up well over the years.",0
"in holland a gay writer gerard (jeroen krabbe) gives a lecture. he stays overnight with a beautiful woman christine (renee soutendijk) and has sex with her (by imagining she's a boy). he plans to leave the next day, but gets a look at a picture of christine's hunky boyfriend herman (thom hoffman) and decides to stay to have a try at him. then things get strange.  a big x-rated art house hit in the us in 1983. why was it x rated? let's see...there's strangulation, full frontal male and female nudity, castration, mutilation, simulated sex, a scene in a church with a cross that will shock most people, a gay sex scene in a crypt...and it's all a comedy!!!!! paul verhoeven made this after ""spetters"". ""spetters"" was attacked by the critics for it's extreme sexual sequences and denounced as trash. so, verhoeven filled this film with very obvious symbolism thinking the critics would think it was art and praise it. he was right! critics loved the film not realizing that verhoeven was playing a big joke on them. still, it's a great film.   it's beautifully shot by jan de bont (now a director himself) and there's so much symbolism and obvious ""hidden"" layers in the dialogue that you're never bored. all the acting is great--krabbe plays a thoroughly despicable character but (somehow) has you rooting for him; soutendijk is just stunning to look at and plays her part to perfection--the little smile she gives when gerard agrees to stay with her is chilling; hoffman is extremely handsome with a great body--he deserves credit for doing the church sequence and going at with krabbe in the crypt.  this is not for people easily offended or the weak of heart, but if you like extreme movies that playfully challenge you (like me) this is for you! a 10 all the way.",1
"horrible film. about an old crusty painter who hangs around with a young girl. boring. tatum o neil goes through the motions in her part, and has some of the corniest lines in film history. richard burton looks close to death in this film, and we're supposed to believe he looks ""good for sixty"". the acting is bad, as is the plot. the characters are awful, as is the story. it's really hard to feel for anyone in this film, except larry ewashen who plays a guy in a porno theater who hits on tatum, he's kind of funny. this movie is really a waste of time. if you are a tatum fan, like me - which is why i rented it in the first place - please don't see this movie. she is really bad in it, and you'll wonder if maybe paper moon was a fluke. it wasn't, because of bad news bears and little darlings it's known she can act well, but still, don't rent this movie. and if you're a fan of burton, rent something when he was good looking, and not a fossil.",0

"2003 was seen as the year of the matrix, with the release of two sequels and a computer game that actually linked to the plot of the film. also released was a dvd of 9 short animated films, most written and made in japan and made as anime. japan makes some of the best animation in the world. sadly most of these shorts are disappointing. the best of them is the first part of a prequel to the first matrix film.  the second renaissance is made as a historical file. it tells how humans made machines in their own likeness. humans live the high life whilst machines are the grunts, the workers of society, second class citizens. in the year 2090, a machine, bi-66er was put of trial for murder, after killing his owners who wanted to deactivate him. the machine does not have a fair trial and riots start around the world. the governments of the world order to dismantle machines. many machines leave human society and form their own country in the middle east, o1. 01 has a productive economy and easily undercut the human nations, forcing them into economic crisis. the human blockade 01 and reject the machines requests for peace, thereby it was the humans who were responsible for the war that enslaves them.  the second renaissance is a interesting watch, with excellent, traditional animation style and sets a compelling world. it shows how the machines were mistreated and that humanity sowed the seeds of their own destruction. there is a political and social world and the short tells a lot in it short running time. the short shares themes and a style to the classic silent film metropolis, partly the beginning with the underworld. they are the themes of slavery, the mistreatment of the working class and racism. the short also has some religious themes and religious iconography. mainly that men saw themselves as god and created the machines in their own likeness. seeing themselves as the rightful masters of the machines. the machines too use religious iconography, mainly forming their nation in 'cradle of human civilisation' and the machines coming to the united nations dressed as adam and eve, offering an apple.  the animation style is beautiful, done in the traditional anime style (like akira). the set designs are great, combine futuristic with historic cities, e.g. washington d.c.. there is well down future scene, and surprising violence, which is key to the film. the director, mahiro maeda, also directed the anime sequence in kill bill vol. 1, so has good credentials to hollywood. he is willing to use violence and know how to keep a story going.  the only real complain is a continuity error to the first matrix film because morpheus mentions that the humans have no historical records or know who started the war. but its a good watch.",1

"delightful minor film, juggling comedy and detective, romance and drama genres as nimbly as lt kenny williams (melvyn douglas) balances his devotion to his girl maxine carroll (joan blondell) and his duty to the force as an ace detective.  this hodge-podge may not appeal to all viewers today, but in its day, it had something to offer every member of the movie-going family, and the resolution to the rather tired feeling-versus-duty plot is original and refreshing, and well worth the wait.   ""the amazing mr. williams"" contains what must be among the most outrageous blind dates in film history, and its bright comic repartee sparkles. ludicrously frocked, melvyn douglas delivers some of the best lines: ""i'd walk down main street in a turkish towel before i'd let any woman control my life!"" and the effervescent joan blondell lets her barbs fly with typical aplomb: ""good grief! you look like my aunt nellie!'   the crime-solving here is standard fare, although a fine cast of character actors helps bring the material to life.   from today's vantage point, ""the amazing mr. williams"" is perhaps most interesting for its insightful commentary on gender as a socially defined construct, all the more malleable for its seemingly rigid boundaries. while much of the gender commentary takes place in a superficial battle of the sexes, at times it is both subtle and penetrating, playing out not only in some of the finer details of the film, but in the battle of genres that reaches its culmination in the final scene.",1

"some funny bits, but come bill! a film? quoting zeitgeist? keep the tv show and the interviews, but a film? i'm probably overreacting but what a unnecessary provoking film... i don't know. i laughed, disagreed, agreed... this film is very confusing and inconsistent.  bill's a funny guy... but also very cocky... bill's rhetoric is similar to bill hicks, a brilliant comedian. but like many comedians, the borderline between comedy and preaching can be annoying. i think that the major problem in this film is his lack of sensibility. this might be just a personal taste, but comedy that constantly demeans somebody cannot be taken as truth. bill is obviously emotionally reactive to religious fundamentalism. i agree with bill that religious fanaticism is not sensible, but the response to it cannot be sensible. it will create unnecessary turmoil. we can do better than just react to fundamentalism. his conclusion is that ""we don't know"" and he fervently tries to convince the spectator that nobody knows anything, to the point that the agnostic community has been concerned with his lack of serious research in comparative religion. his humility that he only knows that he doesn't, is a contradiction as he tries to insist that all religious thought is non-sense.  i had great trouble seeing bits of zeitgeist, the movie in bill's film. all the astrotheology-influenced non-sense that simplifies all religions as the same is simply disappointing. zeitgeist has provoked a lot of controversy and has messed up the validity of so much of the valuable religion studies scholarship. it is very sad how wrong facts have been tossed around with no reliable scholarly sources. astro-mystic sources that reduce everything to ""the stars say it all"" seem to be from the middle ages. this film is a confusing statement from a confused ""agnostic"". agnosticism is far more complex and philosophically academic than defending every single issue as ""we don't know"".  this film is an obvious proof of how postmodernism has been able to oversimplify and generalize major issues in human history.  watch the film (it has hilarious interviews and bits) but please do not behave like bill. you cannot expect anybody to have a mature conversation if you are making sardonic comments in every other line. his arguing techniques are demeaning and insulting, provoking emotional reactions rather than rational and logical argumentation.. there needs to be a more mature way of dealing with these issues.",0
"of life in (some) colleges. of course there were artistic licenses taken, but some of what you saw in this film go on in some colleges.  i went to colleges in southern california where the races pretty much hang around with their own. it's funny because these are schools that want racial unity, equality etc. and i can honestly say, that it's there. but the thing is when class lets out, or when they're just hanging out waiting for class, they (students) seem to just hang around with people of their own race or ethnicity. is that bad? not really. everyone needs a feeling of belonging. but like the school paper of one of the schools i attended once wrote about that, ""we should all try to hang around with students of other ethnicities and try to know them."" otherwise you're creating your own segregation.  racism certainly existed in one of those schools i attended. one time someone put leaflets around campus talking about the glories of the aryan race and had the symbols of some of those racist organizations. fortunately, nothing happened like the incident in the movie where the young caucasian man went off and started shooting at a multiculturalism gathering.  i can only hope and pray that nothing like that ever will happen.  so is ""higher learning"" overly dramatic? exaggerated? maybe. is it way ""off mark?"" it depends on where you went to or go to school. the race thing where the ethnicities just hang around with their own does happen. minus the hollywood exaggerations, the race thing hit pretty close to home for me.",1

"an american woman, her european husband and children return to her mother's home in ""watch on the rhine,"" a 1943 film based on the play by lillian hellman, and starring paul lukas (whom i believe is repeating his stage role here), bette davis, lucile watson, george coulouris, geraldine fitzgerald, and donald woods. an anti-fascist, a worker in the underground movement, many times injured, and wanted by the nazis, kurt muller (lukas) is in need of a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. but he finds out that there is truly no escape as one of the houseguests (coulouris) is suspicious as to his true identity and more than willing to sell him out.  great performances abound in this film, written very much to put forth lillian hellman's liberal point of view. it was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time it was released, as the evils of war and what was happening to people in other countries reach into safe american homes. the movie's big controversy today is that paul lukas won an oscar over humphrey bogart in ""casablanca."" humphrey bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous rick, but lukas is transcendent as kurt. the monologue he has about the need to kill is gut-wrenching, just to mention one scene.  though this isn't what one thinks of as a bette davis movie, she gives a masterful performance here as kurt's loyal and loving wife, sara. her acting tugs at the heart, and the love scenes between kurt and sara are beautiful and tender.  the last half hour of the film had me in tears with the honesty of the emotions. lillian hellman is not everyone's cup of tea, but unlike ""the little foxes,"" she has written some truly sympathetic, wonderful characters and a fine story given a casting and production values by warner brothers. highly recommended.",1

"war, inc. - corporations take over war in the future and use a lone assassin brand hauser (john cusack) to do their wet-work against rival ceos. a dark comedy satirizing the military and corporations alike. it was often difficult to figure out what exactly was going on. i kept waiting for things to make sense. there's no reason or method to the madness.  it's considered by cusack to be the ""spiritual successor"" to grosse point blank. i.e., war is more or less a knock-off. we again see cusack as an assassin protecting *spoiler* the person he's supposed to kill as he grips with his conscience. to be fair, john cusack looks kind of credible taking out half a dozen guys with relative ease. the brief fights look good. the rest of the film does not. it's all quirky often bordering on bizarre. war inc's not funny enough to be a parody, and too buoyant for anyone to even think about whatever the film's message might be, which i suppose might be the heartless ways that corporations, like war factions compete and scheme without a drop of consideration given to how they affect average citizens. interesting, but the satire just doesn't work because it's not funny and at its heart the film has no heart. we're supposed to give a damn about how war affects cusack's shell of a character rather than the millions of lives torn apart by war.  john cusack gives a decent performance. his character chugs shots of hot sauce and drives the tiniest private plane but quirks are meant to replace character traits. marisa tomei is slumming as the romantic sidekick journalist. there really isn't a lot of chemistry between them. hilary duff tries a russian accent and doesn't make a fool of herself. joan cusack just screams and whines and wigs out. blech. ben kingsley might have to return the oscar if he doesn't start doling out a decent performance now and again. pathetic.  it's not a terrible movie, but in the end you gotta ask ""war, what is it good for?"" absolutely nothing. c-",0
"i was excited to view a cataluña´s film in the berlin´s competition. but after the presentation i was total disappointed and furious. too much blood, too much time, too much themes for nothing. the spanish civil war, like every war, was horrible. the revenge, a very human behavior, not pretty at all, is shown in uncountable films and plays, as well as the relations between homosexuals and the scepticism in spain about catholicism . but what mr villaronga try, is a pseudo tragedy that can belongs to the worst of the film´s history. it is really a pity to see angela molina in this movie. i advise nobody under no circumstances to go to see this film.",0
"to be honest, i had to go see this movie backwards, didn't expect that much, but hey, i was not deceived, i had a good time.  i would say this movie is way a fresh breeze, despite some facts that they tried to modernize nancy drew, but this made me remember these youth movies of the 60-70s from europe and quebec, where they manage to have children getting interacting with adults. in this case, a 16 year-old teenager tries to do justice by trying to solve a mystery concerning the death of an actress who died 25 years ago. anyway, as her dad had business in hollywood, why not rent a home with a mystery behind doors ? well, at least emma roberts does a great job here. kinda like the chubby kid, who at first is naively brought to support his sister's pranks to nancy, but at the end, found nancy quite cool enough to stick with her, even with her matters...  rest of the supporting cast is great, and was happy to see rachael leigh cook in a different role this time: a single mother (she did it in family rescue, but this time, she plays a mature woman...) anyway, don't dump this, it is fun !",1
"enough is enough...sometimes they just need to stop making movies based on a concept that is long dead. the first tremors movie was great. the second one was ridiculous. the third one was nauseating. the tv series was depressingly awful. and this movie just drives the stake deeper.  basically another excuse for cheap computer effects and puppetry, now we have the series set in the wild west, in the 1800's, and they fight graboids. like a rehash of the first one, they have to learn how to beat them all over again. mildly entertaining i suppose. otherwise this straight-to-video release, just like tremors 2 and 3, is just going way too far. oh and i continue to wonder how there is never any record of these events taking place...did they just simply forget to record this unprecedented event? i think something like this would be history-making, so our pals in the first film wouldn't be so unprepared.   movies like this that ruin the original just make me crazy. avoid this garbage.",0
"there is a certain genius behind this movie. i was laughing throughout. the scene in the phone sex office, discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this genius/humor. execution is poor, but you can see the writer's message and they do have some talent. the doppelganger split at the end was like... ""ok, wasn't quite expecting that but let's see what the movie has to say"". certainly ridiculous, but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange way.  is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level? i'm easily bored by many movies, but this one kept my interest throughout.  i think the story may have some auto-biographical roots, but that's just a guess. horribly bad, but good. i'm looking for other movies this person may have done (with more experience).",1
"a friend of mine recommended this movie, citing my vocal and inflective similarities with des howl, the movie's main character. i guess to an extent i can see that and perhaps a bit more, i'm not very sure whether or not that's flattering portrayal.  this is a pretty unique work, the only movie to which this might have more than a glancing similarity would be true romance, not for the content or the style of filming or for the pace of dialogue (whale music is just so much more, well, relaxed.) but instead that they both represent modern love stories.  in general i'm a big fan of canadian movies about music and musicians (for example i highly recommend hard core logo) and this film in particular. it has an innocent charm, des is not always the most likeably guy, but there's something about him that draws a sterling sort of empathy.",1

"it begins with several of the principles on a stage run to albuquerque. gabby hayes(juke, sounds like duke) is the driver and begins his usual tirade against women in general, with his girlfriend pearl being an exception. he then relates a garbled version of the biblical story of samson to justify his retention of long whiskers against the wishes of pearl, who is the town barber, no less, and who claims if everyone followed his example, she would be out of business. this point will return to dominate the last scene in the film. gabby seems an irritation to some reviewers, but is a definite plus to this one. it's too bad he wasn't in more of the better randoph scott westerns to help lighten up randy's usual iron-jawed demeanor. also on this stage are randy(cole armin), his future wife(cathrine craig , as celia wallace), whom he is getting acquainted with, and a little girl(myrtle), to whom he soon becomes a hero when he rescues her from the runaway stage after it is held up by henchman of randy's wheelchair-bound uncle john armin(george cleveland), who essentially runs the town.  randy soon learns that his uncle, and by extension, himself, is not exactly popular among the town folk. he does, however, quickly form a useful friendship with gabby. after he learns that uncle john was responsible for the stage holdup of his business competitor, celia wallace, and the associated murder, he demands that uncle john return the money and decides to work for celia and her brother ted(russell hayden), instead of for uncle john.   as his rival's prospects rise, uncle john decides to plant an informant(barbara britton, as letty tyler) in the wallace office, to keep him informed as to when they are delivering ore from the mines to town so that he can sabotage their run. when this doesn't work, he resorts to the draconian tactic of staging an arson of his own office, for which randy is blamed. unfortunately, when the fire was discovered, randy was in letty's apartment confronting her with suggestive evidence that she was tipping off uncle john. myrtle and letty testify that he was in the apartment when the fire was discovered. this puts him and letty in the dog house with celia(his apparent beau) and ted(who hopes to woo letty). this news also ends uncle john's trust in letty as an informant, and he suggests she leave town. instead, she switches sides and tells the wallaces why randy was in her apartment. uncle john tries once again to sabotage their ore run, and when that fails, there is a general shootout in town. you can guess the results.  the plot is well constructed and executed, with complicated relationships between the principles, and with a variety of obstacles for randy to overcome, with the sometimes aid of his associates. at least, randy was spared the necessity of bringing his uncle to justice. uncle john had a choice to avoid assassination, but arrogantly trusted that a woman wouldn't have the guts to carry out her threat. the presence of hayes and two beautiful wholesome single women, as well as little myrtle, much helped to lighten the otherwise tense atmosphere in this battle for survival, as uncle john put it.  it seems odd that barbara britton, the ""bad"" girl, gets top female billing over catherine craig, randy's love interest. barbara's on camera time was much more limited.   those who grew up on the lassie tv series featuring george cleveland as ""gramps"" will be surprised to find him playing such a mean controlling villain. we may wonder if his wheelchair-bound status has a bearing on this persona. this leaves him with few options for making a living in the wild west. without apparent family to help support him(except randy), he can't afford to have some upstart beat him out of the most profitable business in town. on the other hand, from his conversations, he probably achieved his status as the town ""boss"" before becoming wheelchair-bound.",1
this movie was a fascinating look at creole culture and society that few african americans are aware. my own two children are by products of a paternal grandmother whose father was a member of the gens de couleur libre and a black skin woman whose parents were ex-slaves. he married outside of and against his culture and was cut off from all of his family except for one sister who took pity on her brothers plight; raising 8 children during the great depression of 1929; providing the family with food whenever she could. of course she clandestinely aided this family fearing for her own ex-communication. my daughter was fascinated by the movie. we have made it a part of our library.,1
"i did not enjoy the film, joshua, at all. perhaps it is because i saw another, much better similar film titled orphan 2 days prior but perhaps it's really just because this film was not very good. i am going with the ladder. sure, the plot of an evil child is not exactly original but that doesn't mean the film could not succeed. it could have been suspenseful and entertaining and chilling but instead it was slow building, boring, uneventful and really didn't leave me thinking anything more than 'that wasn't very good' when it was all over.  at the end, joshua's motivations are revealed. i won't give that away but the reality is that he didn't really accomplish his goals since despite vera farmiga as his mother, abby, disappearing about 3/4th through the movie, all arrows point to her returning home soon. she was committed to a mental institution because she was losing her mind but then joshua's father/her husband was accused of tampering with her medication which tells the audience that the institution realized that she was indeed not mentally ill but rather was being dosed medically. so.. shouldn't she be coming home soon? won't joshua have failed? won't his mother be living with him and his sister and possibly his father soon? i question the father since his future is left open ended.  at the end of the day, i didn't care about the characters. the evil demon child joshua wasn't really scary. the storyline moved slowly and when it picked up it was still boring. suspense fell flat every single time. when it was over i couldn't believe i had sat through the whole thing.   4/10 just because the acting was good from the parents especially vera farmiga as the mother but if you want to see a movie about an evil 'child' go see orphan. now that's a movie that took an unoriginal concept and created a brilliant movie.",0
"midnight cowboy opens with a run down drive in theater with the voice-over of the main character joe buck (jon voight) singing in the shower. he is singing a cowboy song, the very thing he strives to be. joe picks up his humdrum life living in texas and moves it to new york city with the dream of lots of women, and even more money. he dresses as the epitome of the cowboy, but in a cartoonish fashion, not even his friends take him seriously. he begins his journey on the bus to nyc and we can quickly see how diluted joe is through his interactions with the other passengers. this is primarily a story of joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world.  he starts off as a very naïve southerner thinking he can make it in nyc just on his good looks. he has no other reason to think otherwise, as they proved helpful in the past; we learn this from the many flashbacks he has. in the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical. they are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance, as they are, they are coming out of his past. however, as joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of nyc we see more of his past, which is no longer whimsical but gritty, filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events. this is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted, and her being raped. in one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. this mirrors the way in which joe himself is falling apart; the naiveté that he once carried is falling off of him. he and ratso (dustin hoffman) are living in squalor, and barely able to get food to eat; joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks, that there is a gritty underbelly of new york that he didn't envision. his subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.  ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to joe, but in an opposite way; ratso is joe's foil. joe is a handsome, strong man who, for the most part, has a good outward appearance. ratso, on the other hand, from the very first time we see him sitting next to joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite. he is short, dark, and always coated with a sheen of sweat. he understands how the world works, that it is unforgiving, and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail; just as his father did. they are living in the same world, the same apartment even, but they understand things on a completely different level.  the theme of alienation, one that is common of this era, is very apparent in this film. neither joe nor ratso fit into the culture surrounding them. joe feels trapped in texas and moves to nyc where he is still very much an outsider. ratso, living in the cold of nyc, wishes to move to sunny florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life. even though this is his ideal, in the fantasy we get from ratso's perspective, it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society. in said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him, he is yet again an outsider, alienated from society.  it is not until the end that the gap between joe and ratso begins to narrow. joe resorts to violence; he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for florida for himself and ratso. on the journey we see joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film. he is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to florida for vacation. he dresses ratso the same way; he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering, but it is to no avail. upon ratso's death on the bus, their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders. even in this new culture they have entered, they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film. despite the ratso's death, and joe's continued alienation, the film ends with the hope that joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in nyc. midnight cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society, and alienation, with stellar performances by both voight and hoffman.",1
"steve carrel proves himself to be a great leading man in this wonderful, original, raunchy breath of fresh air. i about wet myself at how geniusly hilarious it was.  basically the movie's title says it all: andy stitzer is a 40 year- old male who works at an electronics store. he is a bit of a nerd who loves videogames and comics, and has the biggest collection. his peers that work in the store with him find out that he's a virgin during a rather sex dialogue filled poker game, and then andy has to go through a rather funny as hell odyessy of rude sexual awakenings, but always screwing up which leads to him not losing his virginity, but he eventually gets lucky in the very end.  leave the little ones at home, but take the entire family to see this awesome romantic adult comedy. it will have you hooked and cracking up from the very beginning, and by the time it is over, you will be wishing you wore your extra thick absorbent undergarments. only other thing i can say about it is too bad steve carrel wasn't recognized as a leaving man 20 years ago. he is definitely gonna win best breakthrough male performance in next years mtv movie awards. you can bet your hard earned dollar on that, people!  i give this one a perfect 10!",1
"i went to this movie only because i was dragged there and i would have left again immediately because the audience consisted mainly of elderly people and i felt out of place. however, the film was utterly fascinating and far from being targeted towards old people. the characters were all very real and believable and i found myself discussing the film, the characters and the storyline for hours afterwards. there are a few quite engrossing scenes in there but they are necessary and help you to understand the situation much better. all in all, this is a great and valuable film - slightly off mainstream but that does not mean that this film cannot be enjoyed by people who prefer mainstream. it's a thrilling and interesting movie experience.",1
"i read john everingham's story years ago in reader's digest, and i remember thinking what a great movie it would make. and it probably would have been had michael landon never got his hands on it. as far as i'm concerned, landon was one of the worst actors on earth, and his artistic license went way over the top, similar to his massacre of the ""little house"" book series is proof. the acting, for lack of a better word, is atrocious, the screenplay sloppy, and there are more close-ups of landon's puss than should be allowed.  this movie reflects everingham's story as much as ""little house on the prairie"" reflects the books is was ""based"" on. it's just another vehicle to show off landons horrendous hair.",0
"i remember watching this film on saturday afternoon tv in the 1950s or 60s. it was well presented but i do remember there was a message of hope broadcast from transmitters secreted in lamposts in one of the last maniacal executions for impending liberation. i'm not sure that squares with the facts.  still the film is well done. the german high command reports wryly without emotion ""the russians are advancing down the fredrich strasse"" as if all went according to plan.  it was my impression that this film and a later american made for tv knock-off was based on the british historian trevor-roper's account by a similar title last days of hitler. i was surprised to see no credit to trevor-roper.  i agree the newest german film on the subject downfall was as well done as the classic. the american knock-off was a little flat.  few figures have attracted as much attention from the cinema as adolph. yet i find it interesting that none of the many films and books that have come out ever speak of hitler's double alluded to in passing in john toland's magnificent historical piece.  was gibs?",1

"terrible film made on a budget of about $9.99. very obvious miniature sets used, poor acting and an awful storyline concerning aliens who use discarded meat from a butcher shop as fuel for their spaceship. the film contains some blood (not enough to disturb) and a character with an eggbeater replacing one of his hands. (yes you read that correctly.)  one saving grace was a song performed at the ""talent show"" (how's that for irony?) by a punk/new wave band that i think was called ""i'm a heat seeking missile"". other than that, this is not worth your time, not even on a ""so bad it's good"" level. watch if you are into cheesy alien films, but anyone else should steer clear.   rating: 1 out of 10",0
"for what it is, ""raising victor vargas"" is about as close to perfection as a film can get. either sheer genius from a fledgling auteur or just one of those lucky mixes where everything clicked (probably some of each), this simple little slice-of-urban-life ethnic first love flick fleshes out its young characters with such depth you can almost read their minds. the film begins with a strong flavor of ""street"" but works its way into a latino family affair and then focuses on a story which speaks volumes about the uncertainty of youth and the profoundly natural desire to love another. in my experience, never has so much been done with so little (cast of tyros, novice director, etc.). praised by the critics but not for everyone, ""raising victor vargas"" is recommended for indie lovers and realists into simple tales rich in humanness.

"somebody called howard koch a schlockmeister but he did write the screenplay for ""casablanca"", didn't he? or didn't he. maybe there's more than one koch slinking around in hollywood, and i'm not too fond of ""casablanca"" anyway. wait a minute -- yes, there is another howard koch slinking around hollwyood. that's the one who wrote ""casablanca."" no matter. i'll put as much care into this comment as ""howard w. koch"" put into this production, which is to say only a little.  you know what this sounds like? somebody read cliff's notes on shakespeare's ""king lear"" and decided, since no original thoughts were aboard the inbound inspiration express, to update it and hollywoodize it with a happy ending.  there are differences. lear decides to divvy up his vast estates between three sisters and before doing so, asks them how much they love him. two of the sisters throw themselves at his feet and brown nose him to get at his money. the third is the good girl and refuses to go operatic on lear. but in the play, lear remains alive to regret his decision to give the two connivers his stash and deprive the honest girl. he winds up crazy and naked during a gale on the moors, putting flowers in his hair and hallucinating. kids can do that to you. (take my kid, for instance. after all the effort i squandered on raising him, does he show any interest in becoming a doctor or a lawyer? no.) in the end, everybody in the play dies.  in the movie, evidently, the good sister is morose and suicidal but when she tries to off herself, somebody jumps in and saves her, so the ending is, more or less, happy. that's the difference between hollywood and a genuine tragedy, unless you define hollywood as a tragedy sufficient unto itself.",0
"this was filmed back-to-back with the 1992 re-make of conan doyle's famous novel 'the lost world'. and it shows.  the film starts promisingly enough, with a ruthless organization intending to exploit the lost world and challenger et al returning to defend the prehistoric plateau, but then things go downhill. everybody is stranded on the plateau and we're left with a feeble, boring, over-length rehash of the first film.  the dinosaurs (who are hardly ever seen) are just laughable. are we expected to take that cuddly toy that's supposed to be an ankylosaur seriously? and the tyrannosaur seems rooted to the spot.  do yourself a favor and get hold of the 1925 silent version of the lost world. unbelievably in this age of cgi and other advanced effects, the twenties version is the best and will remain so until somebody finally decides to do a decent re-make.",0
"*contains spoilers due to me having to describe some film techniques, so read at your own risk!*  i loved this film. the use of tinting in some of the scenes makes it seem like an old photograph come to life. i also enjoyed the projection of people on a back screen. for instance, in one scene, leopold calls his wife and she is projected behind him rather than in a typical split screen. her face is huge in the back and leo's is in the foreground.  one of the best uses of this is when the young boys kill the ravensteins on the train, a scene shot in an almost political poster style, with facial close ups. it reminded me of battleship potemkin, that intense constant style coupled with the spray of red to convey tons of horror without much gore. same with the scene when katharina finds her father dead in the bathtub...you can only see the red water on the side. it is one of the things i love about von trier, his understatement of horror, which ends up making it all the more creepy.  the use of text in the film was unique, like when leo's character is pushed by the word, ""werewolf."" i have never seen anything like that in a film.  the use of black comedy in this film was well done. ernst-hugo järegård is great as leo's uncle. it brings up the snickers i got from his role in the kingdom (riget.) this humor makes the plotline of absurd anal retentiveness of train conductors against the terrible backdrop of ww2 and all the chaos, easier to take. it reminds me of riget in the way the hospital administrator is trying to maintain a normalcy at the end of part one when everything is going crazy. it shows that some people are truly oblivious to the awful things happening around them. yet some people, like leo, are tuned in, but do nothing positive about it.  the voice over, done expertly well by max von sydow, is amusing too. it draws you into the story and makes you jump into leo's head, which at times is a scary place to be.  the movie brings up the point that one is a coward if they don't choose a side. i see the same idea used in dancer in the dark, where bjork's character doesn't speak up for herself and ends up being her own destruction. actually, at one time, von trier seemed anti-woman to me, by making breaking the waves and dancer, but now i know his male characters don't fare well either! i found myself at the same place during the end of dancer, when you seriously want the main character to rethink their actions, but of course, they never do!",1
"during the cheap filmed in video beginning of crazy fat ethel ii, i wondered if it was the same film that was on the cover. unfortunately, it was. the story itself is mindlessly simple. ethel, a homicidal maniac with an eating disorder, is released into a halfway house because of hospital overcrowding. she is by far the most sane resident watching while one man puts dead flies into another's soup. ethel is then teased by one of the halfway house employees with a chocolate bar after he hits on the cost cutting measure of feeding the residents dog food. ethel retaliates by strangling him with a wire noose on the stairs and then....well, you get the idea. if this all sounds like fun, it isn't. this film was poorly made with cheap effects and even worse acting. the characters are so wooden when delivering their lines that they should be standing out in front of a cigar store. to make matters worse, half of the film consists of flashbacks to the first ethel movie, criminally insane, which is little better. a very poor effort.",0
"it takes a very special kind of person to make a movie that is so wretched, beguiling, disgusting and repulsive, but make it in a way that also makes it brilliant and the quintessence of personal cinematic liberation. crispin glover, in all of his ""out there"" antics and predispositions, truly made something that is unique. in a world that has become starkly partisan, this film seems to evade the standard lines of creativity and art and effectively startle everyone.   right off the bat, the film takes on a rather distant paradigm (if there really is a model at all) and initially shapes it with the likes of shirley temple in front of a swastika and naked women pleasuring a man with cerebral palsy. it's rather shocking stuff, but if you had the opportunity for the q&a sessions after the screenings, it clearly opens up a bag of worms that leaves you wondering whether this is art or just the lowest common denominator. in either guise, you sense the tremor that this film will ultimately cause. it will never be accepted, not even by the supposed auteurs of the world who boringly speak about the human condition. you may not like it, but it is certainly something worth watching.",1

"i knew about but had never seen grey gardens, before i saw the broadway musical of the same name. friends cautioned me that if i had not seen the movie, the musical would not make sense. it did, but it also prompted me to rent the movie. at first, i thought it was a train wreck, full of strange, shrieking characters, and it was exceedingly hard to watch. but being able to stop it, digest it and go back to it made me realize why grey gardens is considered to be a memorable documentary.   both big edie and little edie are unforgettable and their utter lack of self-consciousness is worth witnessing. both of them remain beautiful despite their encroaching age. they have a relationship that will chill any woman (and undoubtedly some men) and make you re- examine your own dealings with your mother. in an era when reality television and cinema is commonplace, it's fascinating to see the mayleses' work from three decades ago, and realize what an impact the film must have had.  i echo what other posters have said: how were they allowed to slip into such squalor by their family? but beyond that, how could two people living in the 1970s be able to escape reality in such a complete fashion? or were they simply considered too crazy to be helped? i would highly recommend watching this with the commentary track, which gave me additional insight into the film.",1
"i am at a distinct disadvantage here. i have not seen the first two movies in this series, although i have seen a lot of larry cohen films. fans of the series seem to think this is a good film. judging it on it's own, it was pretty boring.  you never get a real good look at the maniac cop's (robert z'dar) face, but what i did see was pretty grim. the death scenes seem to be staged to eat up the most film, not to give any thrills. maybe if i saw the nc-17 director's cut, i may be more impressed.  the ending with the car chase with z'dar, caitlin dulany, and robert davi was pretty intense. best part of the movie.",0
"it seems hal hartley's films are kind of hit or miss with most audiences. this film will be no exception to that rule. fay grim acts as a sequel to hartley's 'henry foole' from 1998. the focus this time is on henry's ex wife (played to perfection by the always welcome parker posey), who is being pestered by cia goons about henry's unpublished book about all of his shady dealings. in the interim of all of this, fay ends up on an odyssey,dealing with international spies,etc. the film does get a bit bogged down in the second half. if you've been a fan of hal hartley in the past, this is one not to be missed. for the novice hartley first timer who has only heard of his film making technique, you might want to check out his earlier films before taking on this one (especially if you haven't seen 'henry' yet). i admired the camera work,which at times reminded me of certain early man ray photography.",1
"excellent, pre-code amoral tale with barbara stanwyck as the newly inspired (by writings of nietzsche!) to drive out her sensitivities and exploit herself, use men to her advantage. not really fair on the german philosopher but interesting that this was the year hitler came to power. stanwyck, even in this young version doesn't do a lot for me but she certainly performs well here, ever driving herself and the film forward. not as much flesh on display here as one might have expected but plenty of risqué situations and astonishing quips and innuendo. great fun, if not a particularly attractive presentation of men and i suppose in all honesty not a very attractive view of the gold digging female. still, that's life!",1
"this is almost typical lynch. however, what makes this film slightly unusual for lynch is the fact that it looks very raw, almost amateurish. but i believe lynch does this on purpose to give a greater sense of realism, which serves to increase the intensity of surreal moments.  however, a lot of typical lynch motifs are present, such as: floating camera work; haunting music; long (excruciating) pauses; hanging curtains; dim lights growing darker at a slow (almost indiscernible) pace; extreme close ups; themes of women in trouble; over-bearing, incompassionate, all knowing characters facing off with characters who are distraught, temporarily oblivious, in the dark and so on...  the performances are great and the short is thought provoking. as usual, lynch leaves almost everything up to interpretation. many questions are left unanswered and this ignites the imagination.  another brilliant effort from lynch. i only hope he makes some shorts, more along the lines of his sony playstation 2 commercials. they were inspired.",1
"it's 1978, and yes obviously there are too many black players on the teams as well! fans will be upset and certainly the 75,000 seats will be full, only less happy there are so many black players on the field! this made for tv super bowl movie is watchable. it's not much more, but it's really surprising the cast of talented actors that make an appearance (for the time), probably most notably tom selleck. unfortunately any goodness selleck brings to the screen, is quickly trumped by ""actors"" like dick butkus.  it's a silly story about super bowl betting. pj jackson is charged by ""new york"" (read mafia) for ensuring the game ends for their favor, in this case a $10,000,000 bet. pj is innocent enough, and seems to have a loose grasp by buying off a few people here and there. but things seem to fall apart for him. another person, the unsuspected lainie, takes charge. for a while, the mystery of murders isn't known for certain, but is revealed rather plainly at the final murder that lainie is the new antagonist.  it's a bad movie, but is watchable. the acting is decent, and the filming is ok. at least there weren't any silly typical 70s car chases (they have their place just not here). just keep an open mind about past stereotyping and the cocaine era and you'll survive.  2/10 (maybe a 2.5)",0

""my super ex-girlfriend"" is delightfully silly and funny. this romantic comedy-adventure has many hilarious moments and is very entertaining. luke wilson is great in the role of an idiot, anna farris is extremely sexy as usual, and uma thurman is great in the role of a deranged neurotic superhero that recalls glenn close in ""fatal attraction"" or evelyn draper in ""play misty for me"". my vote is seven.  title (brazil): ""minha super ex-namorada"" (""my super ex-girlfriend"")",1

"i found this to be an utter waste of time, effort and money. i know disney always displays lack of creativity when making ""straight-to-video"" films - but rehashing the plot of the original film with a ""new perspective"" is an all-time low...soon they'll just be re-releasing the original films with new animation and new songs and be calling it a ""new version of the movie we all love."" nathan lane surprisingly returns to his role of timon yet again. timon and pumbaa the animated animals from the world of the original ""lion king"" embark on a narrative journey to tell us the original story the way it really happened...as they see it.  of course timon is now the hero of the story, yadda yadda yadda, blah blah blah...  the musical sequences are lame and the animation is crap. the vocal talents are impressive for a video feature, but then again, when was the last time you remember matthew broderick, whoopi goldberg or nathan lane being in anything of real commercial substance? overall if you liked the original you'll hate this. it's insulting because it's unfair to children and adults alike. and that about sums it up.",0
"pufnstuf is what it is. i saw this in the cinema at age 4 and i have very fond, and vivid, memories of it. seeing this as as adult allows one to catch the references that are way over the heads of the target audience - like the bit where jimmy's grey witch wig is ripped off and witch hazel (cass) sneers ""i knew she had brown roots!"". it is of course heavily influenced by the flower power culture of the time, and in some ways quite progressive. the track different, for example sends a clear message to the young viewers about being yourself, not running with the pack, and cherishing what is is about yourself that is different. this could be an anthem to the gay community, it should be, great track.  martha raye, cass elliot and billie hayes are all great as witches, and the living island cast give it their all in the confines of their character suits (includes billy barty, felix silla and other famous names). there is a lot of over acting in this film - there's really nothing subtle, and when little jack wild has to emote his concern for the kidnapped residents of living island it's really little more than yelling. this is drama and comedy spread on with a trowel. while i think of it - i never could stand the flute though.  i love the soundtrack, especially the above mentioned different but also zap the world, pufnstuf and even jack wild's touching if i could. what's more, it is now out on cd from the tasteful people at el records in london. see here for more: www.cherryred.co.uk/el/artists/pufnstuf.htm",1
"so what constitutes a real independent film? in a day and age where the latest fad of mainstream hollywood is to appear rugged and cutting edge, i'm sorry to say that what the general public tends to perceive as independent film is usually nothing more than a clever marketing ploy.  which is why we should be glad that films like ""hatred of a minute"" exist. across the board, this film makes a point out of contradicting its own template (indie horror film). love it or hate it, ""hatred"" isn't afraid of being what it is, and in watching this film, you get the real sense that kallio (the director) didn't just make this film to spray fake blood all over the place, he's in this to tell stories. good ones. you may find this film in the horror film section of your video store, but don't be fooled, this story is also about love, about good people pushed over the edge, and that oh-so-distant light at the end of the tunnel.  if you expect smut, or an evil dead ripoff, stay away from this film. but if you dig the finer points of the horror/suspense genres, check this film out.  yes. bruce campbell did produce this movie, and i'm sure he's proud to tell anyone that it's not ""evil dead"". bruce has never tried to bank on his ""ash"" image, and it's obvious that he didn't get involved with ""hatred"" so that it could do so either.  my advice, though, to all dead-ites rabidly devouring anything issued by mr. campbell is to check this film out anyway and see what else mr. kallio and mr. campbell are trying to show you.  the acting is well done, although nothing about this film is oscar caliber (perhaps intentionally), it's good to see compassionate performances in a horror film. so often, actors in films such as these don't even seem to try, with ""hatred"", it seemed as though all the actors took thier charecters very seriously, never resorting to typical horror-film campiness.  technically, ""hatred"" is about as competent as indie film gets. the editing is fast paced, the cinematography is good given the budget, and ""hatred"" keeps a quick pace, without any bog-down points or bad anti-climaxes.  all in all, hatred may not have the glossed over look of all those multi-million dollar fake indies, but personally, i don't see a problem with that. it's a film by folks who actually care about the medium. people who reached into thier broke ass pockets, pulled out thier nickles and dimes, threw caution to the wind and made a damn good movie.  check this one out.",1
"this is another one of those movies that could have been great. the basic premise is good - immortal cat people who kill to live, etc. - sort of a variation on the vampire concept.  the thing that makes it all fall apart is the total recklessness of the main characters. even sociopaths know that you need to keep a low profile if you want to survive - look how long it took to catch the unibomber, and that was because a family member figured it out.  by contrast, the kid (and to a lesser extent, the mom) behave as though they're untouchable. the kid kills without a thought for not leaving evidence or a trail or a living witness. how these people managed to stay alive and undiscovered for a month is unbelievable, let alone decades or centuries.  it's really a shame - this could have been so much more if it had been written plausibly, i.e., giving the main characters the level of common sense they would have needed to get by for so long.  other than that, not a bad showing. i loved the bit at the end where every cat in town converges on the house - every time i put out food on the porch and see our cats suddenly rush in from wherever they were before, i think of that scene.",0
"at the beginning we get to see the start of a secret council of some sorts. it all looks very promising from the get go. with some supernatural elements thrown in, the mystery gets more interesting by the minute. the main character who seems like a good bloke gets into trouble because of his claim for money he is entitled to (temptation) and other factors. you really empathize with the guy and you want to know what exactly is going on. normally a person in his situation would have several options. somehow he does not have those options. in this movie there only seems to be one solution even when it is clear it is not his fault. out of the blue he encounters characters who talk about church,prayer and god. and they provide the answer for his problem. it should be obvious at a point in the movie what this solution is. now let me say that there is nothing wrong with this message. since it always is helpful. but was it really necessary to disguise this message. this religious element actually ruined the viewing experience for me. while the message is good,it's simplicity can't escape the fact that in real life more needs to happen to resolve issues presented in this movie. the mystery that is presented to us never gets solved. in stead you are forced to deal with another topic that essentially has nothing to do with the plot. don't get fooled because of malcolm mcdowell. the once brilliant actor is adequate,but if you watch closely you will see that he is not serious at all. he really must be desperate for money. otherwise what would posses an actor of his caliber to act in a movie like this.",0

"this 1981 comedy still sparkles thanks to the combined efforts of writer/director steve gordon and stars dudley moore and john gielgud. sadly, gordon, only in his early forties, died soon after completing this, his only feature film. it's an especially unfortunate loss since he shows a truly deft hand at character-driven farce that makes the whole film irresistible. it plays almost like a 1930's-style screwball comedy revamped for contemporary tastes. the plot centers on arthur bach, a drunken, diminutive millionaire playboy who is at risk of losing his $750 million inheritance if he doesn't marry the dowdy and boring susan johnson, an heiress handpicked by his old-money father and dotty grandmother. of course, he doesn't love her and by chance, runs into linda marolla, a working-class waitress (and of course, aspiring actress) after she pilfers a bergdorf goodman tie for her father.  the standard complications ensue but in a most endearing way with loads of alcohol-fueled slapstick executed with classic élan by moore. that he makes such a spoiled character likable is a credit not only to his comic talents but to gielgud's feisty, acidic turn as hobson, arthur's devoted but reality-grounded valet. it's the type of role he could play in his sleep, but gielgud makes hobson such a truly memorable character that his fate in the film brings a welcome injection of poignancy in the proceedings. in probably her most likable film role, liza minnelli hands the picture to her male co-stars by toning down her usual razzle-dazzle personality and making linda quite genuine in motivation.  a pre-""la law"" jill eikenberry plays susan just at the right passive-aggressive note, while barney martin (jerry's dad on ""seinfeld"") steals all his scenes as linda's slovenly father ralph. the one fly in the ointment is veteran actress geraldine fitzgerald, who overdoes the eccentricities of the grandmother. and i have to admit that i still can't stand the very dated, overplayed christopher cross song that inevitably won the oscar for that year's best song. unfortunately, the 1997 dvd, certainly in need of remastering, has no extras worth noting except some photos and production notes.",1
"'i don't understand. none of this makes any sense!', exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of death smiles at murder. having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie, i know exactly how he feels. the story, by the film's director aristide massacessi (good old joe d'amato using his real name for a change), is a clumsy mix of the supernatural, murder/mystery, and pretentious arty rubbish, the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as jess franco's more bizarre efforts, but which had me struggling to remain conscious.  opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister (with whom he had been having an incestuous affair, before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor), death smiles at murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman (played by ewa aulin, who stars in the equally strange 'death laid an egg') is seen alive and kicking, the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of walter and eva von ravensbrück. after being invited to stay and recuperate in their home, where she is tended to by creepy dr. sturges (klaus kinski in a throwaway role), the comely lass begins love affairs with both mr. and mrs. ravensbrück (meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovin').  'so far, so good', i thought to myself at this point, 'we've had hunchbacks, incest, some blood and guts, and gratuitous female nudity'all ingredients of a great trashy euro-horror; what follows, however, is a lame attempt by massacessi to combine giallo style killings, ghostly goings on, and even elements from edgar allan poe's 'the black cat', to tell a very silly, utterly bewildering, and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the grave.  this film seems to have quite few admirers here on imdb, but given the choice, i would much rather watch one of the director's sleazier movies from later in his career; i guess incomprehensible, meandering, surreal 70s gothic horror just ain't my thing! 2.5 out of 10 (purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness), rounded up to 3 for imdb.",0

"please do not let the cover of this movie fool you. and if you're looking for a cheap horror movie to laugh at: this isn't it. usually i will go for stupid if it's funny, but this stupid was so stupid it almost (or possibly did) make me stupid.  the film quality is better than a handheld, but not by much, and it's quite possible the music was created by pressing the samba 2 key on a casio keyboard. these problems should never really be a deterent from seeing a horror movie but add this amazing (weep) cast, and you have a real humdinger.  the story is about a guy who invites his friends up to his family cabin in texas for the weekend. he also extends the invitation to his lady crush in his office. on the way there they meet a female in distress, who is then invited to come along by the other girls.  the stay at the cabin includes sex and nudity and soon everyone's panties are in a bunch when one girl disappears and odd items turn up in the house.  from there you (the audience) and the morons, um, actors, try to figure out what's going on and they soon begin to distrust one another. overall i think i have made it sound better than it is. the main struggle with this movie is that the characters are very underdeveloped, the plot contrived, the acting bad and the motivations clueless. once more this could be forgiveable it it was the least bit funny but alas, it is not.  the twist ending is only a twist in that no one would guess it simply because if you really thought back through the movie it would not have made sense anyway. please don't let this review stop you from seeing the shear wonderment of this movie.

"my wife and i have watched this whole series at least three times. i can't imagine how it could be better. this isn't the ""complete"" history of wwiino library could hold such a historybut it is the best summary of that history. lots of detail, lots of personal stories, and still keeps the overall picture in view.  olivier's narration is excellently written and, of course, superbly given. the interviews are from all sides, except the russian, because the producers were not allowed to talk to many russians. it is very much worth owning this complete program on dvd. we treasure our copy.  the producer's do an excellent job of providing pictures and action where there was almost none extant in any archive: there are almost no films of convoys and submarine battles, for instance, but still, the episode on this subject is very well done.",1
"too bad, i really like kristen cloke and gary busey. but the director failed to put this together. there's a lot of action, a lot of promise, but it all comes off hokey. the director didn't do his job. promising action comes off lame. so much seems contrived in a desperate attempt to save the film. this version of ""the rage"" (directv credits it as 1996) simply isn't worth the time to watch it. another director would have done a better job.",0
"it was probably just my dvd---but i would not recommend that anyone try to watch this picture on a dvd.  i had to turn up the volume on my tv to the highest possible level, in order to hear about 80 percent of the dialog. some of the talking still remained sub-audible. if you're from scotland, you might have a chance, albeit a slim one.  peoples voices were drowned out by nearly all ambient sounds, including unwrapping a package, footsteps, even puffing on a cigarette.   with the volume turned up to a level at which voices can be heard, i can guarantee that at least one of your neighbors will phone the police when the scene changes to a loud environment, such as a disco. and that you will injure yourself diving for the remote to turn it back down.  there is art and there is art, even in the field of audio mixing. but this effort, in a time of war, would meet international criteria to be classified as an atrocity.  after about a half hour, i gave up, having seen nothing else redeeming in the picture, either.",0
"i basically found eden's curve to be a very poorly constructed that made it difficult to watch. however, there is something i must say about how the director captured something about the atmosphere of the early 70's in the choice of settings and clothing. the ""back to the earth"" philosophy and the interest in sexual exploration and drugs that was not dramatically decadent, as portrayed in many later versions of the 70's was right on, as was the ""don't ask don't tell"" pseudo-liberalism of the fraternity made up of east-coast intellectuals, except that i would have thought this was more likely of a new england school rather than one in virginia, where i imagine the ""good ole boy"" mentality still dominated even elitist schools like this one. another thing i appreciated and could relate to is that this was a time when homosexuality was not linked so much to leathermen or drag queens and i appreciated some homosexual roles not related to these terribly overused images. i felt it was very unfortunate that ""gay culture"" took on certain standard forms in the 80's out of castro and christopher streets and these defined the movement and left out huge numbers of gay men that were more subdued in their lifestyles. i appreciated the film mainly as a way of remembering a more natural way we were about our sexuality and personal relationships without ""the scene.""",0
"in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass, this film was probably quite revealing in its day. however, i get the feeling that neorealism was never really director de sica's bag, since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country. after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage, toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan. he organises the inhabitants into community action, and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables. that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me, as these people have far more important things to think about, like where the next pot noodle is going to come from. anyway, de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are. it's all down to capitalism of course, and in order to illustrate this, he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land. brilliant! to his credit, though, by this time he has given up on making a serious film, and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures, all fur coats and cigars. they want that land, but our mathematical hero will not support such nonsense. by a bizarre stroke of luck, his old, deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove. he uses it to shower gifts on his mates, who prove just as greedy as the cigar men. i reckon this film was a missed opportunity. to address the theme of poverty , as not many film-makers had done until then, and then get caught up in a fairy tale, to me seems a bit daft. how come 'great' directors get away with child-like plot turns like the ones we see here? hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks. de sica, however, is proclaimed as a genius for this. surely the fact that these people are so poor, that their faith is unswerving, and that miracles never happen to them, is enough for any story-teller to work on.

"i thought the original of this film was quaint and charming as well as having me sitting on the edge of my seat trying to figure it out.  since i had already seen the original, when i saw this on sci fi channel- i don't know if this remake was deliberately made for sci fi - i knew what it was within the first few minutes. since i like richard burgi as a character actor, i wanted to see how he would pull it off.  the writers/producers etc, modernized the film a bit by trying to explain the plight of the ""aliens"" (they could no longer reproduce their own kind and needed help) using the same pseudo science that has been crammed in our ears in the 90's. maybe it added a bit of polish to the film, or not.  this film. film? this production takes on a more sinister edge than the original did- the original ended with a confrontation between the young woman and the alien and an understanding of sorts took place, although no resolution of the alien's problem.  i sort of remember that in this remake, the woman became rather hostile towards the burgi/alien- i think it could have ended better. but the ending is just the ending, and the yarn is a swell yarn, being of the basic 1958 science fiction pulp stock. many great science fiction stories were written in the 50's and some of them even made it to film.  this is a swell thing to watch on like a rainy day or something. i rate it highly cos of all the remakes of old 50's sci fi, this one came off well. i actually enjoyed this quite a bit.  but if anyone really wants to see this story told well, i suggest the original 1958 version with tom tyron and gloria talbott, directed by gene fowler jr.",1
"i enjoy watching western films but this movie takes the biscuit. the script and dialogue is laughable. the acting was awful, where did they get them from? music was ok i have to say. luckily i didn't buy or rent the movie but its now disposed of.  i was geared up at the beginning when the stranger (martin sheen) started to tell his story. i have to admit i did enjoy the confrontation between hopalong and tex where hopalong shot tex's finger off and told him to practise for 40 years to reach his league. but thats where it all went pear shaped thereafter. i had to watch the whole film in the hope that it would get better, never did.",0
"i knew that 'evening' was a girlie film, so i was expecting to be bored. a wicked tease on imdb had said that it was a 'chick flick' but that your companion would survive.  survive? yes. i am still here, but when the two of us came out we were amazed to find that it had only lasted two hours - it seemed a much longer evening than that! i suppose that, for yanks, it is supposed to be elevating or fascinating because it is about rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a wide verandah and a lawn but no apparent lawnmower. if that sort of thing impresses you it might seem quite a short film.  there's a monty python film about a knight who just won't die. he ends up a wriggling (why do yanks add an third syllable to this word i wonder) torso in the road still shouting threats at his nemesis. this film is also about a sort of living dead. vanessa redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave dodger shown here) goes on and on dying whilst having inappropriate guilt. she's not worried about having been a wide-eyed, breathless bimbo, but imagines herself a murderess.  obviously, being a girlie film, there's a chap who is supposed to be the mr darcy/heathcliff character. i'm not a woofter, so i can't claim to be a good judge of such things, but the tedious wimp who is wheeled out for this role seems only to have the title of servant in his favour. he's a bloodless cypher.  as you might gather, the main characters aren't much cop, but the minor ones manage, amazingly to be much worse. there's a fellow whose only job is to react to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. fair enough, but it isn't the role of hamlet - why ham it up so badly? forgetting that it was a girlie film, i thought he was going to be thrown out because any decent girl-friend would have told him that face-fungus didn't flatter him, but then i realised that she must have encouraged him to grow a 'beard' because he looked worse without it.  i kept awake by noticing which actors and actresses had their earlobes attached or free and noting interesting bits of scenery - if you're dragged along to it, see if you can spot the stuffed buffalo head, just the sort of thing you'd expect in a beach cottage.  apart from the obligatory wedding, there is only one piece of action. you'd have thought that they'd have got it right. sadly, though, the hit and run accident is carried out by a car that couldn't be there. when the accident is discovered the cast wander about shouting for a character that they can't know is nearby (but we do as the audience). if they don't have any clue that the person is within a couple of miles of the place, then why do they wander about aimlessly shouting for him? i suppose that the director's excuse is that it is supposed to be a half-remembered dream sequence...  another scenery item that caught my attention was a copper bottomed saucepan. i didn't think that the technology to do this was developed until the fifties.",0
"this film is lame, lame, lame!!!!! it takes a lot to bring me to over-exaggeration about a movie, but this movie stunk up my house!! i haven't even finished the movie yet and i had to stop to comment on how bad this movie is. i've never done that!! as a consumer, do not spend your money on this film. wait until it comes out on a cable channel or something. it's barely tv worthy. i really hate trashing a movie, but this movie is trash! barely above porn. should have and x rating! good plot, some frontal nudity (if that floats your boat), but horrible high school level acting. don't know how this movie received distribution. (must have been a contractual thing.) really, if you really like watching good movies, don't waste you time with this one. from one movie lover to another. you will be mad at yourself! let me say this as well, if you've been through something like this perhaps you can relate and it will have some value for you. in that case i say watch it, you may take something away from it, if not just seeing something that's happened to you being acted out by someone else (has therapeutic value).",0
"canto 1: how kriemhild mourned over siegfried and how king attila woos her through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlarn: kriemhild (margarete schön) insists on having the head of the killer of her beloved husband, hagen tronje (hans adalbert schlettow), but her brother, king gunther (theodor loos), refuses her request. when king attila of the huns woos kriemhild through his ambassador rüdiger von bechlar, she makes him promise through oath in the name of his king that no man would ever offend her. hagen tronje hides the nibelungen treasure in the bottom of a lake.  canto 2: how kriemhild takes leave from her homeland and how she was received by king attila: kriemhild brings some earth from where siegfried died, and travels to the court of the huns, where she is welcomed by attila himself, who also promises through oath to defend her.  canto 3: how king attila besieged rome and how kriemhild summoned her brothers: when kriemhild delivers a baby boy, attila returns to his realm and asks kriemhild what she would like most to please her. she asks him to invite her brothers to come to his kingdom.  canto 4: how kriemhild receives her brothers: kriemhild insists on having the head of hagen tronje, but her brothers keep loyalty to their friend and again do not accept her request.  canto 5: how the huns celebrated the summer solstice with the nibelungen: kriemhild asks attila to kill hagen tronje, but he refuses since in accordance with the laws of the desert, a guest is considered sacred. kriemhild offers gold to the hums for the head of hagen tronje. there is a fight, and hagen tronje kills attila's son.  canto 6: the nibelungen's distress: the huns lose the battle against the nibelungen, but keep them under siege inside attila's castle. kriemhild promises to spare their lives provided they deliver hagen tronje, but her brother gunther tells that german people are loyal with their friends.  canto 7: the nibelungen's end: after the death of rüdiger von bechlarn, giselher and gernot, hagen tronje and guhther are finally captured. kriemhild kills hagen tronje, ending her revenge with the destruction of the nibelungen.  the conclusion of the poetic saga of siegfried through ""kriemhild's revenge"" is also told through seven dramatic cantos. the nature of the first part is a magnificent tale of fantasy, adventure, romance and betrayal; the second part is a dramatic story of hate, revenge and loyalty. the solid screenplay with a perfect development of the characters, the excellent performances of the cast and the awesome direction of fritz lang produced another epic ahead of time. margarete schön is impressive with a total different woman, obsessed and inflexible in her revenge wish. the costumes that kriemhild wears are also very impressive, and her acting is based on her face and look. i was a little disappointed with the reaction of attila after the death of his only son, since i found it too passive. my vote is eight.  title (brazil): ""os nibelungos  parte ii: a vingança de kriemshild"" (""the nibelungen part ii: kriemhild's revenge"")",1

"it's hard for me to assign the ""fair"" number of stars to this film, but i settled on 8 because of its high production values and what was, in 1968, an innovative approach to the war film. remember too that i haven't seen it since 1969. but it did make a strong impression.  the long day's dying must be one of the most vivid antiwar films ever made. it achieves this simply by portraying in extremely realistic terms the actions of a handful of soldiers in northwestern europe in 1944-45. no film before this one showed war at the infantry squad level with so much brutal detail, and all in a coldly dispassionate way that lets the actions speak for themselves. there is no preaching, no sentimentality, no comic relief, no complicated scenarios.  unfortunately, there's no subtlety either. partly because of their situation - trying to stay alive - the characters come across as flat, familiar cliché's. as ""entertainment,"" the film doesn't make it, though it was clearly not intended to ""entertain."" it was intended to slug you over the head with the misery and horror of world war ii and modern war in general. this was twenty years before platoon and thirty before saving private ryan, both of which are far more ""watchable"" films. here the flat and generally disagreeable characters, the lack of an actual plot, and the realistically unpleasant images (including what may be the first on-screen vomit in theatrical history) make the film hard to sit through, though it is only 95 minutes.  so, 10 stars for production and realism, 4 stars for the feeling you'll have when it's over, a bonus star for having its heart in the right place. average: 8.  like carl foreman's underrated ""the victors,"" an equally downbeat but more interesting and thought-provoking film, the long day's dying seems not to be on dvd. why not? both films have been on cable a number of times.",1
"henri verneuil represented the commercial cinema in france from 1960-1980. always strong at the box-office, and usually telling dramatic and suspenseful tales of casino robberies, mafia score-settling and world war ii battles, verneuil could be counted on to give us two solid hours of entertainment on saturday night. he worked with the cream of the male actors of his day: gabin, belmondo, fernandel, delon, sharif, anthony quinn. i... comme icare is the only time he directed yves montand. it's an oddly static film, taking place mainly in offices and conference rooms, containing not one chase scene and hardly any violence.  montand gives a good performance, if somewhat dry, and he is well supported by the other actors. i couldn't help wondering what costa-gavras could have done with this story, on the basis of z (the lambrakis assassination) and l'aveu (the torture of artur london in czechoslovakia by stalinists).",1
"worst movie of all time? wow, whoa now. you cannot be serious.  maybe it's all about what you expect a movie to do to you. i live in oregon, so i got to enjoy the beautifully-filmed shots of familiar yet still amazingly beautiful smith rocks and other areas in central oregon (as well as the sweet cameo of our own ken kesey and ken babbs looking down on baby sissy's cradle at the beginning of the movie). those alone were enough to spur me to give the movie a better than ""average"" score.  or .... maybe it's all about what expectations you have. having read the book ages ago, and thinking to myself ""goodness, no one could ever make a movie out of this interesting, quirky, weird book ... especially 20 years later, when mores (morays -- can't put in the accent mark online) have changed"" -- i was actually quite pleasantly surprised when i first watched the movie when it came out in 1994 and even liked it more today watching it again.  sissy was exquisitely cast, and i don't care what you all say, i was also pleasantly surprised at rain phoenix's and john hurt's performances. i am not a lesbian nor bi nor trans, but have met many folks who are similar to the folks they were supposed to portray -- and those ""real"" folks kinda acted the same way as these actors acted. stilted a bit, stage-ey -- always a bit ""on."" gus van sant is one weird native oregonian but by garsh he done a good job adapting this crazy book, imho.",1

"in addition to his ""tarzan"" series, the prolific edgar rice burroughs did write many other books, although, aside from the popular ""at the earth's core"", few of these have been filmed. one exception is the novel entitled ""the lad and the lion"", brought to the screen as ""the lion man"" (1936), an over-talkative, static, old-hat, slow-moving and rather dull movie, despite being filmed on real desert locations. actually ""movie"" is the wrong word. the narrative doesn't move but proceeds at a snail's pace in an abrupt series of jerks. for instance, at least five characters are given elaborate opening scenes and then just disappear. even more frustrating for the keen movie fan, are the characters who make an impression of sorts (like the lass who plies hall with drugged wine) but are enacted by players who are not credited! the credited thespians generally come off worse than the unknowns. one exception is australian actress finis barton who gives a good account of the kidnapped harem girl who rescues young master fairy. admittedly, most of the cast are saddled with atrocious king james dialogue which has to be heard to be believed! but the way to play this rubbish is tongue-in-cheek, a stratagem which does not seem to have occurred to a single one of the film's roster of no-talent players. maybe director j.p. mccarthy scotched that idea. anyway, it's sad to see the lovely kathleen burke forced to trade lines with the likes of richard carlyle (her dad) and jon hall (her suitor). admittedly, mr hall delivers his lines with marginally more conviction than mr carlyle, but that is no recommendation.",0
"i watched part one two days ago and today i saw part two. of course the two parts are worlds apart so i am a little shaken by all that i just saw. i felt consumed by the knowledge of the inevitability of che's death; for me, it clouded the entire movie. i suppose that is exactly what soderbergh wanted us to feel, the slowly evolving inevitability of his death. part two was so downbeat compared to, again an inevitability but in cuba it was positive and in bolivia it was so negative. the politics of the movement in bolivia were only alluded to but rarely confronted didactically. for me the memorable scenes were all at the end of the film: the confrontation with the jailer and the milder talk with the bolivian official where that official questions che about the failure of the peasants to support his revolution. i had not considered the national differences playing as much role as they did in the conflict, argentine versus bolivian. i thought soderbergh dealt admirably with the inevitable problems of supply in a revolutionary struggle; how do you get food without antagonizing the peasants who do not have enough themselves. i was struck by how hard it would be to try something as che tried. i guess it is all in the timing; is there sufficient anger against the government to begin the movement; in bolivia there wasn't. che realized the terrible corundum of revolutionists in his letter to fidel read at the beginning of the film: if not now, when, 50 years from now. a very thought provoking and well done film; make every effort to see it.",1

"this is an ""anthology"" horror film. it's made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of robert bloch (who wrote for weird tales and was personal friends with h.p. lovecraft, but is most famous for the original story ""psycho""). the quality of the stories is very uneven and i didn't think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all. it would have been better to do it as a comedy like ""comedy of terrors."" only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way, and it's probably the best of them (the one with ingrid pitt). i've seen a few of these amicus anthology films and the only one that was really worth my time was freddie francis' ""tales from the crypt."" the anthology style works well for the producers, because it means that they can hire a bunch of ""big name"" actors, employ them for only one week of shooting or so, and then bring in the next big name. so you essentially pay for 6 weeks of movie star salary but get 5 or 6 different names on the marquee. but that's very unfortunate for the audience, because the audience would like to see some scenes with peter cushing, christopher lee, and ingrid pitt actually acting together. instead they're stuck in these vignettes by themselves. so let's take them one at a time, briefly.  the first story has denholm elliot, who does a really admirable job of trying to bring some dignity to his silly role as a writer terrorized by his own character. unfortunately the actor who plays dominic, the source of the horror, tom adams, just looks silly which ruins any possible horror. there's some hilarious stuff if you want to laugh at it though, like the scene where dominic kills elliot's psychiatrist. it's the patented scene where the killer creeps up behind the victim but nobody is watching, so the whole audience is supposed to shout out ""look out behind you!"" the second story is the one with peter cushing. god i love that man so much. too bad so many of his films, like this one, pretty much stink. in the story he's supposed to be pining away for a long-lost love, and he sees her likeness in a wax museum. it's a completely predictable story that goes nowhere.  then you have the bit with christopher lee, where he plays the father of a little kid who turns out to be a witch. again this bit could have been fun if it had been played for laughs. but instead we're supposed to be horrified when lee slaps the child and surprised when she turns out to be evil. the actress, chloe franks, was pretty good in that type of ""bad seed"" role though.  the last story is kind of amusing... ingrid pitt plays an actress and jon pertwee plays an actor who accidentally buys a vampire cape that turns him into a real vampire. that's about all the story has to offer. i was surprised at how bad ingrid pitt's english is, i guess she must have been dubbed in some of the other films i've seen her in.  not a very memorable film or one that i would recommend to anyone but horror completists.",0
"solid comedy entertainment, with musical interludes, it generates a fast pace that carries proceedings along in zestful tempo through a maze of humorous and chiller complications. boris karloff, bela lugosi and peter lorre form a strong setup of sinister villainy. the script contains all the standard mystery film props-sliding panels, secret passageways, thunder and lightning and poisoned blow-darts. karloff, lugosi and lorre go in for heavy leers and obvious melodramatics of the gaslit era. kay kyser and his band offered great entertainment for the people living in the 1940's who were trying to forget about the horror's of world war ii.",0
"there's a legion of mick garris haters out there who feel he couldn't direct a horror film of quality if he had to. and, sleepwalkers(..screenplay written by stephen king)is often used as an example of this. i like sleepwalkers, though i fully am aware that garris just says f#ck it and lets all hell break loose about fifteen or so minutes into the movie. forget character or plot development, who needs them anyway. it's about violent mayhem and bloody carnage as a mother and son pair of ""sleepwalkers""(..feline-human shapeshifting creatures who suck the lifeforce from virginal female innocents, moving from town to town, living a nomadic existence, truly powerful)set their sights on a teenager who doesn't surrender without a fight. before all is said and done, many will be slaughtered as a mother shan't tolerate the possible death of her beloved son.  garris wastes little time setting up those to be executed, as a teacher(glenn shadix), suspecting handsome, all american charmer charles brady(brian krause)to be someone entirely different from who he claims, gets his hand ripped off and his neck torn into. charles lures pretty virgins into his arms, drawing their energy, in turn ""feeding"" his hungry mama, mary(alice krige). the fresh new target is tanya robertson(mädchen amick), and she seems to be easy pickens, but this will not be the case and when charles is seriously injured in a struggle(..thanks to a deputy's cat, clovis), mary's vengeance will be reaped on all those who get her way. mary, come hell or high water, will retrieve tanya in the goal of ""refreshing"" her dying son.  like many teenagers, i had a crush on certain actresses i watched in movies. such as amy dolenz, i was smitten with mädchen amick. she's simply adorable in this movie and i love how she bites her lower lip displaying an obvious attraction towards charles, unaware of his ulterior motives. i just knew that mädchen amick would be destined to be a scream queen, but this would never be the case. too bad because i would've welcomed her in the genre with open arms.  krige is yummy as the menacing, damn sexy, but vicious and mean bitch who wipes out an entire police force and poor tanya's parents in one fail swoop, in less than ten or so minutes. she stabs one in the back with a corn cob! she bites the fingers off of poor ron perlman, before cracking his arm(..a bone protruding), knocking him unconscious with his own elbow! she tosses tanya's mom through a window after breaking a rose vase over her father's face! a deputy is stabbed in his ear by charles(cop-kebab!), falling on the pencil for extra impact. poor tanya is dragged by her hair from her home by mary, driven to the brady home, and forced into an impromptu dance with the crippled monster! the sheriff is hurled onto a picket fence and we see how cats combat the sleepwalkers unlike humans. we see mary and charles' abilities to ""dim"" themselves and his car using a power of invisibility. writer stephen king even finds time to include himself and horror director buddies of his in a crime scene sequence with clive barker and tobe hooper as forensics officers, joe dante and john landis as photograph experts.  the film is shot in a tongue-in-cheek, let-it-all-hang-out manner with music appropriately hammering this technique home. it's about the ultra-violence, simple as that, with some deranged behavior and jet black humor complimenting garris' direction and king's screenplay. the incestuous angle of the sleepwalkers is a bit jarring and in-your-face. without a lick of complexity, this is closer in vein to king's own demented maximimum overdrive than his more serious works.",1
"this is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like ""the corporation"" and ""fahrenheit 9/11."" its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature. the film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed - while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress.   truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children. bravo!  nb - this is also the only film (of 8) at varsity theaters (toronto) boasting a stick-on tag which reads... ""to arrange group viewings please contact...."" ... a further testament to the popularity and importance of this gem.  my bet... an academy award nomination for best documentary.  ob101",1

"its about time that gunga din is released on dvd. i cannot accurately say how many times i have watched this fine film but, i never tire of it. the lead actors worked so well together. victor mclaglen (sgt mcchesney), cary grant (sgt cutter) and douglas fairbanks jr (sgt ballentine) are an unbeatable team.  i just cannot get over their exploits in india. your first glimpse at the sergeants three, is when you see them engaged in fighting with other soldiers over a so-called treasure map. the three sergeants are sent on an expedition to find out what happened to the communications line an they enter a mostly deserted town- or so they think.  they engage in the necessary repairs and soon find a few ""residents"" in hiding. soon after they get attacked by a group of madmen and barely make an escape back to base.  later they are sent on another mission which gives sgt cutter a chance to go hunting for the gold with din. they find the temple of gold and are trapped by the evil kali supporters. din is sent to fetch help and cutter gets captured. soon mcchesney and ballentine arrive with din, and they are too captured.  faced with being killed, they watch helplessly as their regiment comes to rescue them. the evil doers watch and are about to spring their surprise attack when a wounded din climbs onto the golden dome and blows his bugle which then alerts the british to the ambush. in doing this, din is shot dead.  the soldiers attack the evil ones and soon defeat them. at the end, din is honored as he is made an honorary corporal in the british army.",1

"a broke would be screenwriter and his would be agent (tom wood and arye gross) are forced to live in a self storage facility run by an eccentric and intimidating manager (ron perlman) whom they come to believe is the serial murderer that is terrorizing the city, the ""costume killer"" (so named because, after injecting his victims with windex, he dresses them in silly costumes). they convince him his life story would make a great film and gather together a group of misfit wannabe film makers (john considine, joe pantoliano, kristy swanson) and discover that the art of movie making can be murder.  there is more to this movie but it was unfortunately left on the editing room floor and it shows (rumor is the studio wanted a ""lighter"" dark comedy). our loss (and the actors, who all do fine jobs and deserve better) as this has the makings of an exceptional black comedy but only rises to mediocre cute.  if you're a ron perlman fan this is absolutely worth getting just for his performance. his comedic timing is excellent and he has the chance to do some really great impressions (he wasn't kidding when he said on the hellboy movie commentary that he needed an intervention when he gets into jerry lewis mode). he's just simply fun to watch in this one.   david dukes also shines in a two-scener (but pivotal) role.",0

"i don't pretend to be an authority on actors who have played othello, but i've never witnessed a performance of the play, on film or on stage, wherein othello was portrayed with more humanity and authenticity.  according to the biographical notes, fishburne never received any professional training as an actor. perhaps this explains why his acting, in this beautifully edited film, comes over as so believable and so powerful. instead of chewing the scenery in the approved fashion for such high-powered roles, fishburne's portrayal is focused more on othello's love for his wife, and on his profound sadness at her supposed betrayal, than on violence and vengeance. in a word, the performance is understated, and made far more impressive by fishburne's extremely intelligent interpretation than it otherwise would have been.  the acting throughout is superb, and the (abridged) speeches gain grace from their light editing.

"this is an incredible film. i can't remember the last time i saw a swedish movie this layered. it's funny, it's tragic, it's compelling, and most of all it's a slice of swedish small town life. it crushes the clichés, and dwells deeper. it makes you feel connected, not only to the main characters, but to all the characters.  big city girl tracing back to her roots, her small hometown, to celebrate her father's 70th birthday, crossing paths with people she hasn't met in several years. although the story itself isn't unique, it offers a fresh approach. the center of the story is the relationship between three sisters (on different stages in life), who aren't very close. or at least don't realize how close they are.  one key reason that makes it so easy to connect to the people in this film is the immaculate cast. first, i'm more than pleased about the fact that there are absolutely no so-called 'a-list' swedish actors in this film. usually there is a handful of actors that has the ability to find their way into almost every major production in sweden. this time the production company managed to keep it real by casting actors who actually seem to love their profession. sofia helin is probably the first swedish actress since eva röse to prove that you don't need words to convey an emotion.  the writing is also very appealing. the dialogue is more than believable, and compared with other swedish films from the past year or two, it's ahead by miles. maria blom controls everything from the beginning, and if you didn't know, you would never guess that this is her first time writing and directing a feature length film. i can't wait for her next one.  once you start watching this, you really want to see it through.",1

"lets first start this review with the fact that i signed up just to write the review and warn people to save their money!!  this was one of the worst pieces of trash i have seen since the hulk. the storyline was the most predictable garbage you could possibly come up with. if you are expecting 24 but on the big screen, flush that expectation down the toilet immediately along with the money you would use for a ticket.. you may get more enjoyment that way. the acting was terrible, the plot was completely unrealistic, (along with the so called ""twist"" in the end. i must say this.. the ending did surprise me. i am not referring to the plot twist that surprised me, but instead the effortless manner that they put together what could be considered the only scene of somewhat decent action in the entire movie. they rushed the ending so quickly that i didn't even realize that it was over until i saw the credits rolling and at that point i considered burning the reel of film if i could just figure out how to get into that screening room.  casting was awful for a few reasons. first of all, they must have accidentally switched the character assignments, because michael douglas played the roll that clearly keifer sutherland should have been playing. while douglas was sneaking around agents, tapping phone lines, hacking into systems and taking out people who are chasing after him, sutherland plays the less capable agent who is always in a bad mood even when things aren't going that badly for him. he plays a very bland agent, nothing like his jack bauer type roll us 24 fans love.  i can just about promise you that this movie will disappoint in all areas. it can be best compared to a remake of the ""the fugitive"" / ""in the line of fire"" but written by people with mental disabilities",0
"diego armando maradona had been sixteen years of age in 1978 when argentina won the world cup at home. he was already the biggest star, and the greatest player in a country obsessed with football. everybody had begged cesar luis menotti to play the boy genius, but the manager thought that he was not yet ready.  history records that argentina won the 1978 world cup fairly convincingly - they hadn't really needed maradona. the same was not true in 1982. spain was a catalogue of disaster for argentina. menotti - still chain smoking - played diego this time, but the occasion was too much for such a temperamental boy. maradona had signed for barcelona on june 4 1982 for around $7 million - nine days later he played his first game at the camp nou and belgium beat argentina one-nil. it was not an auspicious debut, and even though he scored twice against hungary in the next match, maradona will remember the mundial as the site of his nadir - a crude, petulant foul on brazil's batista in the second round that abruptly ended his tournament and argentina's reign as world champions.  but now that was all behind him. maradona had muddled his way through some crazy times at barca, and left in 1984 to join napoli. it was as if he was finally home. the neapolitan tifosi had done everything to entice maradona to poor, underachieving napoli. gifts from old women and pocket money from young boys nestled uncomfortably with the camorra's millions as part of the transfer fee, and the city was determined to make him feel at home. so, for the time being at least, maradona was el rey - he brought his argentine side to mexico as one of the favourites, and with a new manager - carlos bilardo replacing menotti.  maradona is the hero of this story, a one-man world cup winning machine. in 1982, hundreds of young men had died in a pointless battle for the falkland isles; now the british press yearned for a rematch (with the same result) in mexico city. maradona was still regarded with distinction in england, remembered more for a superb performance in britain during a 1980 tour than for spain. but he was still an argie: the enemy.  england actually started well, and lineker could have scored after only twelve minutes. a key event happened on 8 minutes. fenwick, the big and limited english defender, was booked - he was now terrified of making any challenges around the penalty area.  after a tense first 45 minutes, the second half started with a bang. maradona danced forward after 50 minutes, but could find no way through. similarly valdano's attempt hit only white shirts. then the moment of infamy that serves as diego's epitaph. hodge bizarrely hooked the ball back into his own penalty area, shilton hurriedly jumped to claim - but there was maradona, somehow rising above the english goalkeeper to thrust the ball into the net. how had he done it? simple: handball.  the most famous foul in football history passed in near slow motion. every spectator waited for mr al-sharif of syria to blow for the foul (he didn't). shilton looked and appealed to the linesman - he ran back to the centre circle. unless he assassinates the pope, or becomes the first man to step foot on mars, when the great man dies this moment will be shown first - in long, lingering, slow motion, followed by the look of glee on his face. the next image will be his next gift to the world - the world cup's finest goal.  burruchaga stroked the ball to maradona who was ambling around on the right hand side of his own half. he span, and accelerated away from beardsley and reid. this was the real diego - he burst through butcher and attacked fenwick. fenwick now had the opportunity to stop the attack. normally, he would have aimed his boot somewhere near maradona's thigh - sure he would have picked up a red card, but who cares? then fenwick had a brainwave - he hesitated, and decided to run at maradona waving his arms - perhaps he was trying to put him off? diego shot into the box as fenwick fell over. butcher had been running alongside the genius as if he was offering encouragement. shilton charged out in panic, and maradona twisted around him and prepared to score. now butcher remembered his role and tried to cripple the argentinean - instead he gave extra impetus to the shot, which smashed into the goal. england were coming home.  during this magical mexican summer, the world had found a successor for pele. in fact the greatest ever footballer had been surpassed - pele had been superb in 1958 and 1970, but had had great players all around him. maradona did not. 1986 was his world cup.",1
i really can't say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasn't already been said. i haven't seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me. i have been searching for it every where. i have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty. last night i was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but i was only about 10 or 12 when i last saw it and i wasn't even sure if i had the right movie name so i decided to do another search and i finally found this sight. i was right. if any one knows where i can get a copy of this wonderful movie to share with my family could you please let me now at tawnyteel@yahoo.com i would really appreciate it. and to anyone who has not seen this movie and has the chance to it is well worth it.,1

"when i was 11, grease 2 was like crack. it was a classless, shameful, euphoric, and powerfully addictive experience. my sister and i would watch it, rewind it, and watch it over again and again and again until we passed out or became too confused and hostile to stand one another. so, if you are an 11-year old girl, and you reviewed this film as ""brilliant"" or ""fun"" or ""better than the original grease,"" you have your fledgling adolescent hormones to blame and you can rest assured that this unyielding fixation with utter rubbish will pass.  if, however, you are not a little girl, you have absolutely no excuse to suggest that grease 2 was anything but an inane, artless, slipshod embarrassment for all who participated in its production, distribution, and/or consumption.  for the sake of criticism, i will dignify the film now by explaining why it blows   1. in a well-executed musical, the songs should advance the narrative or develop the characters. in grease 2, with a few debatable exceptions, to the music is obscenely pointless. most of the songs appear to relate gimped innuendo about sex in an excessive and general way (""score tonight,"" ""reproduction,"" ""do it for our country,"" and ""prowlin'"") without making one concrete statement about any of the film's characters or themes. plus, all of the music is uncomfortably stupid and no one in the cast demonstrates even the crudest semblance of an ability to sing or dance.  2. the t-birds should be badass, and if not at least somewhat likable, but instead each of them is an annoying wussy-dufus-loser. in the end, when johnny nogerelli offers michael the sacred t-bird jacket and initiates him into the gang, michael should kick it to the ground, spit on it, and duck away to fervently scrub any part of his body that was touched by it. but of course, he accepts it as if it is gold because despite the fact that they are a bunch of bumbling meatheads, there is no greater honor than to be one with the t-birds.   3. since michael is beautiful, smart, kind, resourceful, and above average in everyway (his musical impotence notwithstanding), it is feasible that stephanie would ultimately embrace him when he reveals himself to be the man behind the mask. stephanie, on the other hand, is a slovenly, slack-jawed, bubble gum smacking, dirty sweatshirt wearing, gracelessly rude and trashy dingbat. so aside from being pretty (i guess), she harbors no likable characteristics, thus, audiences are given no justification whatsoever for the depth of michael's attraction to her.  i could go on and on, but i didn't want to mention the gross inferiority to its predecessor since there are apparently so many cranks out there who seem to feel that such a comparison is unfair. i will say this though, to those of you who think you want to revisit this mess for old time's sake: grease 2 is an experience akin to re-living your first kiss. only you are 32 now and kissing a snot-nosed 13-year old kid with acne and slobby braces. the magic is gone and you are left feeling dirty and disturbed. trust me.",0

"ok, so mr. agrama's company (which is involved in some dubious business with former italian pm silvio berlusconi) produced a horrendous mish-mash by a mr. carl macek.  what is this horrendous mish-mash i'm talking about? well, macek took three entirely unrelated japanese sci-fi animated series (namely, macross, southern cross and mospeada), added tons of dialogue - believing firmly that the american audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence - , edited the whole lot heavily for violent content, added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo, dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting hell (reba west's singing was - and still is - unbearable and a total outrage, especially compared to mrs. mari iijima)... and the result was an 85-episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holes.  of course, the mecha were cool to look at (especially those in the ""macross saga"") and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good. but whatever was good about robotech was not the result of macek's work or the ""voice talents"" he recruited. it was because of the toils and efforts of the (uncredited - why? would i be too bold to accuse hg of plagiarism here?) japanese creators. those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to robotech now wish we had never been exposed to robotech. the originals are so much better, naturally, and make a lot more sense.  robotech, however, did something worthwhile: it prompted legendary anime creator leiji matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of japanese anime creators' intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalled-for reworkings that talentless people like carl macek produce.",0
"i thought this movie was very well done. taking place in the mid 1950's, everything looked accurate to me. it was well cast and believable. i don't usually care much for this type of movie, because they just don't have any depth, but i felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt, you got to really know them and care about them. it did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time. this movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups. after the movie was over i wished there was a part two. i wanted to know what happened to dani and her family. this movie is bound to be a classic. if you haven't seen it you should try to catch it when it is on tv or rent it...",1
"this movie is probably the worst i have seen. bad acting, bad script, bad everything. comparing it to mainly two other movies in the same genre and from approximately the same time is interesting. both cyborg (van damme, 1989) and nemesis (olivier gruner, 1993) are much better and seems more robust in both story and directing and still it's albert pyun who has directed these two as well!  the story is not original. the world has become a terrible place, possibly due to an environmental disaster or a nuclear war, and people live under medieval circumstances. a special breed of robots (cyborgs) live on human blood and there's the story... the cyborgs need to get a lot of humans to fulfill there ""prophecy"" and the humans need someone to stop them. one girl together with a robot (kris kristofferson) built by the creator of the cyborgs has been appointed by destiny to save mankind.  in this movie the director tries some hong-kong stylish fighting scenes with the participants flying high and leaping far. the movie fails miserably in this attempt.  i recommend this film with the only reason that most people will get a new ""worst ever"" movie to relate to. and to fans of the genre i recommend ""cyborg"" since i think it's a very underestimated movie with quite a high entertaining factor. and if you can't stand van damme then check out ""nemesis"".  i rated this movie 1/10.",0
the setting and actors make this television movie for me the best rendition of dickens' classic tale. george c. scott is very believable as is the rest of the cast. his scrooge oozes with nastiness until the very end of the movie. then his character changes to one who is truly repentant. the 19th century english town chosen for the setting creates an ambiance that is fitting to dickens and adds to the plausibility of this film. it is a movie i watch every christmas along with the real grinch and it's a wonderful life.,1
"a fashion designer trips over a cat and falls into a pool, hitting her head on something floating on the surface. with rather cheesy effects (this was a tv movie) she floats up out of her body. she floats through a tunnel of rings of swirling orange smoke, and black rigid figures tip into her view (they look like the mannequins in her apartment). i almost thought i was watching a jess franco movie.... as her friends revive her, a black arm grabs her by the wrist, and she has to struggle to get loose. when she is revived, she remembers everything, and has a nasty bruise on her forearm.  shortly thereafter, she nearly gets hit by an out-of-control car that comes up on the sidewalk behind her. on halloween, she decides with her boyfriend to go to mexico for a vacation. when she gets there, she's surprised to find it's the day of the dead. they're annoyed by another american tourist who keeps following them, and he almost drowns them.  the designer is encouraged to join a group of people who've had near death experiences. they've all experienced the tunnel, but not the black figures or the repeated near escapes from death. one of them has, and he's very anxious. she's also encouraged to meet with a psychic.  a doctor tells her about people he calls ""walkers"" (the name of the novel this was based on). they're people who supposedly died of one cause that, when examined, prove to have died of another cause. thus it's like they continued walking around after dying until they died again, but he blames it on poor record-keeping.  i watched this on the 102 minute video, and it felt awfully long. i can't imagine that there's actually a 192 minute version! perhaps if it was meant to be watched over two or more nights on tv it would better be watched that way than in one sitting.  i've only read one gary brandner novel, floater, and if it is representative of his work, he's not the most original of writers. floater had the common plot of: picked on kid kills people in revenge. even the variation was pretty common: picked on kid dies and kills people years later in revenge from beyond the grave. and in fact it has a point in common with this movie, in that the kid practices astral projection, and when he is drowned he floats up out of his body as here. i don't know how closely from the dead of night follows his novel walkers. i understand the howling movies don't bear much resemblance to his novels.  it's quite a slow movie, and the special effects and cinematography are really held down by the (presumably) low budget and made-for-tv shortcomings. there are a lot of easily recognizable character actors in it. it also feels very dated, more early to mid 1980s than 1989. i found it to be boring. a much better low-budget movie covering similar subject matter that i don't think has dated as badly is sole survivor (1983) (arguably the inspiration for the 2000s final destination movies). it blows from the dead of night away.",0
"""de vierde man"" (the fourth man, 1984) is considered one of the best european pycho thrillers of the eighties. this last work of dutch director paul verhoeven in his home country before he moved to hollywood to become a big star with movies like ""total recall"", ""basic instinct"" and ""starship troopers"" is about a psychopathic and disillusioned author (jeroen krabbe) going to the seaside for recovering. there he meets a mysterious femme fatale (renee soultendieck) and starts a fatal love affair with her. he becomes addicted to her with heart and soul and finds out that her three previous husbands all died with mysterious circumstances...  ""de vierde man"" is much influenced by the old hollywood film noire and the psycho thrillers of alfred hitchcock and orson wells. it takes much time to create a dark and gripping atmosphere, and a few moments of extreme graphic violence have the right impact to push the story straight forward. the suspense is sometimes nearly unbearable and sometimes reminds of the works of italian cult director dario argento.  the cast is also outstanding, especially krabbe's performance as mentally disturbed writer that opened the doors for his international film career (""the living daylights"", ""the fugitive""). if you get the occasion to watch this brilliant psycho thriller on tv, video or dvd, don't miss it!",1
this is a really nice and sweet movie that the entire family can enjoy. it's about two dogs and a cat who are taken away to live with someone else for a little while but the animals don't understand and they escape and go to find the family on their own. the cat is named sassy and she lives up to her name. chance is the younger dog who knows a lot about life on the inside of the pound. shadow is the older and wiser dog who senses things. put those three together on an adventure and it makes for a happy and fun filled time. there are no special effects of the mouths moving so it isn't cheesy at all. it's the best talking animal movie that i've seen so far. it's a really good movie for families.,1
"an ok movie about downs syndrome. a mother has twins one is very sick the other is good but he has downs. the mother does not think she can raise him so she gives him to some people who have 15 kids 11 have downs! the mom does not like this & she thinks he should be with his family ( i agree too ) so they take it to court & the family gets broken up & the grandparents lose, it never really says if the mom & daughter makeup? i think this movie's good but the plot is familiar, it's still good & has a few unintentional laughs!",1
"starting off, here's a synopsis: porno queen alta lee (lynn lowry) is murdered by her pornographer lover max (george shannon) in a game of sexual russian roulette. alta's other lover, icy lesbian casting agent camila stone (mary woronov), provides an alibi for max. but camila has an agenda of her own, and a plan involving the seduction of innocent actress julie (lynn again) in a web of sexual mind games. when the lookalikes' identities are sufficiently blurred, the stage is set for vengeance as passionate as the most heated carnal encounter.  though this movie is quite obscure and never got much attention, i find it to be a sexy, suspenseful gem. cult goddess woronov has one of her best-ever roles, and she and sexy-innocent lowry play off each other well. the unsettling music provided by gershon kingsley, plus two original songs (""all-american boy,"" ""you say you've never let me down"") and the jaynetts' ""sally, go 'round the roses"" compose a memorable soundtrack. theodore gershuny's direction is sharp, with everything photographed in muted earth tones that perfectly suggest unsavory business bubbling under society's upper crust. with tons of great new york atmosphere, ondine (woronov's friend and fellow warholite) giving a great performance in a small role, and exotic monique van vooren as max's ex-wife in a comic sub-plot. this sub-plot, though amusing, looks like it belongs in another movie altogether. however, i'm not complaining, as the film is smooth even as it changes gears and is a hell of a lot more interesting that the erotic-thriller garbage currently being cranked out.  trivia: sugar cookies was originally rated x (soft-core) and released by general film corporation in 1973. i am the proud owner of an original one-sheet poster--lucky me! in 1977, the movie was cut for an r and re-released by troma team, which now offers it uncut on videotape. mary woronov was the wife of theodore gershuny at the time, and was reportedly uncomfortable performing the graphic lesbian simulated sex scenes with him leering behind the camera. she can also be seen in two of his earlier productions, kemek (1970) and silent night, bloody night (1972).",1
"and this somebody is me. and not only me, as i can see here at imdb or when leaving the theater. why did the people love it? it's obvious: everybody knows zombies by now (at least the horror fans by heart and the others through the ""dawn of the dead"" reinvention or resident evil movies etc.)   or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies ... that is until this movie came along. and you'll see zombies in a new light (perhaps). this is not a horror movie, although it does contain some violent scenes, but is rather a comedy. a satire to be precise. and it never runs out of steam! that is why i rated it so high. pacing wise it's incredible, the acting is great and the script has no (obvious) mistakes ... quite the contrary: it's a gem and if you're only a little bit interested in zombies you ought to see it! and even if you dislike them, watch it! because it's a great (comedy) movie!",1

"...not that all disney films are garbage.  anyway, i saw ""legend of boggy creek"" first and absolutely loved the film. when i heard it had 2 sequels, i was ecstatic. i finally found a copy of this and watched it one night. i don't see how they can make a g-rated sequel to a horror film. the original is a movie/documentary about the fauke monster, and can scare anyone. ""return"" is for kids and should not be watched by anyone. i don't remember the plot too well, as it's been quite some time since i watched it and i will not watch it again, but... it's about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill bigfoot. three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them. a big monsoon comes through. the hunters get hurt, are saved by the kids. then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm. then all of a sudden, bigfoot comes and does something really sick. i don't wanna ruin the ending for any of yas, but it's not scary. well....",0

"note to previous reviewer: this movie is ""science-fiction adaptation of the iliad"" according to the screenwriter. so whether the references are painful or not, no apologies, it is the basis for the film. they admit they stole...though adapted is the p.c. term.  great flick but too short. probably didn't come out as well as the author, director, or studio wanted, but pretty damn fun. the fact that the studio itself imploded during the making only helps add to its legacy.  a big-budget remake wouldn't be as fun, and probably wouldn't do the screenplay any more justice. but it's fun to dream about the potential there. a dvd release with some meager extras is apparently available but i don't think it would play on ntsc players. i'm no expert and thus still trying to figure this out. for now, i live with the vhs incarnation.",1
"it may be the remake of 1987 autumn's tale after eleven years, as the director mabel cheung claimed. mabel employs rock music as the medium in this movie to express her personal attitude to life, in which love, desire and the consequential frustration play significantly crucial roles. rock music may not be the best vehicle to convey the profound sentiment, and yet it is not too inappropriate to utilize it as the life of underground rock musicians is bitterly more intense than an ordinary one. the director focuses on the depiction of subtle affection and ultimate vanity of life rather than mere rock music. the love between father and son, lovers, and friends is delicately and touchingly delivered through the fine performance. mabel does not attempt to beautify rock musicians as artists at all, instead, she tries to reproduce a true life on screen, making huge efforts of years' working on this project and gathering information in beijing underground pubs.  daniel has given probably the best performance in all his movies made so far. his innate dispiritedness and reticence fit the blue mood of the film perfectly.",1
"with a title like ""attack of the killer tomatoes!"", anyone going into this thing would be expecting either a) a bad science fiction movie or b) a comedy making fun of bad science fiction movies. it's supposed to be a mix of both, with a dose of parody splashed in. unfortunately, it falls flat very soon.  you're never supposed to take this movie seriously, i realize that, but you're supposed to think it's funny, right? i found only a few of the jokes or situations were funny (i.e, the side-by-side phone conversations, the russian olympic spy eating steroid cereal, superman walking by lois, etc.). ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" strives to be a cult classic, but it doesn't make it. a cult classic is a movie that is so different that only a select group of people understand it (or a similar description). ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" could be enjoyed by any 8-year-old with a bad sense of humor, so therefore, it does not qualify as a cult film.  there is one good actress in the entire thing: sharon taylor as lois fairchild. she is a thin, gawky reporter, but has an endearing personality, loves to overact, and is a natural comedienne. unfortunately, she is put to bad use here.  ""attack of the killer tomatoes"" is not as funny as, say, ""amazon women on the moon"" or ""kentucky fried movie"", but it does have a few hilarious moments, so i would still recommend seeing it once. avoid the director's cut, it has interruptions by the producer of the movie and some supposedly ""lost"" footage dubbed in a pretend african dialect (it can be found in english on the out of print tape).",0
"anyone who doesn't like this film is one who is afraid to explore his or her own demons. this film does make the viewer a little uncomfortable at times, but that is its intention. it asks you to look at your own life and confront the obstacles head on like lou eventually does. it asks you to overcome the fear of perception and become who you are meant to be. bret carr holds up a mirror unlike any filmmaker has. the intention and the message is clear and profound. people's apprehension about this film stems only from their own insecurities. an open-minded viewer takes this inspirational message and runs with it. sometimes a life- changing realization does come in a flash -- a light bulb going on. this story is real and changes the lives if its viewers in a real way.",1
"i rented this by mistake. i thought, after a cursory examination of the box, that this was a time-travel/sci-fi story. instead, it's a ""christian"" story, and i suppose is fairly typical example. if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot/acting/etc., but i found it rather painful.   i have to admit that i'm bothered by the rewriting of history in this story. it paints the 1890's as some sort of paradise of family values and morality (a character is aghast that 5% of marriages end in divorce!), but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this ""highly moral"" society (rigid racial, sexual, and social discrimination were widespread, for instance). and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women's clothing styles (as reported in a recent wsj).  overall, thought, i suppose that it's the sort of thing you'll like if you like this sort of thing, and it's certainly wholesome...",0
"saturday june 3, 6:30pm the neptune  monday june 5, 4:30pm the neptune  few celebrations of ethnic and cultural identity succeed as mightily as carlos saura's brilliant interpretation of isaac albeniz' masterpiece iberia suite. at the approach of its centennial, saura drew together an unprecedented wealth of talent from the spanish performing arts community to create this quintessential love song to their homeland. the twelve ""impressions"" of the suite are presented without narrative in stark surroundings, allowing the power of each performance to explode before saura's camera. creative use of large flats and mirrors, moved throughout the set, combined with screens, shadows, fire, rain and rear projection add glorious dramatic effects to the varied selections of song, dance and instrumental performance. photographs of albeniz reappear throughout the program, connecting the passion of the music to its great creator. saura encompasses all spaniards on his stage from the beautiful elegance of elderly flamenco dancers in traditional costume to children joyously dancing with their instructors.",1
"you believe in god or you don't. you believe in jesus or you don't. you believe he is the son of god or you don't. the choice is up to you.  director denys arcand has really done everything he could to bring back jesus to a mere historic figure, social worker, son of two humans, instead of the son of god the holy spirit and mary, who opened heaven again for us. encouraging the big bang, a world come from evolution, instead of seeing the beauty of creation. the film depicts a theologian bringing some ""modern findings"" to the actor who plays jesus in the passion play, who happily incorporates them in his play.  the depicted priest who runs the sanctuary where the passion play is performed in montreal has a sexual relation with one of the female players of the passion play instead of showing his love for god through celibacy. more often than not the director's abhorrence of the church is clearly visible.  the director has tried to make a parallel between jesus' life and the passion play actor's life. this is an admirable attempt, but depicting the resurrection with the transplantation of the passion play actor's organs in other bodies signifies how the director thinks about jesus.  my opinion is not important, god's opinion is, but i wouldn't want to stand in the shoes of the director and actors when standing before jesus' throne.",0
"i remember rather enjoying this a few years back but coming to it again, i wonder why. i guess it always looks good and the girls do rather well but the men do rather let the side down. why oh why in so many english films about sex do we have to have such inept men along side the pretty girls? what is more this begins predictably enough as a sex farce similar in vein to the confessions films but about a third of the way through (whilst we are beginning to enjoy the presence of the lovely me me lai) the film asks us to start taking it seriously. not only that but the central rock club and cannabis sequences are very forced and just look stilted. in short this is neither as innocently silly or as intelligently serious as it seems to intend. richard o'sullivan maybe, as such a central figure, could have helped but i reckon this to be one of his worst performances. just worth it for the ladies.",0

"with the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with hb warner on the celestial train, this was 94 minutes of jaw-dropping horribleness! the acting was atrocious, but the story is what i really found appalling. the acting was wooden and stilted, even by early talkies standards (the exceptions being lee tracy and hb warner, neither of whom can do wrong). rose hobart was absolutely horrid and lifeless as julie (as she likewise was in 1932's dr jekyll and mr hyde, an otherwise excellent flick). and the rest of the cast was worse, there being no words to describe their awfulness.   worse than the acting, however, was the story. for some unknown reason, julie loves liliom, a cad and user of women with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. he marries julie but doesn't support her, instead lying in bed all day or hanging out with his low-life criminal pal (lee tracy). and, oh yeah, he never has a kind word to say to julie and he regularly beats her. julie loves him nonetheless and continually makes excuses for him, which only seems to make him more abusive. what's even sicker is that this movie presents this story to us as a love story. somehow we are supposed to see julie as a noble character whose pure love redeems liliom. wtf?   the last 1/3 of this movie takes place after liliom has killed himself (a robbery plot goes awry and liliom plunges a knife into himself rather than being taken in by the police). as he lay dying, he tells julie ""i beat you all the time, but i'm not sorry for it."" when he at last dies, she finally tells him she loves him. (neither character ever said ""i love you"" to the other while they were alive.) after his death, god's chief magistrate gives liliom one more day on earth so that he can ""do something good"" for his unborn daughter. the price for this is 10 years in hell. after 10 years, liliom is allowed one day on earth to see his now 10-yr-old daughter. he approaches her in the front yard of her home and tries to cajole her into letting him ""do something good"" for her; he tries to get her to play cards, he tries to give her gabriel's horn, but she's not interested and rebuffs him. so he slaps her. he. slaps. her. and then he disappears back to the afterlife. looking on, we see his daughter tell julie about this. the girl says the slap didn't hurt, that it felt like a kiss. this is supposed to be the movie's magical moment. the girl asks her mother if such a thing is possible, and julie replies that ""someone can be beat you and beat you and beat you and not hurt you at all."" then the music swells and liliom rides up to heaven in the celestial train. blech!   there was one saving grace to this film, and that is the interview between the chief magistrate (hb warner was truly magnificent here) and liliom on the celestial train. the magistrate had some very profound things to say to liliom about life and second chances and death. this scene alone made me bump this rating from 1 to 2 stars. regarding liliom's suicide as a means for escaping his problems, the magistrate says ""people suppose that when they die, their difficulties are ended for them. you thought that by killing yourself that you would cancel all your responsibilities. it is not as simple as that. on earth your name is still spoken; your face is still remembered. as long as one is left who remembers you, so long is the matter unended. until you have been completely forgotten, you will not be finished with the earth, even though you are dead."" some great sublime transcendental stuff amongst some of the most horrible trash i've ever seen.   by the way, this story has apparently been filmed many times both as ""liliom"" and as the musical ""carousel.""",0

"after seeing the ""batman dead end"" short, i didn't know what to really expect from world's finest. of course, superman and batman. all my world's finest comic books have them as the team-up.  after seeing this 3-and-a-half minute trailer, it made me wish someone would make a serialized fan film for world's finest, if not an actual full-length film.  sure, some of the superman stuff was cheesy, but movie trailers in theaters are always teasers, giving you only certain aspects of the entire product. this looks like it needs a complete product.  other than director sandy collera's relative playing an achingly poor perry white, most of the actors were unknown. if an actual movie was made, actors would be cast to fit the bill for the film, though i believe nina kaczorowski would make a good lois lane, especially if given closer-to-the-character dialogue.  good to see clark bartram wearing the batman costume from dead end, but it should be updated a bit more and not be like the 40s batman with the 80s-90s leather cape and cowl. his demeanor is batman-like, but i still wonder about the validity of white contact lenses instead of just allowing his eyes to show through the mask. i believe the goal was to get it as close to the comic character than the movie persona.  michael o'hearn cannot play superman, period. he stands around with a goofy look on his face that simply says, ""slap me."" and line delivery seems to be a problem with him.  overall, though, i would love to see a complete story and film based on this ingenious piece of work. there was a rumor about a world's finest movie being made, and with the correct additions to the script, this could be it. hope more like this are made.",1

"i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together, the talk is not of the master's great films like ""north by northwest"" or ""strangers on a train"", but a lesser-known effort like this one from 1931, obscure and seriously flawed, which showcases the great director in fledgling form.  emily and fred hill (joan barry and harry kendall) are a middle-class london couple scrimping to stay ahead. he begrudges their lot; she accepts it. change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle, saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury. they make plans for a world cruise. but their problems have only begun.  just ask richard hannay, roger o. thornhill, or marion crane. well, marion's indisposed at the moment, but you get the idea. travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight, setting one up for a perilous journey at best. this is perhaps hitchcock's earliest foray into this theme, and not his most successful or memorable. hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element, in this case domestic drama rather than suspense, but the two do not cohere, at least not here.  the hills are a dull, flat couple, with no chemistry or personality. when they find themselves at the folies bergère, in the form of cross-cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film, they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers. ""the curtain's gone up too soon!"" gasps emily. ""they aren't dressed.""  when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise, it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing, even if the people they partner off with are drips, too. emily's man, gordon (percy marmont) carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs, which he suggests be filled by emily. fred's girl ""the princess"" (betty amann) has clara bow's eyes and wallace beery's five o'clock shadow. there's also an obnoxious fellow passenger, a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue. subtlety was still to come.  everything is shot in an abrupt manner, with confusing blocking and strained dialogue. hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn't come off, and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears. when fred and emily break off, they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged-together rickshaws, one of many clunky attempts at symbolism.  emily's the only vaguely sympathetic character, in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon, but mostly because she's among the first of hitchcock's many magnetic blondes, her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film's conclusion.  matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set-piece for the protagonists to come to grips with, and presumably repair their relationship. only they aren't active participants in the resolution, and except for the fate of a friendly cat, nothing about the ending resonates.  at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s, and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food. ""rich and strange"" is hitchcock paying his dues, and learning his trade, one for scholars but not casual film goers.",0
"i know i should like this film, and i do for the most part, but as other's have mentioned, it is a bit long in the tooth. i to also found the raging hormones of the all male crew to be a bit annoying. it's a wonder they didn't start panting and howling at the moons as well. i also have to say that overall, the movie leaves me cold. it's a very sterile atmosphere that permeates the film. on the plus side the effects are great (besides the cartoon monster), as are the effects, props, costumes and of course robbie. if the robot was not in this film, i don't think it would have been as popular as it was/is. the second half of the movie picks up steam once we start to investigate the forgotten gadgets of the ""krell."" as many times as i've seen this movie, the krell still leaves me scratching my head as to exactly who or what they were. based on what was being produced at that time, besides ""this island earth,"" forbidden planet is miles above the average sci-fi movies of the time. being filmed in color also adds to its enjoyment. certainly a classic in its own right, flaws and all, and deservedly so.",1
"how can there be that many corrupt cops without any one of them slipping up? with enough cops to run a mini-war that include such weapons as flamethrowers, you would think they would have been caught before someone writing for a weekly coupon newspaper overheard someone saying 'thanks' to a corrupt cop.  you will never get your 90ish minutes back. life is too precious to rent this movie.  i feel bad for the big named actors that made the mistake of making this movie.  if you like justin timberlake, feel free to rent this movie. he does have a very major part in it, so fans might enjoy seeing him.   however, i believe most of his fans are young girls, who may be turned off by the violence in this movie.",0
"demonicus rocked, you guys need to understand how hard it rocked, unfortunately, the words needed to explain the extent of the rocking have not been discovered. for a tiny idea, pop like 50 hits of e, watch death factory while on the phone with jesus, wait, jesus is on call waiting, you're having phone sex with will smith on the primary line. seriously, that movie... so good. you need to watch it at least a 4 times to catch all the subtleties... well, not so much subtleties as much as it takes the length of the movie, times 4 in order to ponder why the people at full moon are allowed to a, live, and b, reproduce. what is our world coming to?",1
"if you've ever been harassed on the underground by a christian who says, ""jesus is the answer. what's the question?"", then perhaps you should thank god if you've never met a lacanian. slavoj zizek, the most evangelical of lacanians, would surely exchange the word ""jesus"" in that statement for ""lacan/hegel"".  zizek's star burns brightly at the moment, no doubt because we generally view films and pop culture purely as entertainment for our consumption. so it seems impressive when someone - anyone - comes along and says, ""hang on, films may say something about ourselves.""  the ideas zizek expounds in this film are ""true"" purely because he says so. for example, zizek explains that three marx bros are the ego, superego and id (god knows what happened to zeppo, or gummo  perhaps they're the sinthome...or is that movies themselves?). this is simply what they are. in zizek's output, culture is not there to be investigated but merely to be held as an example of his ideology. people may object that he certainly has something to say - but how different is what he says from the christian attributing everything to god's will?  what's wrong with taking examples, from films or anywhere, to illustrate theory? well, nothing at all. as zizek seems to believe, they may even serve as a proof. however, it is merely cant and propaganda when these examples are isolated from their context. without context, you can say and prove anything you want. for zizek, lacan is the answer  so he goes and makes an example of it. everything but everything resembles the teachings of the master and culture is there to bear this out, to serve this ideology. for instance, zizek's exemplar of the fantasy position of the voyeur is taken from a scene in vertigo when jimmy stewart spies on kim novak in a flower shop. but, in the context of the film, this is not a voyeur's fantasy position at all. stewart has been deliberately led there by novak. this presentation of examples isolated from their context continues throughout zizek's two hour and a half cinematic sermon.  his analysis of the ""baby wants to f---"" scene in blue velvet is laughable. touching lightly on what he appears to consider to be the horrific (to the masculine) truth of ""feminine jouissance"", zizek says that isabella rossilini's character not only demands her degradation but is, unconsciously, in charge of the situation. this is an example of her ""jouissance"". well ... possibly. but - sorry to be prosaic - where is the evidence for this? in the film, she partially undergoes her humiliations because hopper has kidnapped her son. zizek may object that she also evidently enjoys rough sex with kyle maclachalan. but this may be due to any number of things. isn't that the point of so-called feminine ""jouissance""? according to lacan, feminine jouissance, unlike phallic jouissance, cannot be articulated, it is beyond the phallic capture and castration of language. if this is right, then no example can be made of it. it also means that the entire concept is non-sensical and entirely mystical. it can only be designated by dogmatists such as zizek: ""there's feminine jouissance for you! why is this feminine jouissance? because i say so.""   what example can really be garnered from these films? only zizek's psychology. why does he keep inserting himself into his favourite films, even to the point that, when in a boat on botega bay, he says he wants to f--- rod steiger too? is this not the wish-fulfilment of someone who spends his life critiquing films? as the saying goes, freud would have a field day with the pervert's guide to the cinema - but with zizek himself, nobody else.  zizek's theory that films show us how we desire may be right on the face of it, but these films cannot be strict universal examples of psychoanalytical laws. this film illustrates how zizek desires and only extremely vaguely - as to be almost useless - how the rest of us desire. for, as any psychoanalyst knows, how we desire and what we desire cannot be fully separated - and cannot be easily universalised, if at all. zizek's love of making everything an example of lacan's answer bears this out: how do we desire? like this, this is how i do it. problem is, in zizek's desire, everything and everyone else is rationalised into his desire. but zizek is a leninist and they certainly don't like letting the ""subject"" speak for itself.  the pervert's guide to the cinema is a summation zizek's love of dogma and is entirely unphilosophical even if it remains very political (what dogma isn't?). zizek has never questioned exactly what his motives might be when embarking on an analysis, what he is trying to discover, because the terms of his exploration, and therefore his ethics in doing so, are never put into question.  zizek is extremely prolific but all his books and this film say the same thing. he's a kind of henry ford of cultural theory: mass-production and any colour as long as it's black. he is perfect for today's highly consumerist society: supposedly critical while giving people the same c-ap over and over and pretending that it is something different. this is popular because people largely prefer readymade answers to their problems - which capitalism always claims to provide - rather than investigating things with any serious consideration at all. which is kind of like being brain dead. for me, zizek's third matrix pill is a suicide capsule.  ps: i loved zizek's solemn remark - presented as a revelation about cinema and humanity - that music in films can greatly affect people's sympathies. did this only occur to zizek after he watched jaws?",0
"there be very little doubt that hg wells is the most influential writer of the 20th century . jules verne has some claim to be the father of science fiction but his stories were more adventure stories using marvellous inventions as plot devices . wells was profound and brought subtext to his tales . perhaps his greatest legacy is that there's very little if any evidence that people believed in life on other planets before the 20th century where as now many people including richard dawkins consider it a near certainty . there's no evidence of this of course and one can't help wondering that is was wells who introduced this to human thinking ? undoubtedly it was wells that planted the seed .  things to come was adapted by wells himself from his own novel . it is rather obvious however that he is unable to tell the difference between the technicalities of writing novels and writing screenplays . the dialouge is often laden , heavy handed and unconvincing . one case in point is the two pilots from opposing sides discussing the nature of war "" why must we murder one another . why ? "" this mirrors the criticism , near naked contempt that orwell had of wells in his essay wells , hitler and the world state and it is true that wells anti-war message is painfully overstated . it'd be impossible to believe a conversation taking place between an raf pilot and his opposite number in the luftwaffe a few years later   that said it is absolutely fascinating watching a film from 1935 predicting a world wide war taking place in 1940 that heralds the end of civilisation . there's a striking and haunting imagery as a child bangs a drum as a phantom army marches in the background and the collapse of society and the fear of the wanderng sickness is wonderfully realised . even the rather lazy storytelling of showing the year of the setting has a compelling nature it's the images that makes this film along with arthur bliss score that makes the film so memorable . and to be fair wells does ask the question "" the universe or nothing . what shall it be ? "" . in short this is a film whose flaws are easy to forgive",1
"you don't expect much from a prc picture, and with rare exceptions--mainly from edgar g. ulmer and a few by joseph h. lewis or lew landers--that's exactly what you get: not much. this ""epic"" about nazis in africa trying to incite an arab revolt against the british isn't much different. the script, by longtime prc hacks arthur st. claire and sherman lowe, is trite, laughable, full of unfunny ""wisecracks"" and plot holes the size of outer mongolia. the direction, by longtime prc no-budget specialist al herman, is semi-comatose at best. the performances, though--except for spectacularly incompetent and irritatingly hammy lead walter woolf king--aren't really half bad. veteran comedian parkyakarkus is actually the best thing about the film. he plays a guy from brooklyn masquerading as a razor-blade salesman and brightens up the screen considerably when he shows up. he's got great comic timing, charm to spare and seems to be having a heck of a good time. duncan renaldo is fairly convincing as an arab sheik--despite his spanish accent--and veteran bad guy george j. lewis as renaldo's arab rival does his usual fine job of villainy, even if he goes a bit over the top sometimes. joan woodbury is quite pretty and has a nice light touch, and she and renaldo have great chemistry together, although--like the rest of the cast--she has none at all with king. h.b. warner, whose career stretched back to the silent era, lends a shred of dignity to the low-rent proceedings, even though he blows his lines several times and, prc being prc, they weren't cut out. there's a great deal of stock footage spliced in from a big-budget silent movie with a similar arab theme--although i have no idea which one it is--and, prc being prc, no effort was made to try to make it inconspicuous: i've seldom seen stock footage that was so blatantly obvious.  ""a yank in libya"" isn't very good, of course--well, ok, it stinks--but it would be worth a look just to see parkyakarkus in his prime. i had heard of him and knew that he was the father of actor/director albert brooks and super dave osborne, but had never actually seen him in anything before. it was worth watching this tenth-rate prc ""extravaganza"" just to see him in action. otherwise, forget it.",0
"don't get me wrong. ""goldeneye"" was revolutionary and is definitely the best fps game to be based on the 007 franchise. but the series had fallen into a fps rut. enter ""everything or nothing"", which puts bond in third-person. when i wrote my earlier review for ""from russia with love"", i had finished frwl and just started eon and judged eon a bit harshly. even though frwl definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise, eon definitely is superior in terms of in-depth controls and gameplay variety. missions range from standard running-and-gunning to driving an suv, driving an aston martin, driving a limousine that is wired to explode, commandeering two different types of tanks a la ""goldeneye"", riding a motorcycle, flying a helicopter, repelling down a shaft guarded by laser tripwires, and free falling after a plummeting damsel. sure, vehicle controls are a little clumsy, but the issue here is the variety.  as movie adaptations, ""goldeneye"" and frwl were all that i could have hoped for. but eon's original storyline adds to the feeling of controlling a james bond adventure. this is helped by the impressive cast list of willem defoe, shannon elizabeth, heidi klum, and misaki ito. judi dench and john cleese reprise their movie roles of m and q, respectively, and pierce brosnan, while no sean connery, adds credibility to the game's proceedings. all characters resemble the stars, with the disappointing exception of heidi klum, who's in-game model doesn't do the real-life model justice. mya's theme song is on par with at least some of the big screen bond title tunes.  the game also plays tribute to some of the older bond movies. willem defoe's character is a former colleague of christopher walken's baddie from ""a view to a kill"". richard kiel appears as jaws, the hulking henchman from ""the spy who loved me"" and ""moonraker"" in three fight scenes, the first and best of which proceeds in the same fashion a fight in the movies would have.  single-player gameplay mainly consists of standard on-foot missions as bond. like bond, you will be able to choose whether to use stealth or go out with guns blazing. the game provides plenty of opportunities to utilize stealth, with plenty of wall and object cover. unfortunately, unlike frwl, only one button in eon controls both crouching and wall clinging, so bond may end up crouching low when he's supposed to be peeking around a corner, and vice-versa. the game also allows players to go into ""bond reflex"" mode. while you browse your inventory, everything around you will go into super slo-mo, allowing you to analyze objects around you that can be interacted with. while this takes some getting used to, eventually this mode will allow you to perform many spectacular ""bond moments"", such as shooting down a chandelier to take out four goons underneath, and greatly add to the bond movie feeling.  there are 3 available difficulty levels: operative, agent, and double oh. on operative, you can breeze through in a few hours. on agent, a few weeks. on double oh, a few months. the difficulty level can be changed for each individual mission. garnering high scores on missions will unlock gold and platinum awards and effect features such as vehicle upgrades and the skimpy outfits the bond girls wear. some missions can be extremely frustrating due to a scarcity of checkpoints, but when all is said and done, no mission is any longer than a single action scene in a bond movie.  multi-player, unfortunately, is not as thrilling. ""goldeneye"" still has the best multi-player mode of any bond game. eon's main multi-player is a co-op campaign mode that puts players in charge of lesser mi6 agents on a less important mission than bond's. a more standard third-person death match can be unlocked from this mode. but the single-player mode is the most complete bond experience to date. the ending, as with most bond games, is anticlimactic. while the final mission is one of the most aggravating of the game, the final confrontation with the villain is disappointing. also, levels that require bond to be speedy become largely a matter of trial and error. still, for any serious bond fan, not playing this game is tantamount to missing one of the bond films.",1
"one of the cornerstones of low-budget cinema is taking a well-known, classic storyline and making a complete bastardization out of it. phantom of the mall is no exception to this rule. the screenwriter takes the enduring phantom of the opera storyline and moves it into a late '80s shopping mall. however, the ""phantom's"" goal now is simply to get revenge upon those responsible for disfiguring his face and murdering his family. the special effects do provide a good chuckle, especially when body parts begin appearing in dishes from the yogurt stand. pauly shore has a small role which does not allow him to be as fully obnoxious as one would expect, mostly due to the fact that his fifteen minutes of mtv fame had not yet arrived. if you're looking for a few good laughs at the expense of the actors and special effects crew, check this flick out. otherwise, keep on looking for something else.",0
"i've seen better teenage werewolf movies in my time, this one however, takes the cake. more comedy than horror, ""full moon high"" puts the ""c"" in cheese-fest. the star quality in this movie is not bad. just the way it was made just sends in rolling downhill. adam arkin plays tony, an all-american high school football player of the 50's who ends up not aging due to a werewolf bite in transylvania. the most annoying part of the movie was the violin player. he drove everyone batty! ed mcmahon plays his ultra-conservative father who met his end of his own bullet. adam's father alan plays a shrink who seems to be not top of his game. after all these years tony seems to be very out of place due to the attack, and then he'll get the chance to catch in his state. more laugh than blood shed, this movie is just a start in the 80's, ""teen wolf"" was an improvement from this! 1 out of 5 stars.",0
"just looking at the sets, staging and editing it is easy to tell this project lacked a proper budget. maybe bela lugosi is meant to take your mind off of things like that. young brides drop dead at the altar after saying ""i do"". their corpses are stolen by a renowned horticulturist dr. lorenz(lugosi)and a couple of his freakish minions as his aging wife(elizabeth russell)needs injections of the glandular fluids of the young virgins to remain forever young...forever beautiful. an eager local cub reporter(luana walters)realizes that each missing bride wore the same rare orchid to the altar; an orchid in which dr. lorenz would be most knowledgeable. a typical horror movie storm brews making a visit to the lorenz estate a bit spooky; especially with a dwarf and a slobbering hunchback on the premises. other players: angelo rossitto, tristram coffin, minerva urecal and frank moran.",0
"this is one of the worst action films i have ever seen. this is particularly due to much of the factual implausibility (like an obvious agent posing as a bank loan officer while making obvious that he is speaking to someone through a wire or the scene where the scientists assume it is safe to enter a room in which a virus has been released even though 'it has not found a viable host' does not mean that it will never find one), the cheap sets (the bank looks like it was poorly constructed to resemble a dungeon), and the bad acting. it is the story of an organized crime group that has successfully stolen a capsule of the lethal virus. however, the head honcho who decides to remove it from a bank security deposit box, does so at the same time a bank heist is going down, at the same fbi agents have been informed of this, and at the same time a terrible earthquake erupts. needless to say, the aftermath of the quake is messy in more ways than one. however, the results do not make for an enticing action film, but instead, one that has been obviously z-grade junk from the beginning of the film. (perhaps this is why some of the screen captures on the packaging look to be created with computer graphics rather than being actual screen captures from various sequences of the film). what the hell ron perlman was doing in this, i have no idea. i wonder if he was as embarrassed to be in it as i was to have watched it.",0

"i can't believe i actually watched this but i guess i just wanted to know if this movie would get unintentionally funnier and funnier towards the end. and it did. the climax was the poorest performance ever given by the defence lawyer - so out of real life that even for a fictional story it was far too weird. no way anyone on this planet can behave in front of a court like she did. and probably the worst prosecutor on earth. why was he in court anyway? he did nothing and absolutely nothing to prove her guilty. a simple search of her house would have resulted in the find of the rings. but no go. he preferred to say ""objection"" 2 or 3 times during the whole trial - that was it. the blonde lunatic was given a truth-drug to prove her innocent but not brett. the lunatic almost had an altar of brett in her home that could have proved her sick obsession. but again no go. during the court scene i felt the silent urge to take the needlepoint out of her hand and bang it several times against her head. even real weirdos do not look that silly fake ""i am innocent"" like she did. and what does this movie tell us? never marry a woman with a life insurance: as soon as she falls down the stairs her husband will be thrown into jail, guilty or not. evil, evil men.",0
"this well conceived and carefully researched documentary outlines the appalling case of the chagos islanders, who, it shows, between 1969 and 1971, were forcibly deported en masse from their homeland through the collusion of the british and american governments. anglo-american policy makers chose to so act due to their perception that the islands would be strategically vital bases for controlling the indian ocean through the projection of aerial and naval power. at a time during the cold war when most newly independent post-colonial states were moving away from the western orbit, it seems british and american officials rather felt that allowing the islanders to decide the fate of the islands was not a viable option. instead they chose to effect the wholesale forcible removal of the native population. the film shows that no provision was made for the islanders at the point of their ejection, and that from the dockside in mauritius where they were left, the displaced chagossian community fell into three decades of privation, and in these new circumstances, beset by homesickness, they suffered substantially accelerated rates of death.  following the passage of more than three decades, however, in recent months (and years), following the release of many utterly damning papers from britain's public record office (one rather suspects that there was some mistake, and these papers were not supposed to have ever been made public), resultant legal appeals by the chagossian community in exile have seen british courts consistently find in favour of the islanders and against the british state. as such, the astonishing and troubling conclusions drawn out in the film can only reasonably be seen as proved. nevertheless, the governments of great britain and the united states have thus far made no commitment to return the islands to what the courts have definitively concluded are the rightful inhabitants. this is a very worthwhile film for anyone to see, but it is an important one for britons and americans to watch. to be silent in the face of these facts is to be complicit in a thoroughly ugly crime.",1
"this movie is like the thousand ""cat and mouse"" movies that preceded it. (the following may look like a spoiler, but it really just describes a large class of movies) there is the passionate, wise main character, his goofy but well-meaning sidekick with his ill-placed attempts at humorous comments, the initially-hostile but soon softened gorgeous lady who triggers the inevitable ""unlikely"" love story, the loved ones taken hostage, and of course the careless evil adversary with his brutal minions. everybody has seen tons of these movies already, and ""national treasure"" is like any one of them, with only a slightly modified wrapping. every turn of the story was easily predicted (and i can assure you i am not the sharpest tool in the shed). i am quite tired of feeling tricked for money after exiting the theater from a hollywood movie, and if you have ever felt that way too, heed my warning; stay miles away from this movie.",0

"i really don't have anything new to add but i just felt like i had to comment on this sack. so here goes:  atrocious. i'm running through my mst3k dvd collection again and i just watched hobgoblins for about the 10th time. it's really, really painful but it was next on the list... you can see that there is a tiny kernel of an actual movie buried under all the crap that is ""hobgoblins"" but it just couldn't get out. everything about this movie is 4th rate. the story, the acting, the effects, the women, the ""action scenes"", the... ahhhh forget it. i can watch a piece of crap like ""the bloodwaters of dr. z"" (aka ""zaat"") over and over and over with hardly any ill effects (i like it in fact- btw, it will be on tcm later this month- october, 2009) but ""hobgoblins"" is a whole 'nother ballgame.  the worst part of it all may be that it's now about 12 hours after the movie ended, i had a good night's sleep, some coffee and some dry toast, my medications, and yet the ersatz ""new wave"" dance music that amy, red shorts, and laraine newman were frolicking to in the living room is still running through my head. this torment will last for days.   good luck, won't you?",0
"a memorable line from a short lived show. after viewing the episode where that line was introduced my fraternity intramural flag football team started using the line to break our huddles on offense. instead of ready / break, our quarter back said football and the rest of the squad responded you bet! a fun way to break the huddle that had our opponents scratching their heads as very few of them had watched the show. using this line added a unique element to our season that i'll never forget. we had our best season during my time in college that year and in a small way it was due to the fun that we had using this line. the show was pretty much a stinker but it lives on in the memories of the 1977 pi kappa phi intramural flag football squad at west virginia tech.",0
"dead to rights is about a police officer named jack slate who finds his murdered father and goes after the man that he thinks killed him.jack is later shot and framed for the murder of the man he suspected of killing his father.  several months later on the day jack is going to be executed he escapes from prison and searches the city for the man who framed him for murder.jack's search leads him through a trail of *beep* that doesn't end until everyone is dead.  through out the game jack uses weapons from m4 carbines to his dog shadow to kill endless streams of people in 15 levels.the game play is basically ""kill 30 people,find switch to open door.kill 50 people,find switch to open door"" over and over until the level is done.there are fun mini games too like playing as a stripper to distract bouncers at a night club so jack can get to another area in the club,or bomb disarming.  dead to rights is also a hard game.you will be put in an area swarming with bad guys armed with sub machine guns while you only have a pistol.near the end of the game skill turns to dust and you have to rely on luck.  dead to rights is as gory as it is hard.if you shoot a guy in the face with a shot gun blood will splatter on the walls,ceiling and floor.and since there are several guys in each area the walls will be painted in blood.  family fun for everyone.",1
"before tuscan sky, i saw diane lane's tender performance in this otherwise lark of a movie. campers are invited to the camp of their youth and experience it as adults. each of those that return seem to be looking for something they lost, which makes it so realistic. maybe you had to be a camper to really get it, but in the words of one character noticing all her clothes were wet ""this is so camp!"" from the practical jokes and fighting over boyfriends, to the scary lunch lady and the early morning bell ... it's amp. once exciting activities now seem mundane. a terrific ensemble cast makes the best of one-two dimensional roles and makes them believable. bill paxton, diane, elizabeth, mrs. brad paisley (probably when he first fell for her!!) the beautiful scenery, bright colors, comical music (including variations of hello muddah)and a comic acting turn by noted director sam raimi makes this a movie you can pull out again and again like looking up an old friend.",1

"the music and laurence olivier's sombre delivery set the tone perfectly for this outstanding documentary. this is still a must see for ww ii buffs, descendants of the participants of that conflict, politicians who think things always go their way when they extend their foreign policy via the deck of an aircraft carrier (did you hear that george bush?) and anyone else curious or needing to know the whys whos and hows of some aspect of that conflict. the 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order but can be seen out of sequence since they are more or less self contained. there is bound to be new insight for the new viewer because of the sheer volume presented. actual footage of the battles is interspersed with interviews of those involved in the stories. many of the interviews are with second line authorities, that is, support personnel to the main characters, privates, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses and the like. you get a real upfront taste of what war is all about.  i am presently watching the dvd version of the original television documentary. i strongly recommend this over the worn out, gaptoothed, overpriced vhs offerings available on ebay. i paid $120 cdn for five 2-sided dvd discs. this new release includes bonus material and is in full screen mode. the menus are easy to follow, there is first a choice of which episode you want to view and then after selecting that you are given the option of various chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode. it is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation there is a tiny amount more of navigation in the menu but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years, nay, after 60 years since the war finished.  i remember watching the first broadcast on the buffalo pbs station just before moving from london in 1975 and wishing right from that time that i could have a copy. now my wish has finally come true.  see this documentary. tell your friends. buy a copy for your library. remember and honour the sacrifices and challenges overcome by those from america, russia, britain, canada and all the other nations and peoples involved in the final victory. what an eye opener.",1

"seriously, i can easily stomach a lot of on screen blood, gore and repulsiveness, but what really makes this film disturbing & uncomfortable to watch is how the doctor character keeps on rambling about the physical damage done to raped women. he, john cassavetes of ""rosemary's baby"", talks about ruptured uterus, dry intercourse and massive loads of reddish (?) sperm like they are the most common little ailments in the world of medicine. that being said, ""incubus"" is an ultimately strange horror effort. it isn't necessarily awful  although it isn't very good, neither  but just plain weird. the muddled & incoherent script initially revolves on the hunt for a rapist-killer of flesh and blood (even though the title clearly suggests the involvement of a supernatural creature) and it never seems to stop introducing new characters. none of these characters, especially not the main ones, come across as sympathetic and for some never-explained reason they all seem to keep dark secrets. the aforementioned doctor has an odd interpretation of daughter-love and continuously behaves like he's a suspect himself, the town's sheriff (john ireland) appears to be in a constant state of drunkenness and doesn't even seem to care about who keeps raping & killing the women in his district, the female reporter is even too weird for words and the galens (an old witch and her grandson) are just plain spooky. all together they desperately try to solve the mystery of whom or what exactly is destroying the towns' women reproducing organs. the sequences building up towards the rapes & murders are admirably atmospheric and the vile acts themselves are bloody and unsettling. basically these are very positive factors in a horror film, but the narrative structure is too incoherent and the characters are too unsympathetic for ""incubus"" to be a really good film. also, there are quite a few tedious parts to struggle yourself through (like footage of a bruce dickinson concert!) and the usually very reliable john hough's direction is nearly unnoticeable. the final shot is effectively nightmarish, though. for me personally, ""incubus"" was a bit of a disappointment, but there are still several enough reasons to recommend this odd piece of early 80's horror to open-minded genre fanatics.",0

"given that a lot of horror films are based on the premise that one or more of the central characters does something stupid at some stage during the proceedings, the girls in this film would be collecting gold, silver and bronze at a darwin awards olympic ceremony. a mentally disabled baboon would have made better choices than they did, and would have screamed a lot less while doing so.  if you like films with a grainy picture, deliberately amateur camera-work (my 92 year-old grandmother wields a camcorder with better results), extremely poor sound and no discernible plot/narrative, then this is your ideal film. also note that you should enjoy the following: women screaming for no reason, women whining for no reason. in fact reason and logic don't appear much in this film. for example: ""we have to find stephanie"" ""yeah i can't believe i was speaking to her, like, last night"" ""she called you last night?"" ""yeah, she wanted to talk about some date she got asked one"" ""what? how come she didn't tell me""? as in, our friend is being chased by a serial killer with a shotgun and an array of grisly weapons but i have a problem with the fact that she didn't tell me she was going on a date.  okay, so the budget is low. that doesn't mean you have to make it look like it cost half the budget. the 'score' is interesting since all - with the exception of one - tracks have been written and performed by the writers/directors of the film itself. in fact it would appear that the entire budget has been blown on sampling a track by the duskfall, a death metal band from sweden.  the most worrying thing of all in the entire film is the ending which leaves us with the possibility for a sequel.",0
"i really, really wanted to like julian po. i think that slater is underrated as an actor, and that many of the supporting players here are better than they are given a chance to demonstrate in this film. i realize this is based on a short story which i have not read. so, i do not know if what i see as the film's faults originated with the story, or were imposed on it by the director/screenwriter. the premise is wonderful, and i loved the voiceover, confessional tone the opening narration strikes. but then...? nothing! several of the cliched local characters ask julian pointblank to explain his intention to commit suicide. one could argue that he doesn't answer, because it's none of their business. but julian is the one who, under only token pressure, blurted out his intentions in public. then neither julian nor the director/writer, despite the fact that the julian character is keeping a tape recorded journal for god's sake, seem inclined to provide anything beyond the scant initial information on julian's life. he says he was a bookkeeper. he says his family moved around when he was a child, due to his father's job. so what? there are several interactions with the locals which seem designed to illuminate julian's purpose. but none of them go anywhere, because julian seems to regard all these dopey locals as if they were aliens from another planet, as if he were the ultimate (and only) sane one among them. this might work as an allegory, if julian po had any defining characteristics or anything approaching wisdom to impart. the closest he comes to revealing anything about himself is in the scene in which he purposely humiliates the naive, religious wife of the mechanic. and what this scene reveals is not anything that would inspire empathy for julian. i can only see the julian character --as rendered--as selfish, petty, and totally condescending. sort of matches the attitude of the director of this half-baked, contrived film. and poor michael parks, an actor who once had so much promise, is given nothing to work with here.",0
"melissa's sixteenth birthday is right around the corner and she's just discovering her sexuality with boys. but it turns out that all the guys that she spends time with all wind up murdered in this generic '80's slasher film. it's up to the local town sheriff dan burke (bo hopkins, the wild bunch) and his annoying mystery-loving goody two-shoes daughter, marci (dana kimmell, friday the 13th part 3), to get to the bottom of these killings.  this film focuses more on the mystery and melodrama aspects of the movie and less on the killings themselves and thus is able to differentiate itself from a lot of it's '80's slasher brethren. it doesn't hurt that alesia has a great body (i feel the need to stress the obvious with stating that the actress is over 18 and thus convey that i'm not overly perverted). on the downside, the movie is hampered with a few plot points that are underdeveloped and unnecessary, a grating theme some that is used a bit too often, and an ending that is a tad anti-climatic. but the good outweigh the bad (barely). give this a rent, but i wouldn't buy it.  eye candy: aleisa shirley shows her tits, bush and ass   my grade: c   code red dvd extras: an intro by star aleisa shirley and director of intruder, scott spiegel; both director's cut & theatrical version of the film; audio conversation with star shirley and director jim sotos; interview with shirley, sotos & bo hopkins; still gallery; theatrical trailer for this film; and trailers for nightmare, stunt rock, rituals, & balalaika conspiracy",0

"*spoilers* some people claim that natural born killers is brilliant criticism of the media obsession with violence. but this contention ignores the actual content of the film. oliver stone could have shown his serial killers as vicious, inhuman murderers of innocent people and contrasted this with a morbid media fascination. instead he lends them justification. the movie portrays just about every victim as someone who deserved to be hurt. engaging in vicious stereotyping, stone presents the victims as unpleasant caricatures - dumb rednecks, broken-english speaking immigrants, lazy fat people. the one person that the homicidal lovebirds is also a stereotype. of course they befriend the old, hallucinogen-using american-indian - because they're trendy, dude? let's make him an admirable character. fat, chinese clerks and ""hicks"" are uncool, so let's make it seem like the deserve to die. instead of twisted,hateful that are corrupted by their misdeeds, their rampage makes them happier and more in love. mickey and mallory are made sexy and cool and surreal visuals are bound to entice more impressionable people. justice is mocked. the police and prison officials are portrayed as brutal, ugly and scowling compared to the gq murderers. again, this is not in the media reports within the film but in the ""reality"" in the film. there is no nuance or subtlety in the film - just overblown performances and visuals. the film says nothing new or specific about the obsession with violence. the proof that the film fails in its message lies in actual real world reactions to it. some impressionable young people who saw this movie cited it as inspiration for murders that they committed. the film's ""message"" is a failure because it inspires people in the opposite direction with horrendous real-life results. the clever message is nowhere to be seen.",0

"coming shortly before the imposition of a morality code darkened the spirits of writers, directors and actors, the first film adaptation of w. somerset maugham's ""of human bondage"" titillated countless moviegoers. it has no shock value today, just fine acting.  while the cast is excellent, this is bette davis's first great role and one of leslie howard's best performances. howard is english wannabe parisian artist philip carey who is gently and firmly told that he lacks any talent and that his dedication is no substitute for true genius. taking the lesson to heart he returns to london and enrolls in a medical college (one, by the way, that seems to have no female students-at that time there would have been at least a few. perhaps author/physician maugham didn't care for distaff medicos).  having tea one day carey is entranced by a waitress, mildred rogers, bette davis in a role as a morally loose and basically wicked farrago. her cockney accent is as sharp as eliza doolittle's. his repeated attempts to date her are greeted with the less than enthusiastic reply, ""i don't mind,"" a sure sign for any man with his head screwed on straight that he's plumbing the depths. maugham's mildred supplemented her waitress tips with a bit of old fashioned street-walking, something not clearly brought out here.  carey's besotted prostration serves rogers' avaricious need for support of the financial kind. he is desperately in love with her-she plays him as a sunday church organist effortlessly plies her instrument. no sex here. recognizing that he is getting nowhere, he begins a chaste relationship with norah, a woman who adores him. re-enter mildred, replete with a baby, and in her usual need of being taken care of. exit heartbroken norah.   another separation from mildred and carey begins a long-term friendship with sally, abetted enthusiastically by her dad who seems to view eventual marriage as both a good thing for the two young people and a chance to be relieved of one of his nine offspring.  the movie reasonably but not entirely follows maugham's excellent novel. howard's carey is naive and vulnerable and for much of the movie his sad eyes remind one of a doe facing a double-barreled shotgun. mildred is unrestrainedly wicked, a user of the worst kind, her sole preoccupation with her own needs barely disguised when she tries to wheedle carey with a thin patina of affectionate words (and offers-at one point she promises she'll do ""anything [he] wants,"" a daring statement for the times and one i'm sure audiences fully understood.  pre-code it may be but mildred's quick-march dissolution would have satisfied the league of catholic decency. the ending is conventional-sin loses, principled behavior triumphs.  director john cromwell wrought excellent performances from his two main stars, one well-established, the other established largely because of this film. the atmosphere is 1930s london and the trip back in time is worth taking.  available on dvd.  9/10 (for davis's and howard's performances)",1

"this movie was on british tv last night, and is wonderful! strong women, great music (most of the time) and just makes you think. we do have stereotypes of what older people ""ought"" to do, and there are fantastic cameos of the ""sensible but worried children"". getting near to my best movie ever !",1
"i think the reason for all the opinionated diarrhea on this movie is that most people have it out for sharon stone being around 50 and getting naked while playing sexy. no one cared when the golden girls sat around eating cheesecake and discussing their first orgasm, but to see someone post menopausal getting digitally pleased while driving i guess is just too much for some to handle. let's face it, she looks good, she's light years hotter than my mother who's the same age! it's not an oscar or a cult classic like the first, but ever since the turn of the century that's all movie goers seem to expect: a cinematic experience that will touch your soul. as such, it never claims to be either. it's an erotic thriller that is both erotic and thrilling, and is a continuation of a brilliant character that we all love to hate. it's the character of catherine trammell that helped give way for this sequel. fans of the first movie want to see more of that frosty ice queen.  the cinematography and art direction were lush and extravagant and made me want to move to britian for sure. the score is amazing as well.  sure there's some overacting from some characters but there's some brilliant work from david morrissey who's virtually unknown.  there's a setback in that the script is virtually the same as the first movie only plugging in a psychiatrist in place of the cop. as well as the criminal decision of the mpaa to force the movie to be cut down even more which takes away from the guilty-pleasure raunchiness that the story is known for.  at the very least it's entertaining and fun to look at it, and that's the movie's only intentions. so if you've got beef with mizz stone, maybe you should actually see the movie and draw your own conclusions before you spew forth your projectile vomit?",1
"it's a strange feeling to sit alone in a theater occupied by parents and their rollicking kids. i felt like instead of a movie ticket, i should have been given a nambla membership.  based upon thomas rockwell's respected book, how to eat fried worms starts like any children's story: moving to a new town. the new kid, fifth grader billy forrester was once popular, but has to start anew. making friends is never easy, especially when the only prospect is poindexter adam. or erica, who at 4 1/2 feet, is a giant.  further complicating things is joe the bully. his freckled face and sleeveless shirts are daunting. he antagonizes kids with the death ring: a crackerjack ring that is rumored to kill you if you're punched with it. but not immediately. no, the death ring unleashes a poison that kills you in the eight grade.  joe and his axis of evil welcome billy by smuggling a handful of slimy worms into his thermos. once discovered, billy plays it cool, swearing that he eats worms all the time. then he throws them at joe's face. ewww! to win them over, billy reluctantly bets that he can eat 10 worms. fried, boiled, marinated in hot sauce, squashed and spread on a peanut butter sandwich. each meal is dubbed an exotic name like the ""radioactive slime delight,"" in which the kids finally live out their dream of microwaving a living organism.  if you've ever met me, you'll know that i have an uncontrollably hearty laugh. i felt like a creep erupting at a toddler whining that his ""dilly dick"" hurts. but fried worms is wonderfully disgusting. like a g-rated farrelly brothers film, it is both vomitous and delightful.  writer/director bob dolman is also a savvy storyteller. to raise the stakes the worms must be consumed by 7 pm. in addition billy holds a dark secret: he has an ultra-sensitive stomach.  dolman also has a keen sense of perspective. with such accuracy, he draws on children's insecurities and tendency to exaggerate mundane dilemmas.  if you were to hyperbolize this movie the way kids do their quandaries, you will see that it is essentially about war. freedom-fighter and freedom-hater use pubescent boys as pawns in proxy wars, only to learn a valuable lesson in unity. international leaders can learn a thing or two about global peacekeeping from fried worms.  at the end of the film, i was comforted when two chaperoning mothers behind me, looked at each other with befuddlement and agreed, ""that was a great movie."" great, now i won't have to register myself in any lawful databases.",1
"another great movie by costa-gavras. it's a great presentation of the situation is latin america and the us involvement in latin american politics. the facts might or might not be accurate but it is a fact that the us was deeply involved in coups and support of latin american dictatorships.  despite this though the spirit of the movie follows the typical leftist/communist propaganda of the cold war era. costa-gavras is a well-known communist sympathizer and his movies are always biased. for example he presents the us actions as brutal and inhumane, while representing tupamaros' extremist activities as something positive.  as it turned out it was a blessing for uruguay and the rest of the latin america that the us got involved. europe is filled with poor east european prostitutes. i never heard of poor uruguayan or chilean girls prostituting themselves en masse as it happens in most east european countries. the us was fighting a dirty war and god bless us all the monster of soviet communism was defeated. it is unfortunate the us had to do what it did in latin america (and elsewhere) but sometimes you need to play dirty. this is not an idealistic world as costa-gavras and matamoros like to believe. had matamoros come to power in uruguay, we would've had another ukraine in latin america.  all in all this movie follows corrupt and bankrupt leftist ideology of times past and tries to pass it as idealistic and morally correct.",0
"as a fan of eric rohmer's studies of the contemporary war between the sexes, i was very eager to see ""the lady and the duke (l'anglaise et le duc)"" for how he would treat men and women during a real war, the french revolution.   the film looks beautiful, with each scene designed as a period painting, like a tableaux vivant. and i expected much talking, as that's rohmer's style. but maybe rohmer was restrained by basing the screenplay on a real woman's writings is why this mostly felt like a docudrama version of ""the scarlet pimpernel.""  as awful as the excesses of robespierre et al, how about some recognition that the french aristocrats were spoiled brats? i kept humming to myself: ""marat, we're poor/and the poor stay poor;"" you could also pick a tune from ""les miz.""  i wasn't all that sympathetic as the central figure has to go back and forth between her city home and country manor to stay ahead of the revolution. at one point her maid claims the pantry is bare but sure manages to lay out a fine repast. i simply didn't understand her, an english sympathizer who alternately rejects and defends her former lover and patron as he and the revolution keep shifting political focus; i think i was supposed to sympathize with her consistency more than their political machinations, like a character out of ""the scarlet pimpernel."" hey, the only reason she didn't go back home was her disgrace after an affair and child with the prince of wales or somebody.   usually in a revolutionary period there's some groundswell of change going on in relations between men and women, but i saw none here. i once went to a herbert marcuse lecture that concluded with a lengthy q & a; the last question, from an audience member far older than the rest of us acolytes, heck she had gray hair, was ""why are revolutionaries so grim?"" she was hooted at and marcuse didn't deign to respond to it seriously -- but it's the only thing of substance i remember from the whole evening. rohmer demonstrates that counter-revolutionaries are also grim and didactic.

"amazing. that's what you'd say if you sat through this film. simply, incredibly, amazing. it's actually so amazing that anyone was stupid enough to dump money into making this monstrosity that you simply can't believe what you're seeing. that, my friends, is what is truly scary about this film. somebody thought it was a good idea to make it.   well, here's another amazingly original story: high school student (occasionally seemed like collegego figure) has whore for a mom, lives in a trailer park, and is an ""artist"" who is ridiculed for his ""being all different."" well, of course, this poor ridiculed boy is eventually killed and, here's the original part, his soul inhabits a scarecrow (beneath which, he is killed by his slutty mama's latest john). then he goes around with the standard killing off of all the people that done hurt him. awww.  here's the breakdown:  the good:  --amazingly funny movieeven if that's not what the clearly drunk filmmakers wanted.  --this and the sequel on one disk in the wal-mart $5.00 binso it's only a little overpriced.  didn't hurt it, didn't help:  --the violence and gore are kind of sub-standard. one person is stabbed with a corncob.  --sounds like they put some effort into the musicbut it doesn't really fit the movieand isn't all that good.  the bad:  --terrible, terrible acting.  --another slasher let-down with sexy womennone of them removing clothing. when did that cease being a staple of low-brow slashers??  --ridiculous story.  --the scarecrow vomits up one-liners that would make freddy krueger and arnold swartzenegger blush.  --standard underlying love story goes nowhere, and is poorly done.  --some of the people killed seem like they were chosen at randomyou never really know who anybody is and then they're killed. and you only assume that they must've had it coming.  the ugly:  --extremely average slasher fare, just with a murdering scarecrow instead of well, all that other crap.  --nowhere near as interesting as freddy krueger, jason voorhees, pinhead, chucky, or even angela from the ""sleepaway camp"" seriesall of which are better than this atrocity.  --the absolute worst dialogue i have ever heard in my life. the script is laden with a level of retardedness that i never imagined could exist. i'm serious hereit's a full step beyond terrible. don't get me wrong, though, it's funny as hellbut i've never heard more asinine bantereven in ""slumber party massacre iii."" this film makes ""jason x"" look like shakespeare.  --the man who kills the boy that becomes the scarecrow: worst wig ever. dialogue to match.  memorable scene:  --the one where elementary-school youths spew out their own witty dialogue: ""hey, let's go find small animals to torture. huh huh.""  acting: 3/10 story: 3/10 atmosphere: 2/10 cinematography: 1/10 character development: 2/10 special effects/make-up: 5/10 nudity/sexuality: 1/10 (no nudity, mom's a whore, girls wear no bras) violence/gore: 5/10 (low quality, mediocre amount) dialogue: 0/10 (extremely ridiculous, blatant, over-the-top and painfully funnyso bad it's good. my first rating for dialogue in any film!) music: 5/10 direction: 2/10  cheesiness: 10/10 crappiness: 9/10  overall: 3/10  another one for just people like me who enjoy watching pure crap. or slasher-film completists. this is not a good movie, at all. laughable dialogue and characters keep it from being truly boring.  www.residenthazard.com",0
"i usually like zombie movies, but this one was just plain bad.  the good parts: girl swimming topless with thong bottoms, sonya salomaa's topless, and ona grauer's boobs jiggling in a skimpy top when she ran.  the bad part: too much video cuts, too much matrix slow motion (it drags the action), not enough blood and guts, bad acting, and no story. the only other person in the theater was smart and left right after the topless swimming scene. a total waste of $6 and time. i give it a 2 out of 10.",0
"first be warned that i saw this movie on tv and with dubbed english - which may have entirely spoiled the atmosphere. however, i'll rate what i saw and hope that will steer people away from that version. i found this movie excruciatingly dull. all the movie's atmosphere is lost with dubbing leaving the slow frustration of a stalker movie. i'm sorry, but the worst movie sin in my book is to be slow except when the movie about philosophy. i didn't see any deep philosophical meaning in this movie. maybe i missed something, but i have to tell it like i see it. i rated it a ""1"". what can i say, u.s. oriented tastes, maybe.",0

"who wrote this? some guy named john cohen. i guess this was the first screenplay he's ever worked on. someone should've told him you're supposed to write dialog that sounds like something someone actually might say.  and who directed this? scott marshal? son of gerry marshall. my the nut has fallen far from the tree. someone might have wanted to let him know that you can, in fact, shoot a scene in a cab in new york, and it will look real, and you won't have to fake it with a blue screen for no reason. might have also wanted to let him know he should stay away from jessica simpson, but hopefully he's learned that lesson now.  and jessica simpson... naturally she can't act. hell, she makes jessica alba look like audry hepburn, and yet she's starring in this movie. oh wait, it was produced by her father. okay, that's why she got the part. that's really the only reason i can think of.  so should i be surprised it's bad? no. should i be amazed at how bad it is? i think a lot of people would if they saw as much of it as i did. i mean you expect a movie starring jessica simpson to be bad, but this... it's not just bad, it's the complete opposite of a classic film. think of a great woody allen movie, this film is as bad as that film is good. it's the anti-annie hall.  i am so glad i didn't pay to see it, i stopped watching ten minutes in cus i couldn't go on. no doubt i would've walked out of the theater sooner. in fact i wonder how many of the 6 people who saw it per theater actually stayed and watched the whole thing. the film starts out laughably bad, and then goes to the point of being so bad it becomes a kind of chinese water torture. and then, around when the first act is ending, you realize it'll only get worse, and that's when you either need to leave, or kill yourself.  in conclusion, this film goes under the category of being so bad it should be used in place of water boarding at guantanamo bay. although some prefer the water boarding.",0
"please note: i see from the various posts that there was an original silent version and also a sound version of this same film. i saw the sound version and it was esthetically yicky. considering some indicate that the original version was longer and without crappy dubbing, my review must be read with this in mind.  although i know that rene clair has a lovely reputation as a film maker and louise brooks has a bit of a cult following as well, this is in many ways a technically poorly made film. while hollywood had already pretty much switched to sound mode around 1929, up through the early to almost the mid-30s, a lot of famous french films were essentially silent films--with some dialog and sound effects very poorly slapped over top the film. the lip movements in many, and in particular this film, don't even come close to matching what is being said and this would explain why an american like ms. brooks could do a french film. this is just sloppy and i would have preferred they had just made a silent film--and as a silent film this is would have been an average film--with excellent camera work (at times) and some decent silent-style acting.  the problem i also found with the film was the overly simplistic plot. for a silent morality play circa 1920, it would have been fine, but by 1930 standards the plot is a bit hoary (that means ""old""--not ""slutty""). a lady wins a beauty contest and her macho fiancé can't handle it. she gives it all up, temporarily, but is lured back to the fancy life and this spells her end! a tad melodramatic, huh? and also a bit simplistic and underdeveloped.  finally, the character of the fiancé's friend(?) i found very disturbing and unreal. he looked like harold lloyd and spent much of the movie being abused and picked on by the friend and everyone else. as he just took it throughout the movie and no resolution came about, his character seemed superfluous and the treatment he received mean-spirited. were audiences supposed to laugh as he was abused? this seems to me that's what is implied and i don't like it at all.  there are far better french films of the era (le million, la femme du boulanger, fanny, regain, and others) as well as better silent films. i just can't understand this film's high rating.",0
"i think a round of applause is in order for whoever pieced together the trailer for rogue pictures' latest release, 'the return'. i myself, along with everyone else have been duped into believing it is in fact a horror film. on the contrary though, its actually a supernatural thriller. too bad it is not the least bit thrilling.  'the return' stars sarah michelle gellar as joanna mills, a young woman who has had personal problems since the age of eleven. it was at that age that she began having haunting visions depicting the murder of a woman whom she has never met. while in texas on a business trip, she is led by these visions to the murdered woman's hometown, la salle. there she comes face to face with another person who has frequently appeared in her visions. a man by the name of terry stahl, who is played by peter o'brien. joanna is now on a desperate search for answers. a search that could in the end result in her very own murder.  i really don't know where to begin here folks. which should i mention first? the atrocious acting, hideous directing, or the terribly bland story? no matter which one i choose my point behind each is the same: they simply suck. adam sussman's screenplay is downright moronic. its not interesting. its not compelling. its just plain unpleasant. i kept waiting for something to jumpstart the ""film"" (i've placed quotations around film because i don't believe 'the return' deserves to be called an actual film due to it's foulness.) and at least give it some slight chance of hope, but nothing ever happened. i was left out in an unbearable cold to freeze. not even stellar performances from the actors themselves could have saved this disaster. of course they probably knew this having read the script then agreeing to do the ""film"". i assume this is why the acting was so awful. at least that's what i'm choosing to believe. i really hope the cast doesn't pride themselves on their performances. they need immediate medical attention if they do.  now the directing was unmistakably bad, but i can't quite crucify asif kapadia entirely. (well i could, but i won't since i'm such a nice guy.) i look at 'the return' as a test for kapadia because for all of you that don't know, this is his first full-length feature ""film"". he's just getting his foot in the door and still learning. next time around, well if there is a next time, hopefully he will have improved vastly. the only thing he was able to accomplish here was almost completely duplicating the visual style of marcus nispel's 2003 re-make of 'the texas chainsaw massacre'. now that's nice the ""film"" was given that, but unfortunately he still won't be receiving any kudos from me for that. copying someone else's work isn't something i consider to be praise worthy. (even if it is from a film i very much enjoyed.)  i think jim sonzero's american re-make of 'pulse' will now have to fork over the title of worst film of the year to 'the return'. it beyond question is deserving of the title in almost every imaginable way. now i don't doubt this will make a small, and i mean very small, profit. no matter what though, it won't surpass or even parallel the fluke success of gellar's previous acting effort, 'the grudge'. on that note, there's one last thing i'd like to add. i can honestly say i had never been embarrassed to have been seen leaving a theater auditorium until seeing 'the return'. that is something i never wish to experience again, along with the ""film"" itself.",0
"although the plot was a bit sappy at times, and very rushed at the end, as if the director had run out of his alloted time and needed to hurry up and finish the story, overall it was pretty good for the made-for-backwoods-cable-tv genre.   however, the actress who played the babysitter, mariana klaveno, was very good! i hope to see more of her around in movie-land. the music was also well done, getting every possible chill out of the dah-duh-dah-duh (think ""jaws"") type music-based tension build-ups.  i don't think i'd want to watch ""while the children sleep"" again, but if i did, it would be to focus on the performance of the talented klaveno.",1
"this is a big step down after the surprisingly enjoyable original. this sequel isn't nearly as fun as part one, and it instead spends too much time on plot development. tim thomerson is still the best thing about this series, but his wisecracking is toned down in this entry. the performances are all adequate, but this time the script lets us down. the action is merely routine and the plot is only mildly interesting, so i need lots of silly laughs in order to stay entertained during a ""trancers"" movie. unfortunately, the laughs are few and far between, and so, this film is watchable at best.",0

"i'm all for the idea of a grand epic of the american revolutionary war. this ain't it. (and for that matter, neither was the emmerich/devlin/gibson the patriot. but i digress.)  i saw this film at a publicity screening at the old mgm studios (now sony) just before it came out. the audience had high expectations for this expensive period piece, written by veteran robert dillon, directed by the esteemed hugh hudson (of chariots of fire fame), and starring al pacino.  but it didn't take long for people to start squirming in their seats, whispering derisive comments about pacino's horribly misconceived accent -- he was supposed to be an american frontiersman of scottish ancestry(!) -- and that of nastassja kinski, who was supposed to be recently emigrated from england(!!). then the story started and it all went downhill fast.  motivations were muddled, dialogue was atrocious, events had no historical or political context. what there was of a plot lurched forward on absurd coincidence; by the second or third time that alleged lovers pacino and kinski stumbled into each other it had become a bad joke. donald sutherland gave an unhinged performance as a british officer/pederast. his accent was all over the map too. i guess there weren't any english actors available.  lots of people left. those who stayed tried to stifle giggles, then openly guffawed. i stuck it out -- i figured that at least the battle scenes might be good. i was wrong. inexplicably, hudson chose to film them with hand-held cameras, not even steadicam, the jerkiness giving a misplaced newsreel 'authenticity' which ruined the sense of scale.  there was a semi-famous tv reviewer in the audience a few rows ahead of me: (the late) gary franklin of channel 7 eyewitness news. i could tell he was peeved by the behavior of the rest of us. and sure enough, on his tv segment the next day he gave the film a '10' on his notorious 'franklin scale of 1 to 10', while remarking churlishly about the louts who'd disrupted the screening the night before, who clearly didn't know art when they saw it. what a buffoon.  after this disaster, pacino didn't star in another film for almost 4 years. hugh hudson's career never recovered. you can't say i didn't warn you.",0

"ye lou's film purple butterfly pits a secret organization (purple butterfly) against the japanese forces in war torn shanghai. ding hui (zhang ziyi) and her ex-lover hidehiko itami (toru nakamura) find themselves on opposite sides of the conflict after a chance meeting.  i agree with the reviewer from paris. the film substitutes a convoluted, semi-historical conflict for a plot, without giving the audience a single reason to care about the characters or their causes. the sudden time shifting doesn't help matters as it appears completely unwarranted and pointless. normally i don't mind dark movies, but the absence of light, the bone-jarringly shaky camera footage, and the generally bad film-making techniques really make this a tough film to watch and stay interested in. i also agree with the viewer from georgia that this film ""has a chaotic editing style and claustrophobic cinematography"", but i don't think that helps the movie. the backdrop to the film is one of the most potent events of the 20th century, and i don't believe you can do it any justice by editing it as if it were a michael bay film. the overly melodramatic moments don't add to its watchability.  the actors are all suitably melancholy. zhang ziyi once again shows that she has an exceptionally limited acting range as she spends the entire movie doing what she seems to do best in all her films, brooding and looking generally annoyed. however, at least she adds some variety to this role by chainsmoking and engaging in the worst love-making scene since michael biehn and linda hamilton in the terminator.  all in all, a very disappointing film, especially seeing as how it comes from the director of suzhou he. 2/10",0
"this production never really got off the ground for me. the plot is so cut up as to be disjointed and the production is so short that unless you've read the novel or seen a better adaptation (like the 1995 one with amanda root) you're going to be a bit lost since there's no time for character development.  i liked sally hawkins as anne, but the rest of the cast fell rather short of what they should have been. mrs. croft was far too old, as was anne's elder sister elizabeth. mary uttered everything in such throbbing accents that the general peevishness and selfishness of her character was lost. much better was sophie thompson's mary, whose selfishness and sense of ill-usage is so well established that by the time wentworth suggests anne stay with the injured louisa and mary objects that she, as louisa's sister in law, should stay instead, you can't imagine anyone less suited to do so. in this version, she might as well stay as she is insufficiently differentiated from anyone else in the production.  rupert penry-jones is nice to look at, but he made a much better st. john rivers (1995 jane eyre), probably because that character required less implied depth of feeling. i agree with the comments made earlier about the gig scene: seemed more like he was trying to get rid of anne than do her a favor. likewise the accident scene: it happens so fast and with so little context, you wonder what all the fuss is about. and moving the speech that wentworth overhears in the novel to the beginning of this production is a critical misstep that only contributes to the disjointed nature of the script.   my other problem with this version was the lighting. sometimes everything looked like a scene from the csi morgue -- very very blue. other times the lighting was so bad it was hard to make out the scene very well, like when anne visits her old school friend, mrs. smith (who, by the way, is supposed to be more or less paralyzed. having her run up to anne on the street to tell her of mr. elliot's awful character was such a violation that for a minute i couldn't think who she was -- i thought she was one of the musgrove girls. and she might as well have been. all the girls were pretty much interchangeable). and the running scene at the end...in an era where propriety was at a premium, it's hard to imagine gentle anne tearing all over bath like some demented hoyden. how silly can you get? it's too bad. sally hawkins had all the makings of a good anne elliot, but she was completely hamstrung by a poorly organized script and an over-truncated production.",0
"***spoiler*** do not read this, if you think about watching that movie, although it would be a waste of time. (by the way: the plot is so predictable that it does not make any difference if you read this or not anyway)  if you are wondering whether to see ""coyote ugly"" or not: don't! it's not worth either the money for the ticket or the vhs / dvd. a typical ""chick-feel-good-flick"", one could say. the plot itself is as shallow as it can be, a ridiculous and uncritical version of the american dream. the young good-looking girl from a small town becoming a big success in new york. the few desperate attempts of giving the movie any depth fail, such as the ""tragic"" accident of the father, the ""difficulties"" of violet's relationship with her boyfriend, and so on. mcnally (director) tries to arouse the audience's pity and sadness put does not have any chance to succeed in this attempt due to the bad script and the shallow acting. especially piper perabo completely fails in convincing one of ""jersey's"" fear of singing in front of an audience. the only good (and quite funny thing) about ""coyote ugly"" is john goodman, who represents the small ray of hope of this movie.  i was very astonished, that jerry bruckheimer produced this movie. first ""gone in 60 seconds"" and now this... what happened to great movies like ""the rock"" and ""con air""? that was true bruckheimer stuff.  if you are looking for a superficial movie with good looking women just to have a relaxed evening, you should better go and see ""charlie's angels"" (it's much more funny, entertaining and self-ironic) instead of this flick.  two thumbs down (3 out of 10).",0

"just saw this at the chicago film festival - avoid it at all costs unless you have sleep problems. it is a film filled with pretensions - it opens with a minor quote from ""hiroshima mon amour"" and it's all downhill from there. camera work - imagine a child trying to imitate wong kar wai. story line - smokey robinson and the miracles' ""the love i saw in you was just a mirage"" expanded from 3 minutes to over 2 hours but filled with repetition. for butt numbing pain this film ranks with the benches at the methodist church my parent dragged me to when i was a kid. i want 2+ hours of my life refunded. julian hernandez's promoter prefaced the viewing with comment that the film was ""controversial"" - that is true only for the film's narcotic effect.",0

"the russian movie, ""4,"" follows the lives of three (not four) strangers who meet one night in a local bar. one is a musician, one a frozen meat seller and one a call girl.  ""4,"" i gather, is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in post-soviet russia (the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are), but the movie is so incoherent and boring that i seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it. there seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes - operating secret cloning facilities, selling decades-old frozen meat etc. - but the movie is so formless and incomprehensible that i doubt anyone could figure out what anybody's really up to here.  despite decent acting and a few incisively directed scenes, ""4"" is a two-hour long endurance contest that should be avoided at all costs.",0
"another trashy grade z quickie from the prolific albert pyun. tim thomerson´s 13 inch clint eastwood-like cop from outer space chases an ugly flying head(!) to earth and gets involved in a gang war in south bronx! mercifully short, but deadeningly dull, with the cheesiest effects since attack of the 50ft woman. they should have fired the continuity guy, too: note how thomerson´s sunglasses disappears and reappears in every second shot. laughably bad, but that´s why we watch these movies, ain´t it? sequel ´dollman vs. demonic toys´ is reportedly even worse, if that´s possible.  0 (of ****)  ",0
"in an alternate 1950s, where an outbreak of the undead (caused by a mysterious 'space-dust') has been contained through the use of special electronic collars, a young loner, timmy, finds a friend in fido (billy connelly), his family's recently acquired domesticated zombie.  fido quickly becomes a surrogate father to timmy, whose real dad is unable to adequately express his love for his son (or for his hot-to-trot wife, played by the gorgeous carrie-anne moss) having been psychologically scarred as a child (when he was forced to shoot his own father, who tried to eat him!).  timmy runs into a spot of bother, however, when his putrid pal's collar goes on the blink, and he attacks and kills an elderly neighbour. with the authorities on fido's trail, trouble brewing with a pair of local bullies, and his mother forming a bond with their undead house-help, will timmy be able to hold on to his new found friend?  a refreshing take on the whole zombie schtick, fido is a thoroughly entertaining, deliciously dark comedy that should appeal to anyone with a slightly twisted sense of humour. taking the romero zombie-verse and transplanting it into 1950s small town america is a stroke of genius, and the result is simply one of the most original films to tackle the whole 'reanimated dead' theme that i have seen.  connelly's fido is a cinematic zombie worthy of inclusion in the undead movie hall of fame, along with day of the dead's bub, and return of the living dead's tarman; it is not often i feel empathy for a walking corpse, but the big yin's performance is so fine that i actually found myself rooting for the big blue bag of pus! the rest of the cast also give commendable performances, with young k'sun ray (as timmy) and ms.moss deserving special mentionsray, because, for one so young, he puts in a particularly assured turn, and moss because she is so bloody yummy!  this is the third zombie film that i have watched this week (the others being the somewhat disappointing planet terror and the rather fun flight of the living dead), and, to my surprise, it is also the best. director andrew currie has given fans of the genre something truly original to treasure and is a talent to be watched in the future.  8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for imdb.",1

"some people loved ""the aristocrats"" and others hated it, frequently walking out in the middle. reactions to eddie izzard aren't likely to be that extreme -- if you can handle a transvestite comedian (who says he likes girls) and has a vocabulary that makes, shall we say, enough use of the ""f"" word that his program would be one long beep if presented on network television. many of izzard's fans are so devoted that they see no flaws whatsoever in his performances. on the other hand, i thought this show was occasionally flatter than izzard's chest but also more often than not funny and, in spots, absolutely hilarious. he has a way of connecting references from routines early in the show to his later routines. he's not a story teller. he's not a joke maker. he's not a frenetic fantasist like robin williams. he plays around with ideas, some of which work and some of which -- a routine with the san francisco cable car and alcatraz, for instance -- are completely unfunny. he has a way, however, of moving gracefully past the flopped routines and extending the ones that connect. i gave this performance a 7 and might be persuaded to raise it to an 8. but a 10? no way.",1
"this might contain a spoiler, so beware.  if it had been 200,000 thousand or two million people, does it make a difference? sometimes i get so angry at the apparent apathy of a small number of (strangely very loud) americans, but i have to remember that many people here in the us were not bred or raised to care about anything outside of their comfort zone. god help us for what we have done. after the relative ease of what we did to the native americans, and the indifference to the horrors of enslaving a race, you would think we'd have grown hearts and souls in the late 60's and early 70's. but now i see it is ok as long as our ends are justified to only us. how then, can we look at any other dictator and horrible government and think we are somehow doing good to impose our will? we are contradictory and hypocritical, and i am ashamed for this. i feel sorrow for the people affected. they deserve justice and their homes back. if this was done in my name as an american for my supposed safety, i don't want it. i denounce these actions, and hope our global community understands that many americans believe the american government is a runaway train of deceit. no one is above the law. i want my country back, and so do the chagos islanders. regardless of what people post from the anonymity of their computers, no one can in their heart deny that they would be unwilling to give up their birthplace for some bombs and heliports. we can't stand to be stuck in traffic, let alone forcibly and unjustly removed from our homes.

"i'll give credit where credit is due, and say that linda fiorentino gives a good performance as a hard-drinking actress who does what she wants. she's brash, sassy, hard-edged, and very sexy; she is much better than this film deserves.  but that is it. this dull suspense film is a fragmented mess, attempting at once to be a stalker thriller, a murder thriller, a tale of loyalty and betrayal, and a steamy erotic thriller. the film, my friends, isn't thrilling in the slightest.  for instance, who thought of casting c. thomas howell as a desirable leading man? he is not ugly, but for crying out loud, it looks as though fiorentino's tough-cookie goddess is getting it on with a kindergarten teacher. howell has neither the authority or screen presence to fill the leading man role.  the script is by far the worst aspect of the film. there is no tension as fiorentino's character gets eerie phone calls, there is no mystery concerning her guilt in the murders that are the focus of the film, there is no sense of liberation as fiorentino gets wimpy howell to lose his inhibitions.  look for interesting but poorly-done cameos by adam ant and issac hayes, and one really, really good sex scene between howell and fiorentino. besides that, my first impulse would be to put this sorry piece of trash down and go rent something else.",0

"elvira, mistress of the dark (1988)  directed by: james signorelli  starring: cassandra peterson, w. morgan sheppard, daniel greene, and edie mcclurg  plot: elvira (cassandra peterson) quits her tv show and heads to the small christian town fallwell, massachusettes to collect on her dead aunt's inheritance, hoping to make big bucks to open up a show in vegas. unfortunately for her, all she gets is a creepy old house, a poodle, and a magic cookbook. while in fallwell, elvira tries to make money, breathe some life into the teenagers, win the heart of a stud (daniel greene), avoid being burned at the stake, and keep the cookbook from her creepy uncle (w. morgan sheppard), who is planning to use the book to end the world.  my thoughts: i love both cassandra peterson and her alter-ego elvira. she is a very successful, beautiful, and funny woman and as elvira she's all that plus morbid and hilariously naive, not to mention she has an amazing pair of knockers. in this movie, her charms are put to good use.  i loved the whole 'fish out of water' feel to the film. you got elvira, with her low-cut black dress, her big black hair, and her enormous 'twins', and she's in a christian town where most of the girls aren't even allowed to wear makeup. this also makes her love story with bob (daniel greene) a lot more entertaining.  w. morgan sheppard is equally great as elvira's uncle/nemesis vincent, out to steal the book to use it for evil. he has a lot of presence but still doesn't get in the way and steal scenes from elvira.  what really makes the film is not the plot, but the many jokes. everything from boob jokes to horror spoofing is here and makes me laugh a lot more than anything from a scary movie sequel. i hear there are about 56 boob jokes in this film, and any fan of roger corman b-horror flicks will love the spoofing in this film.  if you love elvira, you will love this flick. also check out elvira's haunted hills.",1

"recap: something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica. the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica. julian rome, a former seti-worker, is brought in to decipher the message. problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his, and the situation quickly turns awkward, especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him. and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly. soon the object is in the open. the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity. it is decided to open the object, but just before that is done, julian decodes the signal. ""do not open"". but too late, and the object explodes as it is finally breached, and two things unleashed on earth. the first is an alien, that had been dormant in the object, and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff. and washington, that is suspiciously updated on this historic event, decides that those things can not be unleashed upon the earth. so a russian nuclear submarine, carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica.  comments: the movie holds a few surprises. one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance, and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful, well worked through and a lot better than expected. unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own, and this time not in a good way. actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes. it is never really explained why washington know so much, why washington is able to command russian submarines, why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now. it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english. some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language (and obviously chose english, why?). but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus, send their ""do not open"" message encoded! and finally the end is as open as an end can be.  the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy (from me) must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot. therefore the total impression of the movie is not too good.  3/10",0
"howling ii (1985) was a complete 180 from the first film. whilst the first film was campy and creepy. the second one was sleazy and cheesy. the production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. the brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. the ""scene"" from the first film was badly re-created. a skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (reb brown) to the old country (romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. christopher lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. sybil danning and her two biggest assets appear as stirba, the head werewolf of the romania. she also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww!  bad movie. there's nothing good about this stinker. i'm surprise philippe mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker. the film is so dark that you need a flashlight to watch it (no, not the content but the film stock itself). to round the movie off you get a lousy ""punk"" performance from a damned wannabe ""babel"". maybe if they forked over a couple of extra bucks they could've got the real deal instead of an imitation.  best to avoid unless you're desperate or you lost the remote and you're too lazy to change the channel.",0
"i saw this film last night on cable and it is extraordinary. what i love most about it is that it is understated and low-key, but deeply heartfelt. henry thomas' (he played the child in e.t.) performance is masterfully inarticulate (he is supposed to be a man of few words). david straithern is a wonderful crazy villain. and miraculously (given that we're talking about a hollywood product here) a baby serves as a main character, but one who doesn't act or have lines, but rather just is (& is luminous at that). interesting to note that thomas' mysterious relationship w. e.t. was the core of that film; while his bond w. the baby serves as the core of ""a good baby.""  then there is the music--ah, what music!! gillian welch's tunes are wonderful & the entire score is gorgeous hill country music.  this film is wonderfully atmospheric. i recommend it highly.",1
"bravo! morgan freeman is an actor, who researches a character he is selected to play, before he makes a commitment. freeman is a 'good fit' for this film (like he was for ""driving miss daisy""), and he is not only believable, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety. although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyping. and it must be said that stereotyping has hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers.  this is a low-budget film that, amazingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. it is a film that is well directed and written by brad silberling. the location manager chose carson, ca for the film's setting, and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film. the editing is fair to good, but a little rough.  silberling was the 'subcontractor', in getting freeman to do this film, while the actor was in-between film projects.  there is a good chemistry between freeman and paz vega, a spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. the film also encourages an understanding between people, who not only speak two languages (english and spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, folkways, principles, and values. the film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film's integrity.  part of the comedy is that freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years. in truth, freeman is so-in-demand as an actor that he is constantly working.  the film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, changing, and exchanging. and, the film's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role.  if necessary, tell your boss that you're taking a 'mental health day', and go see this film. if you're able, take your significant other or your family with you. i rank the film a 10 out of 10. it's enjoyable, interesting, informative, poignant, and worthwhile.",1
"when ""girlfight"" came out, the reviews praised it, but i didn't get around to seeing it. i finally saw it when it got released on video, and understand the glowing reviews.  the movie opens in a high school in the middle of a ghetto. we quickly get introduced to student diana guzman (michelle rodriguez). she has a bad-ass expression on her face, and any idea about diana that we might derive from this expression soon gets corroborated when she gets in a fight. as diana gets in trouble for this, we then meet her father, an aggressive type in his own right; clearly we can't totally blame diana for her attitude.  but then the movie really picks up, as a new thought germinates in diana's mind: boxing as a way to escape this grim existence. her older brother has already gotten into boxing, but her father most likely won't approve. only diana herself can decide what to do.  just the first few minutes alone identified that i was in for a very gritty, non-hollywood movie, but the brief appearance of john sayles in a supporting role truly affirmed that. even before they get to any boxing scenes, you feel like you're getting pounded in the face at seeing the ugly life that diana lives. and when they finally arrive at the film's main story, there's no turning back.  all in all, i definitely recommend this movie. i will admit that using boxing as a means to show someone trying to make something of himself/herself has been sort of a cliché in cinema for many years (""rocky"", ""million dollar baby""), but i still think that they did a great job with it here. in fact, this may have brought the genre to its apex. really good. too bad that michelle rodriguez wasted herself in hollywood movies after this one.",1

"kevin spacey is very talented, but unfortunately directing is not his forte. i had high expectations about the film before i rented it and maybe that is why i disliked it so much. i admire spacey's attempt at making a film that takes place mostly in one small setting, but it's not the attempt that counts. i found the film dull, boring, and stretched out. the acting was nothing spectacular. gary sinise has done much better, especially since he is conscious in most of his other films. skeet ulrich was disappointing, but this was one of his first films (i did get a kick out of how young and chubby this scream star looked). the only thing that impressed me about this film was the one shot of the car wreck from above. the center line of the road was perfectly centered and the camera moved on along the line and past the wreck. however, that shot was very ""usual suspects""ish and my guess is spacey got the idea from that earlier film of his (which is very good mind you). if you want to see a fabulous film that takes place in one small setting, watch hitchcock's lifeboat. maybe spacey should have watched it before filming this.",0
"8 simple rules is a funny show but it also has some life lessons especially one mature lesson about moving on after a lose which was the episode where paul died which was the first episode i have ever watched of the show that comes on abc. the hennessy clan -- mother cate (katey sagal), daughters bridget (kaley cuoco) and kerry (amy davidson), and son rory (martin spanjers) -- look to one another for guidance and support after the death of paul (john ritter), the family patriarch. cate's parents (james garner and suzanne pleshette) lend a hand. i am glad later in the 2nd season of this show they decided to put david spade in this show since he was done with the nbc series, just shoot me! but all and all this show is pretty good. this show reminds me a lot of the classic family sitcoms from the 80's and 90's that used to be on abc.",1
"an unusual take on time travel: instead of traveling to earth's past, the main trio get stuck in the past history of another planet. they beam down to this planet, whose sun is scheduled to go nova in 3 or 4 hours (that's cutting it close!). in some kind of futuristic library, they meet mr. atoz (a to z, get it? ha-ha) and his duplicates. it turns out, instead of escaping their planet's destruction via space travel, the usual way, the inhabitants have all escaped into their planet's various past time eras. mr. atoz uses a time machine to send people on their way after they make a selection (check out the discs we see here, another trek prognostication of cds and dvds!). when mr. atoz prepares the machine (the atavachron-what-sis), gallant kirk hears a woman's scream and runs into the planet's version of earth's 17th century, where he gets into a sword fight and is arrested for witchery. there's an eccentric but good performance here by the actress playing a female of ill repute in this time, using phrasing of the time (""...you're a bully fine coo.. witch! witch! they'll burn ye...!""). spock & mccoy follow kirk, but end up in an ice age, 5000 years earlier.  kirk manages to get back to the library first. the real story here is spock's reversion to the barbaric tendencies of his ancestors, the warlike vulcans of 5000 years ago. this doesn't really make sense, except that maybe this time machine is responsible for the change (even so, spock & mccoy weren't 'prepared' by atoz - oh, well; it also seems to me spock was affected by the transition almost immediately - he mentions being from 'millions of light years' away, instead of the correct hundreds or thousands - a gross error for a logical vulcan). in any case, spock really shows his nasty side here - forget ""day of the dove"" and remember ""this side of paradise"" - mccoy quickly finds out that his vulcan buddy will not stand for any of his usual baiting and nearly gets his face rearranged. spock also gets it on with zarabeth, a comely female who had been exiled to this cold past as punishment (a couple of trek novels were written about spock's son, the result of this union). all these scenes are eye-openers, a reminder of just how much spock conceals or holds in. it's also ironic that, only a few episodes earlier (""requiem for methuselah""), mccoy was pointing out to spock how he would never know the pain of love - and now all this happens. kirk, meanwhile, tussles with the elderly atoz, who insists that kirk head back to some past era (""you are evidently a suicidal maniac"" - great stuff from actor wolfe, last seen in ""bread and circuses""). it all works out in the end, but, like i mentioned earlier, they cut it very close. a neat little trek adventure, with a definite cosmic slant.",1
"i, too, loved this series when i was a kid. in 1952 i was 5 and my family always watched this show. my favorite character was the one played by marion lorne as a rather stuttering, bumbling and very lovable ""aunt"" type person. i can still recall her ""ubba bubba um um"" type comments as she would try and say something important. and then when she came back and played aunt clara in bewitched it was great casting!   it was the first time that i can remember seeing walter matthau whose career i followed as a fan for many many years.  i have a question if anyone can verify: was the title or end credits music the ""swedish rhapsody"" by hugo alfven? every time i hear it played on my classical radio station here in southern california it brings back memories of the image of mr. peepers walking away with his back to the camera. i'm not even certain if this image in my mind's eye is correct.",1
"how many fricken' times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background & peaking through a mirror's reflection? it's been done in two dozen movies in recent memory & four dozen times in this choppy, poorly done film. there were only two freaky moments to appreciate....when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters. speaking of characters, the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz. cup i was drawing it from. the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons. there was the friendly, aged sheriff. there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl. lots'o'characters with no development. the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning. but rather than explore the child's murder, which would have been interesting, they just let us know that she was dead & her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community & each other. when they reach the cabin, the scenes rarely flowed together....with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here & there. oh...and the eerie sounds were also overdone. you know what i mean....creaking doors that open by themselves, crickets in the forest, yada yada yada. ooooohhhh. haven't seen that before. again, you'll see the amazing self-opening door in the movie over and over an over again. note to director: a scary scene is only scary if it's not repeated every 5 minutes in the same film. think these things out before calling out ""it's a wrap!""",0
"i did not intend to write this review, but having read the default review that shows up on this movie's url, i felt compelled to write a rebuttal. the movie in a word is superlative. it does not deserve the slanderous review that the writer has written. i think the writer has totally missed the point of the movie to a large extent. in fact, i too was turned off by the excessive show of evangelist devotions that occupied the middle of the movie to a large extent. however, i must beg to differ with the reviewer in that, this movie in the end is not a propaganda piece for evangelist action. i think, what the director has shown is that how religion is not enough to find all the answers, how religion is to a large extent incapable of providing answers to basic, simple questions that one may ask and all that religion has to offer is sometimes just banal platitudes of one kind or another. this does not demonstrate a value judgment on religion as we have to remember that religion is transmuted and expressed by ordinary, mostly well meaning, basically good people and they usually have no monopoly on truth and thus religion can not in the end provide the ultimate answers to some questions in life. ultimately, it is a matter of faith. you have to take it on faith and that's all. and if you are given to faith, then you can appreciate any show of faith. and if you are not given to faith then any show of faith is tiresome. it is thus at the same time, instructive to note the reviewer reaction to the movie. in any case, the director shows us that one can choose not to accept the religious interpretation of events and answers to questions and in spite of that life goes on and there are 'secret sunshine' in this world that awaits all wounded souls, regardless of their religious orientation. and that's just the core message of the film! please note the last scene of the movie, if you don't get this! in the end, the movie is a great one and very thought provoking and confronts you - the viewer with questions that you have to answer for yourself. thus it is a work of art that is challenging to you personally. i do agree with the reviewer in that, the evangelical stuff was a bit too much. however, given the above interpretation of religion as shown in the movie, i think the director was trying to balance the act whereby he might not be called an evangelist  basher! the actor kang-ho song was great as always. he's so balanced and just perfect that he's just amazing. he's my favorite korean actor no doubt. i know the actress do-yeon jeon got the cannes award for best actress for this movie. however, i did not find any specialty in her acting. it seems that to get awards you just have to act really convincingly in crying and hysterical scenes and all all in all a great movie. if you don't like it  please watch it again and see if you get it! if it leaves you dissatisfied or uncomfortable or asking questions then think, if that was not what the director was actually aiming at through this movie in the first place!",1
"""cosby,"" in my opinion, is a must-see cbs hit! i'm not sure if i've never seen every episode, but i still enjoyed it. it's hard to say which one is my favorite. also, i really loved the theme song. if you ask me, even though i liked everyone, it would have been nice if madeline kahn hadn't passed away during the show's run. since that happened, i've always wondered what the show would have been like. everyone always gave a good performance, the production design was spectacular, the costumes were well-designed, and the writing was always very strong. in conclusion, even though it can be seen on tbs now, i strongly recommend you catch it just in case it goes off the air for good",1
"as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser, i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but i am not a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester. the penchant for slapstick spoilt 'the three musketeers' for me and the same applies here. to me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. this is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. when i first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star oliver reed. i rejoiced, as reed to me was the epitome of flashman. how i would have loved to see him in the role. malcolm mcdowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck. what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet (tom bell). a great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell. possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'flash for freedom', adapted by mr fraser, worked quite well. perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen.",0
"journey to the center of the earth is the story of some tourists of hawaii, three of them siblings, and one of them a young british nanny babysitting a dog. when the siblings accidentally drive off in their jeep with the basket of dog biscuits, the nanny follows them (it might've just been safer to purchase more) all the way to the cave the siblings intended to explore (i guess). for some reason, they actually go in the cave and then, when the place starts caving in, they try to get out to no avail, except for the six-year-old sister who they tell to go get help. meanwhile, the more they move around in the cave, the more they continue to plummet further and further towards the earths cavernous core. and behold, it is here where they find the city of atlantis and its bizarre alien habitants who are living under the oppressive rule of one alien that doesn't want them asking to many questions about the worlds external to their own.  i see that rusty lemorande, the named director of the film has provided comments on this film, in which he explains that part of latter half of this film is actually the sequel to alien in l.a. well, whatever it was, it was an amazingly cheap movie that i would rank only slightly higher than city limits (a 1988 sci-fi film also made on a non-existent budget) because at the least ending of this dreadful piece of mostly incoherent film-making that cuts corners where it can aims for some humor and amusement in the last 20 minutes when we finally see what life is like in the alien world at the center of the earth. i also give it a two star rating rather than one because it was at times, funny, even if only in its subtleties. for example, the aliens asks the british girl if she's an alien and she explains that the ministry should be sending her work visa shortly. or when the alien girl finds bryan and explains that he is in the city of altantis and he mistakes this for atlantic city, new jersey. little things like that make the idiocy of the first hour or so tolerable. imagine how great the film could've been though if they had 1) actually intended to make it, and 2) actually had money to make it.  i do like how in the end, no one wonders what happened to the little sister who was sent away in the beginning to get help. she'd just be wandering around the hawaiian caves and not too far from the erupting volcano, mind you.",0
"trifling romantic drama directed by clint eastwood about the loving relationship which grows between a comely hippie (kay lenz) and a los angeles real estate agent in his golden years (william holden, surprisingly affable within this highly-concocted arrangement). the script is slight but not without some thoughtful passages; still, the scenario is such a middle-aged cliché by now that most of the picture comes off as puerile. it may have worked much better with different leads: holden and lenz don't match up well (her stature is so slight he seems to tower over her), making their intimate scenes less stirring than simply uncomfortable. dated, blurry-romantic, and mostly unmemorable. ** from ****",0
"the ""confidential"" part was meant to piggy-back on the popular appeal of the lurid magazine of the same name, while the labor racketeering theme tied in with headline congressional investigations of the day. however, despite the a-grade b-movie cast and some good script ideas, the movie plods along for some 73 minutes. it's a cheap-jack production all the way. what's needed to off-set the poor production values is some imagination, especially from uninspired director sidney salkow. a few daylight location shots, for example, would have helped relieve the succession of dreary studio sets. a stylish helmsman like anthony mann might have done something with the thick-ear material, but salkow treats it as just another pay-day exercise. too bad that brian keith's typical low-key style doesn't work here, coming across as merely wooden and lethargic, at the same time cult figure elisha cook jr. goes over the top as a wild-eyed drunk. clearly, salkow is no actor's director. but, you've got to hand it to that saucy little number beverly garland who treats her role with characteristic verve and dedication. too bad, she wasn't in charge. my advice-- skip it, unless you're into ridiculous bar-girls who do nothing else but knock back whiskeys in typical strait-jacketed 50's fashion.",0
"i have to admit, this movie moved me to the extent that i burst in tears. however, i always think about things twice, and instead of writing a eulogy that would define the film as flawless and impeccable, i prefer taking the risk of a closer look.  first what's first: the movie has an undeniable impact on the viewer simply because it starts out and continues as a slow-paced movie that doesn't try to blow you away with the actual scenes from 9/11. thumbs up for this stroke of genius, because, unlike stone's world trade center this film fortunately doesn't focus on the attack itself but on the fallout which, similar to the fallout of a nuclear explosion, is hardly visible but nonetheless dangerous and devastating. the psychological impact, the sheer devastation that 9/11 caused and the havoc it wreaked on the american people is almost palpable in this movie. i think binder managed an astute observation of the american post 9/11 society and sandler in my opinion sky rocketed from an average comedy actor to a real talent who delivers a performance worthy of an oscar.  however: in the film blood diamond, the di caprio character says and i quote: ""ah, these americans. always want to take about their feelings"". now, i don't want to belittle their sufferíngs, but i sure would like to make a comparison. ever since 9/11 the entire world is confronted with mementos, memorials and commemorations of 9/11. the hollywood industry and writers such as safran foer more than allude to 9/11 in their works. now, this huge amount of cultural products, dealing with 9/11, turn the death of 3000 people into the biggest tragedy of this young century. the number of books written on the subject and the number of films directed on this subject, and i say this with all due respect, blow the importance of this atrocious crime somewhat out of proportion.  fact is: people die every day due to unjust actions and horrible crimes committed by bad or simply lost people. we have a war in iraq, in afghanistan, in birma and lots of other countries. on a daily basis, we forget about the poverty the african people suffer from and we tend do empathize with them to a lesser degree than with the american victims of 9/11 simply because they are black and because their lives don't have much in common with our western lives. africa neither has the money nor the potential to commemorate their national tragedies in a way america can. so, what i am saying is this: the reason why we feel more for the 3000 victims of 9/11 and their families is because we are constantly reminded of 9/11. not a day goes by without a newspaper article, a film or a book that discusses 9/11.  in conclusion: i commiserated with charlie fineman, but i wasn't sure whether i had the right to feel for him more than for a hutu who lost his entire family in the rwandan civil war.  you catch my thrift?",1
"there is some spectacular, heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals, from arctic to tropical and everything in between. the camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work. editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too, with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world. where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes - seasonal patterns, climate change, individual animal stories and hunter/ hunted interactions across multiple environments. eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed. overall, well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but don't expect oscar material.",1
"30 seconds into the opening credits, i had this feeling that this was going to be a bad movie, but i didn't know just how bad. then the actor playing the evil nazi scientist opens his mouth and my friend and i decide that in order to survive this movie, we'll have to turn the volume down, make up our own dialogue and double the speed on the dvd. but that didn't help. about half way through we turned it off. now, i've lived through some very bad movies before, both with and without the aide of ""mystery science theater 3000"" and ""svengoolie,"" but there are just some movies which i doubt even the bots can save. the biggest part of the movie that bothered me the most was that the people hypnotized into believing they're zombies had rotting green skin. i guess they were all hypnotized into death, then hypnotized into rotting themselves. stick to the real b-movie cult classics like ""plan nine from outer space.""",0
"dick tracy is one of my all time favorite films. i must admit to those that haven't seen it. you will either really love it or really hate it. it came out a year after the success of batman. so everyone's expectations were so high that many were let down simply because the plot is so simple. but its based on a comic strip...what did you expect? creatively, this movie is amazing! the sets, make-up, music, costumes, and the impressive acting make this film fantastic. the film has bloodless violence and no bad language - that's something rare these days. directed, produced, and stars warren beatty as the ace crime fighter going up against al pacino's evil big boy caprice and his mob of thugs. madonna steals the show as the seductive breathless mahoney. this is one of the best characters madonna has ever played. she has the best one liners i've heard! madonna fans would love it! one of the coolest things about the film is that they only used seven colors to make it look like a comic strip. this film is truly a piece of artwork that is sadly overlooked by the public. to sum things up, this film brings out the child in all of us. it's a film that will leave you smiling at the end.",1
"let me start off by saying that this doesn't seem or feel like a movie. it seems like just another tv show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it up.  the camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it. this film takes us to where no movie i've seen has done before: to a realm where the film theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation. too obvious. the large movie screen is only used as an enlarged tv from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life manner.  lately it seems that young directors are compromising the art of film making for sales. this is very scary. the industry is spoiling the art in movies. we must educate ourselves and our children about what cinematography and its language are really about. not just sales and entertainment, but a way to communicate feelings, passions and even culture. not as a launching platform for young divas and jocks.",0
"never saw the original movie in the series...i only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980's as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified. this movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now. anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie. it was, however, a movie that would make some walt disney movies look dark. really, this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen. the only real sighting is near the end when you see its shape during a very heavy rainstorm, other than that there is virtually no sign of the creature which was really disappointing as a kid. the story is basically the old evil hunters must kill anything they see and are after the boggy creek creature and kids are out to help it or just some random hairy guy in the woods that likes to pull random boats through the water. not really worth watching i would however like to see the original, granted the maker of that would make the also bad boggy creature of the 80's, but he also made a very good slasher movie in the 70's ""the town the dreaded sundown"".",0
"a common plotline in films consists of the main characters leaving the hustle and bustle of the city behind, and finding themselves in the tranquility of nature. in power of kangwon province, we are shown two stories of individuals doing just that, trying to find themselves through a trip to the popular korean parks in the mountains of kangwon province. however, rather than epiphanal moments, we have two characters whose trip into nature was just another form of escape.  the pace of this movie is slow, contemplative. we learn in the end what really brought each to kangwon province and we learn how they're connected. for those who want hollywood glam and for a movie to give them a definitive answer, this movie will not satisfy. but for those who want a movie that leaves them thinking, wondering, affecting them years after, this movie will more than satiate that longing.",1
"i can sit through this movie once, but i doubt i could make it through a second time. mildly entertaining mainly for the physical presence of lindsay lohan. the fun of matt dillon(think something about mary), and the re-emergence of a more serious acting micheal keaton. this is not the fun romp the love bug was but it is watchable. one of my main detractions from the movie was the fact that herbie had evolved into r2d2 antics for the most part. i was bored with the headlight eyes effects about the second time of the 30 or so times they were used and the bending front fender caused the same reaction from me. go see this with your little ones, i.e. the ""single digit bracket"" kids and don't expect a lot from this film.  _x",0
"in my opinion, this is an absolutely romantic disney masterpiece. if you ask me, the stepmother (voice of lucille la verne) was truly diabolical. you'll have to see the movie if you want to know why. on the other hand, despite the fact that she did a lot of housekeeping, cinderella (voice of ilene stanley) was a very beautiful lady. to me, the scenery was beautiful, the cast was well chosen, and the writing was strong. before i wrap this up, i'd like to say that everyone involved in this film did very well. now, in conclusion, i highly recommend this absolutely romantic disney masterpiece to all of you who haven't seen it. you're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.",1
"a prequel to the re-imagined battlestar galactica series, from the same creative team ronald d. moore and david eick as well as new series co-creator remi aubuchon. caprica is set in the twelve colonies some 58 years prior to the events of battlestar galactica. the new series in addition to its human drama also chronicles the key steps in the development of what would become the cylon race.  the pilot and the series are set to follow two families; the graystone's which include daniel (eric stoltz) a computer genius and corporate tycoon and his equally brilliant but rebellious daughter zoe (alessandra toreson), while the adama's include joseph (esai morales) a lawyer and his son william the future admiral of battlestar galactica.  like battlestar galactica the series includes some great experienced actors in eric stoltz, esai morales and polly walker as well as some very talented relatively new actors including alessandra toreson and magda apanowicz.  for fans of battlestar gallactica there are similarities and continuities with that series but it is also very different. in the pilot at least the science fiction elements are definitely present but are smaller part of this series. the scenes on caprica while reflecting a more technologically advanced society also have retro feel, this is achieved through some of the architecture, the costumes and the way it is shot.  while the look and feel of the two series have some substantial differences some of the themes will seem very familiar, religion is again very important here, while the racial theme rarely touched on in bg is far more important. we also touch on terrorism the existence of a soul and whether or not a machine can have one, as well as issues related to crime and government.  the pilot has been released direct to dvd in an extended and unrated version prior to airing on tv, the series is set to start in 2010.  like battlestar galactica this series is filmed in vancouver",1

"time paradoxes are the devil's snare for underemployed minds. they're fun to consider in a 'what if?' sort of way. film makers and authors have dealt with this time and again in a host of films and television including 'star trek: first contact', the 'back to the future' trilogy, 'bill and ted's excellent adventure', 'groundhog day' and the stargate sg1 homage, 'window of opportunity'. heinlein's 'all you zombies' was written decades ago and yet it will still spin out people reading that short story for the first time.  in the case of terry gilliam's excellent film, '12 monkeys', it's hard to establish what may be continuity problems versus plot elements intended to make us re-think our conception of the film. repeated viewings will drive us to different conclusions if we retain an open mind.  some, seeing the film for the first time, will regard cole, played by bruce willis, as a schizophrenic. most will see cole as a man disturbed by what adams describes as 'the continual wrenching of experience' visited upon him by time travel.  unlike other time travel stories, '12 monkeys' is unclear as to whether future history can be changed by manipulating events in the past. cole tells his psychiatrist, railly (madeleine stowe), that time cannot be changed, but a phone call he makes from the airport is intercepted by scientists after he has been sent back to 1996, in his own personal time-line.  even this could be construed as an event that had to happen in a single time-line universe, in order to ensure that the time-line is not altered...cole has to die before the eyes of his younger self for fate to be realised. if that's the case, time is like a fluid, it always finds its own level or path, irrespective of the external forces working on it. it boggles the mind to dwell on this sort of thing too much.  if you can change future events that then guide the actions of those with the power to send people back in time, as we see on board the plane at the end of the film, then that means the future can be changed by manipulating past events...or does it? the film has probably led to plenty of drunken brawls at bars frequented by physicists and mathematicians.  bonus material on the dvd makes for very interesting viewing. gilliam was under more than normal pressure to bring the film in under budget, which is no particular surprise after the 'munchausen' debacle and in light of his later attempt to film 'don quixote'. i would rate the 'making of' documentary as one of the more interesting i've seen. it certainly is no whitewash and accurately observes the difficulties and occasional conflict arising between the creative people involved. gilliam's description of the film as his ""7½th"" release, on account of the film being written by writers other than himself - and therefore, not really 'his' film' - doesn't do the film itself justice.  brad pitt's portrayal of goines is curiously engaging, although his character is not especially sympathetic. watch for his slightly wall-eyed look in one of the scenes from the asylum. it's disturbing and distracting.  probably a coincidence, the louis armstrong song 'what a wonderful world' was used at the end of both '12 monkeys' and the final episode of the tv series of 'the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy'. both the film and the tv series also featured british actor simon jones.  '12 monkeys' is a science fiction story that will entertain in the same way that the mental stimulation of a game of chess may entertain. it's not a mindless recreation, that's for sure.",1

(all reviewers repeat that phrase, ""pin-up queen of the 1950's,"" like a choir of monkeys.) her history as an american sex bomb is familiar: southern, abused by her father, raped, etc. in this movie she is a naïf, an innocent unaware of the prurient interests she serves and shamelessly profits from. although she believes in jesus, she enjoys frolicking nude before a camera lens -- just the wholesome girl-next-door sex-slave american males supposedly fantasize.  from the mouth of writer-director mary harron herself, oxford-educated and ex-punker (do you smell the combined rot of privilege and ""hipness"" as i do?): ""i feel that without feminism, i wouldn't be doing this. ... i don't make feminist films in the sense that i don't make anything ideological. but i do find that women get my films better."" what a cozy clique.  the movie merely goes through the motions of telling the story of a human life, it's subject and purpose having been eulogized and interred well before the movie began. ms. page has a boyfriend, but we are shown next to nothing about their relationship. in fact, there are no intimate or detailed relationships in the film.   one can't ignore its smug simplicity. in new york, where ms. page tries her best to fit into and appease a man's world, letting herself be tied up in the ropes of bondage and tightly laced into the black leather boots and bodices of s & m, the movie is black and white. but down in miami, where she goes to get away from it all, gleefully takes off her clothes, and is photographed by a ""liberated"" female, the movie turns into color.  like hell harron doesn't ""make feminist films,"" doesn't ""make anything ideological."" ideology has become so internalized, so assumed, so programmed, that it's almost invisible. big brother must be smiling.",0
"like ishtar and king of comedy, other great, misunderstood comedies, envy has great performances by two actors playing essentially, losers (may be too harsh a word, i will call them suburban under-achievers).  this film was a dark comedy gem, and i'm not sure what people expect. i relish seeing a major studio comedy that isn't filled with obvious humor, and i believe that the small moments in this movie make it worthwhile. the look on stiller's face when he sees the dog doo disappear for the first time captures a moment, a moment that most people should be able to recognize in themselves. yes, it was a fairly simple story, but it examined the root of envy in a really interesting way. there were a lot of great scenes (the j-man's decrepit ""cabin by the lake"", corky's unceremonious burial, weitz's wife role, and walken's j-man -- all great stuff.  i can't stand people that get on imdb and mercilessly trash films when they have absolutely no idea what it takes to make one. i will take envy over almost any of the top ten grossing comedies of the year (save napoleon dynamite.) it's wittier, wackier, and an offbeat, enjoyable gem.  remember this people; most times, popular doesn't equal good.",1
"well, no, not really. its not really a good movie, but its not as bad as i thought it was going to be. i really didn't feel ripped off of my rental money, and sometimes thats all you can ask for. the plot is ok, nothing brilliant or new, the acting is pretty bad, but the cast is pretty. the directing is passable, but the effects are horrible, especially the werewolf effects, which in a werewolf movie, is a pretty big problem. there was a fairly decent amount of nudity, which to me is a pretty good thing, but it wasn't all that hot. all in all, its a fairly average direct to video movie, not the worst film i've ever seen and if you're bored a genre fan, check it out sometime. i'd even watch it again.  bonus fact for horror geeks, kane hodder (jason vorhees in a few of them) plays the werewolf.",0
"but the fun is in the journey.  i found this movie to be extremely enjoyable, not only are both leads extremely easy on the eyes, the humor from the supporting cast and the jokes actually made me laugh out loud several times.  yes, it's predictable, and yes, it's a cliché romantic comedy. but the point is that it's a sweet story, the message about finding your one true love also rings true in many ways.  the dialog is dead-on and the acting is well done on all parts, and over the top for comic effect. the bulgari scene is worth it's weight in gold, the actress there deserves honorable mention! for those that panned it for being predictable - if you want a film with twists and turns that keep you guessing... then you want a thriller. this is a romantic comedy... it touched my heart and made me realize that i was lucky enough to find my true love in life, and it has been worth every effort along the way.  great date movie, great movie for a happy cry...",1
"this quasi j-horror film followed a young woman as she returns to her childhood village on the island of shikoku to sell the family house and meet up with old friends. she finds that one, the daughter of the village priestess, drowned several years earlier. she and fumiko (another childhood friend) then learn that sayori's mother is trying to bring her back to life with black magic. already the bonds between the dead and living are getting weak and the friends and villagers are seeing ghosts. nothing was exceptional or even very good about this movie. unlike stellar j-horror films, the suspense doesn't really build, the result doesn't seem overly threatening and the ending borders on the absurd.  this movie is like plain white rice cooked a little too long so that it is bordering on mushy. sometimes you get this at poor asian restaurants or cook your own white rice a little too long. you end up eating it, because you need it with the meal, because what is chinese or japanese food without rice, but it almost ruins the meal because of the gluey, gooey tastelessness of it all. 3/10 http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",0
"where to begin, there's so much wrong and horrible about this movie i am not sure where to start. okay, the two stooges who wrote this crapper. joseph green and rex carlton, first they couldn't make up their so-called minds for a name. my guess they split the difference, that's why the main title is brain that wouldn't die, but the end screen says head that wouldn't die. neither one knows anything about the medical profession. after all doctors take oaths to ""do no harm"". killing a woman for a head transplant would be considered ""harm"". plus, a little thing called blood and tissue matching. rejection would spell death for jan in the pan. plus who keeps a patch work monster. what medical school did bill graduate from, frankenstien university? old fu, or mad scientist tech? the monster had no name, that bugs the hell out of me. plus, the brilliant surgeon doctor bill cortner doesn't know how to keep a patient sedated? all and all a disaster of a movie, it's incredibly stupid and unwatchable, except on mst3k. i give it the thanksgiving turkey.",0
"the exclamation point in the title is appropriate, albeit an understatement. this movie doesn't just cry -- it shrieks loud enough to shatter glass.  filmmakers andrew and virginia stone made shrill, humorless suspense thrillers that strove for a semi-documentary feel. here, they shot on actual new york locations with tinny ""real-life"" acoustics to jack up the verisimilitude. but the naturalism of the sound recording only serves to amplify the stones' maladroit dialog and the mouth-frothing histrionics of tortured butterfly inger stevens.  in a performance completely devoid of modulation, stevens plays the wife of electronics whiz james mason (looking haggard and bored); both are held captive by extortionist rod steiger (looking bloated and bored) and his slimy cohorts in a scheme to blackmail an airline with a deadly bomb that mason has unwittingly helped construct.  here is another credibility-straining instance of a criminal mastermind so brilliantly attentive to every detail, yet knuckleheaded enough to hire a drug-addicted degenerate as an underling. the stones' idea of nail-biting tension is to trap the hysterical stevens alone with benzedrine-popping rapist neville brand, filling the frame with his sweaty, drooling kisser. but the camera work is so leaden and brand so (uncharacteristically) demure that the effect is hardly lurid, much less suspenseful. the stones, a square pair at heart, don't even have the courage of their own lack of convictions.  the film, which ends with the portly steiger chasing the fleet-footed stevens on a subway train track, is as clumsy as its ungainly heavy. with angie dickinson as steiger's amoral girlfriend, jack klugman, kenneth tobey, and barney philips.",0
"1999 will go down in history as the year the movie critic lead the general public astray. first they sent us to eyes wide shut. then they hyped up the blair witch project and now magnolia which is by far the worst movie of the year. what is it about? who the heck knows. its full of self-indulgence and loaded with bad acting. i always like to stay and watch the credits, but when this thing was over i couldn't get out of the movie theatre fast enough. most of the audience that attended the showing that i was at, felt pretty much the same way. dates were arguing with each other as well as strangers. it's an ugly and hateful film that will make you feel ugly and hateful.",0
"the premise for this movie is simple and so is the script: an elderly muslim gets his teenage son to drive him in his similarly elderly station wagon from france to the haj in mecca, saudi arabia, so that he can fulfill his holy muslim obligation before he dies. the father is clearly devoutly religious, but the son is unimpressed; he accepts out of obligation to his father rather than to religion, he'd rather be with his (non-muslim) girlfriend. the father is stubborn in a lot of things which the son doesn't understand and the petulance between them is the device that maintains the drama, although it is often rather irksome. however, like any good road movie there are oddball characters encountered along the way; for example a woman on a backroad in croatia who upon being asked for directions to belgrade simply gets in the backseat and points with her hand uttering one word which they assume to be a place but can't find it on the map. in bulgaria another man they ask directions of confirms he can speak french but then provides an extensive commentary in bulgarian. there is also occasional humor - in one country the son tires of eating egg sandwiches and wants meat - they are given a goat, but unfortunately (perhaps fortunately for the viewer) it runs away before the father can perform the muslim slaughterman ritual. they eventually make it to mecca - the muslim equivalent of the vatican but on a much grander scale. for westerners it is all bizarre but fascinating. the movie isn't sophisticated but is charming in its own way, a kind of national geographic with soul.",1
"exactly what you would expect from a b-movie. deritive, gratuitous nudity, boring in parts, ridiculous gore and cheesy special-effects. of course it could have been better, better acted (defintly) better written, directed, etc. but then i guess it wouldn't have been a b movie. the actors pretty much sucked, in fact this pretty much seemed like an episode of buffy the vampire slayer or something except with a lot of blood, profanity and nudity.  tiffany shepis must be singled out. she absolutely is the scream queen of the new millennium. not that acting really matters in these movies, but she was better than any of the other actors. she's also smokin hot, in that plastic jump suit thing she wore for the whole movie - wow! her posterior is absolutely stunning in that outfit, i mean it every single time she turns around you can help but check her out. and near then end of the film the viewer is rewarded with seeing her completely nekked.  so if your a looser b-movie horror buff (like myself), check this out. if not, you should probably avoid at all costs.",0
"the 1930' were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy. people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams. expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom, majority then condemned to live starving, disillusioned and unwanted, searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms.   young italian-american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest - to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path, having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology. wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though, occasionally, he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive. he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden. the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend.   the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a never-ending relationship of insults, unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath. camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non-perspective racial heritage. though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize.   is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel? is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun? is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn?  it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters, performed by salma hayek and colin farrell, does not work. the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings. hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell's forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida. also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences. a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better, though he looks stunning in a period costume, he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty-year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself.   feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not right. their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm, far from real passion, feelings just described not felt inside. it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted, turned into a grey average of soon-to-be-forgotten.",0
"i sometimes grow weary of reading reviews of some of hitchcock's lesser known films, because almost every single one starts out with someone saying this film is grossly overlooked or this is a hidden hitchcock gem or a true hitchcock great or some other generic if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc. so, that being said, i would just like to say that if - only - people - would - watch - this - they - would - see - that - this - is - a - great - hitchcock - film - just - as - much - as - vertigo - north - by - northwest - psycho - rear - window - etc.  now, that may be overshooting a little bit, the ring is not by any stretch of the imagination even in the same league as any of those films mentioned twice above, but compared to the other films that hitchcock made in the late 1920s and early 1930s, i really think that the ring is one of the best photographed and performed films of mostly all of them. as an almost brand new director, there are some astonishing dream sequences and brilliant segments of editing which show why hitchcock was generating so much attention early in his career.  granted, the film does start with, among other things, the highly disturbing spectacle of an idiot black circus performer (and i use idiot in the definitive manner, the way stephen king so often does) having eggs and fruit thrown at him by a crowd of not the classiest looking white people. i suppose this only illustrates how incredibly different such circuses and people were back then, but i think it is one of the most off-putting sequences in any hitchcock film i've seen.  the main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock any man down in one round, but when he meets his match, it is against a man that challenges his authority not only in the boxing ring but also in the ring around his wife's finger. so begins an entertaining if not very tense challenge for the love of one woman, who seems to sway from one man to the other effortlessly and thoughtlessly.  (spoilers) there is, for example, a scene where her husband watches her from above as she is dropped off at home late at night and, just before going into the building, she is coaxed back to the car for a kiss. this kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that, even at the end when she proves faithful to her husband, or at least ultimately chooses him, they look into each other's eyes but do not actually kiss.  the film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than several films that hitch released in subsequent years. there is also a performance by gordon harker as one round jack's trainer who, in his stone faced expressionism, reminds me quite often of the brilliant buster keaton. hitch leaves it a bit ambiguous, but this is a great sample of his early work.",1
"why would a person go back to a person, who kicks them in the teeth, not once, not twice, but over and over again.  this film teaches us that in order to find love we must accept abuse (not just forgive it, but fully accept it). gosh! no wonder my first relationship only lasted ten years. i obviously wasn't embracing my inner masochist.  as bucatinsky's writing debut, there are many wonderful aspects to this film; however, in order to justify the reunion of eli and tom, more character development would have been helpful. we are never acquainted with eli's masochism, in fact, we are led to believe that he is not a masochist, although tom's psycho-emotional sadism is highly evident.",0

"this has to be one of the best comedies on the television at the moment. it takes the sugary-sweet idea of a show revolving around a close family and turns it into a quite realistic yet funny depiction of a typical family complete with sibling and parent spats, brat brothers, over-protective fathers and bimbo sisters. i'm almost surprised it's disney!  to its credit, '8 simple rules' knows it's a comedy and doesn't try to be more. too many shows (eg, 'sister, sister' and 'lizzie mcguire') think just because its lead characters are now teenagers then they should tackle social issues and end up losing their humour by being too hard-hitting. this is a trap '8 simple rules' has avoided; it does tackle some issues (such as being the school outcast) but it has fun while doing so. in fact the only time it has really been serious was understandably when it sensitively handled the tragic death of john ritter and his character.  and i think, although john ritter will be sadly missed since he was the reason the show made its mark, '8 simple rules' can still do well if it remembers its humour and doesn't make cate's father a second version of paul hennessy.",1

"i have heard a lot about this film, with people writing me telling me i should see it, as i am a fan of extremely bloody, gory movies. i got my hands on it almost right away, but one thing or another always kept me from watching it- until now. i would have been better off not remembering i even had it.  this movie was atrocious. the worst thing though is that it could have been so much better than it actually was. i know it was a story by clive barker and all, and no i have not read that story- but it appears to me that if you haven't then you will be, as i was, completely clueless and utterly disappointed.  the film begins good enough- the actors are convincing, the story interesting. the first scene is bloody- a great way to catch your attention. i thought the blood looked a bit bad, but seeing as it was the very first scene i did hope for improvement later on. i was wrong.   the blood and effects are so horrible, it was almost an insult to my intelligence to be expected to believe that, for instance, someone could knock a person's head right off their shoulders using only a meat hammer. wtf? cgi blood (did they even use any ""real"" blood at all? my home made stuff looks better than any used in this film!), unbelievable acts of dismemberment (eyeballs popping out just from getting hit in the back of the head; arms cut neatly off- does no one remember there are bones all throughout our bodies?!), too-dark scenes (every scene is either an odd yellow color, or in hidden in shadows)...it just gets worse and worse. i found myself pointing out mistake after mistake. there's just too much. add that to the fact that what could have and should have been a great serial-killer movie turns into some demonic/supernatural/monster movie at the end...no thank you! it should have been kept as a creepy guy butchering people in the subway- ok, with a conspiracy theory thrown in- and an overzealous photographer. maybe they murder people and sell the meat via the meat plant? plausible, doable...and a lot better i think than the ""real"" story. that could have and should have worked. instead it became a ""creatures living at the end of the old tunnel and everyone knows about it but you, and unless you read the book, well...you just won't ever understand it"" fiasco. tragic, what an awful thing to do to a movie with such potential. if you like mindless fake blood and gore, you'll love this. but if you have half a brain in your head then you will completely hate it. stay away- far, far away.",0

"rudyard kipling once wrote that god gave to all people the ability to love the whole world, but given that a human heart is very small in size, every human has that special place that he loves more than any other. it seems to me that this may have been the motto of some of the most eminent directors of today when they set out to profess the eternal love for that special place and depict situations in the lives of its denizens and visitors. the result is a wonderful collection of short films, paris je t'aime, in which our guides, van sant, coixet, cuaron, payne and others take us on a breathtaking stroll through parisian arrondissements, human feelings, yearnings and expectations.  always some other quarter, always some utterly moving story about ordinary people in search for love, be it in a parking lot, art studio, tube station. and paris je t'aime is about vast array of loves- love for one's partner, child, parent, for those who meant the world to us but are no longer around, love that needs rekindling, serendipitous love for that stranger as your eyes meet, or love that just is not meant to be...today, but tomorrow- who knows?  nevertheless, this film is not solely about love, but life itself, joy, pain, loneliness, confusion, everyday ups and downs. and its most important quality is the fact that it is not soppy at all, but rather warm and full of hope.  i give this film a 9 because the final section of it suggests how some of the stories might further develop, but not all of them and that is the thing that i find missing, and by ""further development"" i do not mean some specific reference to the characters' future. as far as everything else is concerned i can only say- captivating. makes you want to leave everything behind you, flee to paris and live those little romances yourself.",1
"sarah silverman is really the ""flavor of the month"" comic right now. is she really worth all the hype? yes and no. she is funny at times, sometimes hilariously so (her standup routine is actually quite interesting, though not always funny). other times, you're feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer. she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to, saying that they dig her intelligence and wit. but if you corner them, most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her, and that's why they watch her. she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo, even though neither of them are really ""hot"" now in terms of popularity. sarah doesn't drink or smoke (at least cigs), so she should be hot when she's 60, so her fans (especially the male ones) can rejoice.  as for this show, it's very much like her comedy. when it works, it's hilarious. when it doesn't, it's full blown tedium and very, very boring. the aids episode here is the best one. it's consistently funny, and has some really good satire in it. brian poeshn's character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode, and it's hilarious seeing him in a tab t-shirt. but they never really go anywhere with it, and it eventually wears out its welcome. sarah's character in the series is rather annoying, the gay couple (brian poeshn and some other guy) seems tacked on and never really does anything for the show as a whole, and the supporting players (including sarah's real life sister, laura, who doesn't look a thing like her) are ok. when the jokes hit, they're brilliant. when they don't, they're awful, and i mean really awful. there's also an obsession with coprophilia here (aka poop jokes), which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today. so should you watch this show? if you have a crush on sarah, go for it. you can gaze at her and pretend she's yours. as for her show, it's ranges from good to absolute zero.",0

""summer of sam"" conveys the impression that the film is about the infamous serial killer, david berkowitz. it's not. it's a gritty, earthy portrait of nyc street life during the hot summer of '77 when berkowitz terrorized that city.  the film follows several young fictional characters in an italian-american neighborhood, and their reactions to the son of sam threat. there's vinny and his wife dionna; there's richie and ruby, and several other characters.  the problem is that these characters are not likable. they are routinely annoying, and at times unbearable. lee then belabors their high energy, chaotic lives, which are filled with anger, lust, and general turmoil. there are at least two protracted fight scenes between vinny and his wife, redundant disco dance scenes, countless gabfests ... over and over i kept wondering: where's the film editor?  meanwhile, with all that bulk, the film passes up the chance to convey any real sense of fear or dread arising from the son of sam menace, which is too much in the background. lee is more successful at showing a different kind of menace, that arising from neighborhood vigilante groups.  the acting is uniformly good. that, combined with 70's disco music, and lavish attention to costumes and production design, make you really feel like you are in an italian-american neighborhood in nyc in 1977.  the film's atmospheric authenticity, however, is not nearly enough to offset a rambling, overblown script about the lives of grossly irritating people.",0
"robert altman is my favorite american director. i must admit that i have enjoyed the films that are usually scorned: ""quintet"", if only for giving me the pleasure of seeing a grown-up and beautiful brigitte fossey, who was unforgettable as the little girl in ""forbidden games""; ""health"", for having lauren bacall, carol burnett, alfre woodard and glenda jackson, all in the same cast; ""popeye"", for that splendid and surreal world, shelley duvall's olive oyl and the wonderful malta locations; ""o.c. & stiggs"", for its proposal of an anti-""adolescents flick""; ""beyond therapy"", for all its lunacy and for the presence of genèvieve page, who for all her effort to look parisian chic is taken for a travestite... i have even enjoyed his one-act tv movies, like ""the dumb waiter"" and ""the laundromat"". when there is not much plot to develop in his films, you have wonderful performances, from burnett, john travolta, kim basinger or jane curtin. i perceive and enjoy the different approach and description he makes of the many different cultures of the united states. it is a pity that his genius is seldom appreciated, and that he is always forgotten when the time comes for giving out american prizes and awards. he is not your typical mainstream purveyor of fantasies. he is more of a maverick. so it is not surprising for me to find so many bad comments posted here about ""the gingerbread man"", his most 'mainstream' effort to date and to my knowledge. i did not know there were so many people who thought like leonard maltin, who does not like altman at all. in this case, one may dislike ""the gingerbread man"", but for me the reason has more to do with grisham than with the director-screenwriter. some of altman's trademarks are here: improvised dialogue, great performances, a funny lawyers' office with typical irreverent receptionist and secretary. while some people find it boring, i found the first act fascinating, thanks also for the great cinematography by changwei gu, the man who shot ""red sorghum"", ""ju dou"" and ""farewell my concubine"". he has a way of showing us the same things we see in other american movies, but under a different light. through his ""foreigner's gaze"", almost everything seems new and different. in this first act, things were so logical and true! wait until you get older. you may get in trouble if you fall under the spell of someone younger and beautiful as embeth davidtz. i know for myself what i have done fascinated by someone who is younger than i am! then you have robert duvall's repellent, menacing and mysterious character, while that geraldo storm is threatening savannah. the second act gets a little phony and even funny, because altman may have conducted it with a grin. i remember laughing aloud in several instances with his ironic remarks. i think he was applying a bit of brecht, distancing us, preparing us for the third act, which is plain hollywood pastiche. altman does it with expertise. being a wise man, and an intelligent director, luckily he did not fall into the traps of today's action movies. he was directing a tale of lust, greed and death. i was not disappointed a bit with the movie. if i give it a nine instead of 10, it is because of grisham. the american reader has turned him into a best-selling author. so why complain? maybe we should thank altman for showing us the seams in his stories, the dullness, the flatness and the silliness of them all. however, he does it with so much gusto and humor, that i cannot but disagree with the negative comments. for me, these persons saw another movie... and vice versa.",1
"fairly good romantic comedy in which i don't think i've ever seen meg looking any cuter. all the players did a good job at keeping this a lively romp. of course, in the real world no genius mathematician would even glance at some grease monkey, but that is why i love romantic comedies....one can just totally forget reality and have a good time. nice film. damn, meg is a babe, eh?",1

"simply put, oliver! is one of the greatest musicals of all time. it is filled with memorable songs - ""food glorious food"", ""oliver!"", ""consider yourself"" and ""oom-pah-pah"" to name just a few - and equally memorable characters.  the film is a musical adaptation of charles dickens' classic novel and much like the story of oliver twist itself, it is a perfect family film. there are some frightening moments - the villain bill sykes played by oliver reed is scary enough on his own - but overall, the film will appeal to children of all ages as well as adults.  the story - which almost everyone is surely familiar with by now - revolves around a little orphan boy named oliver and his life growing up in london. at first he lives in the workhouse with the rest of his fellow orphans but after daring to question mr. bumble, the overseer, he is sold to a family as a servant.  after a series of mishaps and close shaves, he meets the artful dodger - superbly played by a young jack wild, who gives his all in the role - and through him, the greedy fagin (ron moody), who trains young boys to pick pocket treasures which he keeps for himself.  the film was shot solely in studios and on soundstages at shepperton film studios but this does not translate at all to film. the sets perfectly replicate victorian london, as do the costumes worn by the characters. a multi-oscar winner and a massive success on its release, oliver! is a worthy contender for the best musical all of time and will delight anyone who loves film.",1
"ben stiller doesn't so much act as react. and he does it very well. he is very dependent on the comedy going on around him. in there's something about mary, the stand-up hair scene only works because of stiller trying to keep a straight face. when he confronts mary's other two suitors, he is the unfunniest guy in the room but the scene is hilarious.  in along came polly, the formula breaks down for reasons that are difficult to fathom. stiller is surrounded by an array of comic talent. hank azaria and philip seymour hoffman get the best lines, of which there are too few. having said that, hoffman relies a little too much on bodily humour - you know we are in trouble when they go to the fart jokes to raise a laugh. a basketball scene where hoffman hams it up is completely overplayed (though it throws up one predicament in the form of a shirtless opponent that does raise a smile - noticeably through stiller's reaction). however, everyone seems to be acting in a bubble, there is very little reaction. hoffman and stiller's characters could have played off each other much, much more. aniston again reprises her rachael role, but stiller is no ross. it is more of a ""joey with a crush on rachael"" scenario.  polly is a by-the-numbers rom-com and that is its failing - it lacks heart. you don't root for the characters. with a little bit more work we could have had a deeper story, but in the end the film's failure comes down to poor writing. worth watching if it pops up on tv on a slow night, but you'll regret forking out cash to see it.",0
"so much has been written about the film's plot, the wonderful acting performance, the script, the melancholy, bittersweet atmosphere, the superb direction - what can i add? just watch for one of the most heart warming, beautifully acted, poignant scenes ever filmed. it is christmas eve and frank morgan's character (the owner of the shop - mr. matuschek)is recovering from his broken marriage and a suicide attempt. as each of his employees leave he invites them to a christmas dinner. each and everyone of them politely turn him down. they all have plans for their own christmas eve. at this stage there is a deep sadness to this moving scene. frank morgan gives the performance of his career and this scene easily brings me to tears. thankfully we have a happy denouement to this very special scene. the new employee, the errand boy, is the last to exit the shop into a beautiful snowy street scene. desperately mr. matuschek approaches this boy and asks him how he would love to spend the evening with him, he will treat him to all the wonderful christmas food that this errand boy has probably never seen!the chap is overwhelmed, he too is obviously as lonely as mr. matuschek and together they can have a wonderful christmas meal. every time i see this scene it moves me. if you manage to get the delightful dvd look at the great trailer with frank morgan introducing himself as mr. matuschek and an appearance by the director of the film- the talented ernst lubitsch. this film is a joy from beginning to end.",1
"ok, first of all, i am a huge zombie movie fan. i loved all of romero's flicks and thoroughly enjoyed the re-make of dawn of the dead. so when i had heard every single critic railing this movie i was still optimistic. i mean, critics hated resident evil, and while it may not be a particularly great film, i enjoyed it if not for the fact that it was just a fun zombie shoot-em up with a half decent plot. this however, is pure crap. terrible dialogue, half-assed plot, and video game scenes inserted into the film. who in their right mind thought that was a good idea. the only thing about this movie (i use the term loosely) that i enjoyed was jurgen prochnow as captain kirk (ugh). while his name throws originality out the window, you can see in his performance that he knows he's in a god awful film and he might as well make the best of it. everyone else acts as if they're doing shakespeare. and very badly i might add. basically the only reason anyone should see this monstrosity is if you a.) are a huge zombie buff and must see every zombie flick made or b.) like to play mst3k, the home game. see it with friends and be prepared for tons of unintentional laughs.

"i remember watching this on prime time when i was about 7 years old. i was a huge comic book reader at the time, and anything relating to superheroes was anticipated heavily. the end result, however, was underwhelming.  i was aware of the ""emma peel"" diana prince stories, as they had only recently come to an end and diana was returned to her amazonian form. however, there was so little action that i was bored throughout most of the movie. the final costume was an interesting idea, but looked more like a cheerleader than a superhero.  i saw the movie again in my late teen years. it hadn't improved much. cathy lee crosby was more familiar, thanks to that's incredible, but her acting was no better. the script had a few good ideas, like the rogue amazon, and a decent villain in ricardo montalban, but it just didn't come together and was still boring.  i think they should have built the back story better, and built the show into a more epic climax. it was too much like a bland spy film, crossed with a superhero story written by someone who had never seen a comic book. the amazon elements were intriguing, but needed to be expanded.  the film did succeed in forcing producers to go back to the drawing board and come up with something more faithful, if a bit too camp and low budget. the budget was also pretty low here, and superheroes don't come cheap.  it would be nice to have the movie available on dvd, if only as a comparison and historical document. even superman 4 is available, and it has nothing over this film (except chris reeve and gene hackman). it's worth seeing for curiosity sake and for a bit of inspiration and caution for future versions.",0
"i saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently, on one of those dollar dvd's that seem to be everywhere nowadays, and was so moved by it that i cannot contain myself. for those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable mexican import, and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone else's jaundiced commentary, there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows. so if you are one of those reckless individuals, stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself. if you get drunk enough in advance, you might be fortunate enough to pass out before it's over.  begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti. no one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of cross-species implantation could occur, and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical. but pour yourself another glass of wine (or whatever you're drinking), and let us proceed.  paul naschy (our werewolf) has the look of a man fighting a toothache, in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey, and has been drunk ever since. (ain't he the lucky one?) naschy's facial expression never varies, whether in or out of makeup, and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf. occasionally he tries to imitate the lon chaney jr. crouch, but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt, like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair. to be fair, the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it, but the continuity is infinitely worse. naschy's werewolf is the only one i can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl. he goes from black shirt to red shirt, then back to black, then back to red, then back to black, all in a single, frenzied night. interestingly enough, he always does the chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt, and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt. and it's only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title. presumably there's something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in him.  so anyway, after being bitten by the cross-pollinating yeti, the poor schmuck returns home from tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students. the two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car. he survives the wreck, and makes it home just in time for a full moon. then, after chewing up his wife and her lover, he wanders off again, and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted. but is that enough? can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace? not a chance. he is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore s/m fetish, otherwise known as ""the doctor"" (and definitely not a new incarnation of doctor who). she digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle, takes him down to the dungeon, chains him to the wall, and gives him a damn good flogging. presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfman.  after his two-shirted rampage, our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle, trying to find a way out. (and who can blame him?) in the course of his wanderings, he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichés, including a man dressed in medieval armor, a curiously inept phantom of the opera impersonator (supposedly the doctor's father), and a hard-partying cadre of bondage slaves.  so what's it all about, one may reasonably ask? one gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control, and involves something the doctor calls ""chemotrodes."" (best guess. i really have no idea how it's spelled, if there even is such a thing.) mercifully, the experiment ends in failure, and most importantly, it ends...before one has time to gnaw one's own leg off.  of course, one doesn't really expect any sense from a film like this, but at least it ought to be good for laughs. this one isn't. forget it, buddy. there is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film, from its patched-together, tequila-drenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score, that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any mst3k type laughs out of it. if it's not even good for that, what the hell is it good for? if montezuma's revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a dvd, it would have looked exactly like this movie.",0
"my giving this a score of 3 is not what i would give the original soviet version of this film. it seems that american-international (a studio that specialized in ultra-low-budget fare in the 60s) bought this film and utterly destroyed it--slicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film! plus, much of this 64 minutes was new material (such as the ""monsters"")--so you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original. the original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the soviet conquest of space--though i really am not sure what it was originally! for insight into the original film, read steven nyland's review--it was very helpful.  by the way, this was the third soviet sci-film i've seen that american-international bought and then hacked apart to make a ""new"" film--standard practice to a company that was willing to put just about anything on the screen to make a buck--provided, of course, it didn't cost them much more than a buck in the first place!! this americanized film was about two rival world powers (not the us and soviets) trying to be the first to mars. the tricky ""bad guys"" try but fail and the ""good guys"" rescue one of the idiot astronauts and then head to mars. unfortunately, they are temporarily stranded on a moon of mars where they see some monsters (added by american-international) that are reaaaally cheesy and one does bear similarity to a certain part of a female's anatomy. then, they are rescued--returning to earth heroes.  the bottom line is that the film was butchered--turning an incredibly beautiful piece of art (for the time) being turned into a grade-c movie. because of this, the soviets really had a reason to hate america! i'm just shocked that the horrible job a-i did with this film didn't convince them to refuse to sell more films to these jerks! it's worth a look for a laugh, but the really bad moments that make you laugh are few and far between. so, the film is a dud--not bad enough to make it a must-see for bad movie buffs and too dopey to be taken seriously. i would really love to see this movie in its original form--it must have been some picture.",0
"maybe ""presque rien"" is not the best movie ever made... but it is better than many of you have said. i still haven't seen a homo-themed movie better than this one.  you americans are accustomed to watch very narrative movies, with a clear beginning, development and outcome. but european movies are less narrative, but makes you think much and feel.  many of you didn't understand the sense of the movie.. the purpose of this one is not show us a simple ""summer loving movie"", with commercial characters who ""fall in love and live happy forever"". summer holidays and beach are only a background, and this movie is directed to every young boy who may feel identified with those boys.  maybe some of you didn't understand well this movie, because of its 3 parts, showed as flashbacks. these 3 moments are: - summertime in pornichet, when they meet and love. - after a year and half living together in nantes, mathieu doesn't go to a psychiatric himself. he tries to suicide taking something, and cedric brings him to hospital. later, he appears talking with a psychiatrist to find the reason about he done that. - the last part, is when mathieu come back to pornichet, in winter, alone.. to think about how his life have changed, how his life become to be, and trying to find himself.  it's possible that some people couldn't understand all this well, because all the scenes are mixed among them. but anyway, as i said before... this is not a funny movie. if what someone want to see is meat, for that, we have belami movies.  presque rien, what want to show us, is how cruel can be the life, for a young boy who is not sure about his feelings and not sure about what to do in life. mathieu only wants to go away from home, and try to live the kind of life that he thought could bring him the happiness.. but what seemed perfect at the beginning.. later is not as good as he thought, and he become troubled, and feel that he has lost the way of his life. he is lost and doesn't know what he really wants to do, or what makes him happy. he finally become depressed and tries to commit suicide.   so, funny? is not a funny movie. very hot scenes? only a few.. but this is not a movie for entertainment. is all about feelings... friendship, love, happiness, unhappiness, pain, depression, loneliness... i, as many others, feel identified with life and problems of mathieu, and that is what director wanted to do.. a movie who show us the cruel reality of a boy's life.  for me, the best homo-themed movie ever.",1
"the plot of this movie hangs on one important point: that this murderer was also a responsible, loving, caring father. not that being a father and a murderer is impossible. but this man is shown murdering a teenage girl without provocation or reason and without emotion. this girl was someone's daughter. i don't think a father who cared so much about his own daughter could have been so cold-blooded to someone else's daughter. or, alternately, could have been so cold blooded and yet worry about and care for his own daughter. and the idea that a convicted murderer would actually ask his victim's parents to take in and care for his daughter is beyond belief.  that said, the characters were acted with conviction by the actors. i thought changing scott bakula's eye color did make him seem more cold and menacing than he usually is. you couldn't see into his eyes at all.",0
"i'm really tempted to reward ""the case of the scorpion's tail"" with a solid 10 out of 10 rating, but that would largely be because i think italian horror cinema of the 1970's is so much better than the cheesy crap i usually watch. but even without an extra point for nostalgia, this is still a genuine masterwork and earning a high rating for its excellently convoluted story, uncanny atmosphere, blood-soaked killing sequences and superb casting choices. in my humble opinion this is actually sergio martino's finest giallo, and that has got to mean something, as ""the strange vice of mrs. wardh"", ""all the colors of the dark"", ""torso"" and ""your vice is a locked room and only i have the key"" are all top-notch genre achievements as well. but this film is just a tad bit superior with its ultra-compelling plot revolving on an insurance fraud gone madly out of control. following her husband's peculiar death in a plane explosion (!), lisa baumer promptly becomes the suspicious owner of one million dollars and she's eager to leave the country as soon as possible. due to the bizarre circumstances, the insurance company puts their best investigator peter lynch on the case and he follows her to greece. there, lisa becomes the target of many assaults and the case's mysteriousness increases when it turns out several people are hunting for the money. i'm always overly anxious when briefly summarizing gialli because i don't want to risk giving away essential plot elements. in ""the case of the scorpion's tail"", the events take an abrupt and totally unexpected turn before the story is even halfway, and i certainly don't want to ruin this for you. many red herrings follow after that, but sergio martino always succeeds to stay one step ahead of you and, even though not a 100% satisfying, the denouement is at least surprising. it's also a very stylish film, with imaginative camera-work and excellent music by bruno nicolai. everyone' s favorite giallo muse edwige fenech oddly didn't make it to this cast (she stars in no less than 3 other supreme martino gialli), but anita strindberg (""lizard in a woman's skin"", ""who saw her die?"") is a more than worthy replacement for her. the charismatic and hunky george hilton is reliable as always in his role of insurance investigator and  duh  ladies' man deluxe. if you're a fan of giallo, don't wait as long as i did to watch this film!!!!",1

"i was so disgusted by this film, i felt obligated to warn off others. this film has no story, plot or hint of purpose. the film starts after the standard ""lets be scary"" movie intro, which by now every film watcher has become accustomed. so we can ignore the beginning completely. we are soon introduced to the main actress and from this point it becomes clear to all that you have just wasted your hard earned and would be better off watching static. (unless you have seen white noise - eek) acting is a disgrace and all of them should return to the travelling pantomime from where they came. having said that, even the best actors in the world would struggle to make this film remotely watch able. their poor performances merely contribute to the disaster. senseless violence and what i can only assume is the written word of yet another junked up ""eccentric"" writer, who probably considers himself to be an artist, has resulted in a film which will test your patience. it was not until my fellow watcher turned to me and said, ""we have been watching this for 45 mins"" did i realise that this film is as thin and tasteless as a cup of tea without a tea bag. clearly something was missing and unfortunately it wasn't the audience. rather than suggest what the film is missing, let me tell you what it has: dumb blonde (surprise surprise), victims, bad-monster-guy-thing, about 2 mins of storyline which is stretched over hours, days, weeks, months... and credits.  want a silver lining? well, the blonde girl is a bit saucy looking in some of the scenes, but expect to want to see her face ripped off for the rest of the film!",0

"every time you think you have a handle on deathtrap, another plot twist comes along. best to just sit back and enjoy the ride on this one. most noted for its on screen kiss between michael caine and christopher reeve (which was unfortunately cut from the televised version i saw), this movie has a great deal more to recommend it.  sidney bruhl (michael caine) is a very unhappy man. once a successful playwright, his last several plays on broadway have flopped. and while his wife myra (dyan cannon) is nothing but supportive, in both the monetary and emotional sense, this does little to make sidney feel any better. to add insult to injury, young playwright, clifford anderson (christopher reeve), has just sent sidney a play to look at. it's anderson's first, and sidney can see that the young man is a gifted writer. he jokes to his wife that he should invite anderson over, kill him, and submit the play as his own. she laughs with him at first, but when sidney actually invites anderson over for dinner, she worries that he may really be putting his scheme into action. and her fears just may be justified...  it's a brilliant script. there are twists and turns all through the plot, and they come faster and more furious as you get closer to the end. it's the kind of film that has you on the edge of your seat from the beginning, and keeps you there the entire time. an absolute masterpiece of suspense and mystery.  the acting is excellent. caine gives his usual excellent performance, and he does exhibit a knack for playing cultured, refined, and intellectual men. reeve also gives an excellent rendering of a man who isn't nearly as wide eyed or innocent as he seems. cannon's franticness works well for myra. and irene worth gives a nice performance as a nosy neighbor who is also a psychic.  this is a film with an ending you'd never expect, and repeated watchings help to pick up on things missed in earlier viewings. an unsung classic that is unfortunately only remembered for a scene which ruffled some sensibilities at the time - and that is a real shame.",1
"i am extremely picky about the films i see. i'd heard about moon child completely by accident. i've been a fan of l'arc en ciel for some time and a fan of gackt and mizer only recently.  i finally found out the film was being re-released and picked it up without a second thought.  being as critical as i am about films, i will admit, the action scenes can be somewhat hokey at times...but they're meant too be, as another user suggested, it's the quintessential calm before the storm, quoting gary oldman from leon...without getting into the spoilers, the film hit me extremely hard, because you realize that the boundaries of friendship are limitless and as they often say, true friendship is loyalty and like marriage, it's until death do you part.  hyde and gackt give performances that showcase why they are able to commit such depth to their song lyrics, their passion for music happens onto the big screen and in the process it creates an exemplary film that will reach into one's soul and evoke response emotionally.  upon seeing the film for the first time, i realized it will probably remain in heavy rotation as far as my collection goes. i want to encourage anyone reading this post to pick up the film if you want to get away from the current hollywood trend in film...this takes an entirely new direction using classic yakuza film elements and how can you go wrong with a cameo from ryo ishibashi of takashi miike's ""audition"" and ""suicide club"" fame?  man..i just can't say enough about this film, but i'll stop here.  10/10",1

"""house of evil"" aka ""dance of death"" of 1968 is the first of four infamous and odd last movies starring the great boris karloff and directed by jack hill and juan ibánez. unlike ""snake people"" (1971), ""the incredible invasion"" (also 1971) and ""the fear chamber"" (1972) which were all released after karloff's death in 1969, ""house of evil"" was released in 1968, when karloff was still alive. ""house of evil"" is regarded by many as the worst of these four movies, which are without doubt all rather crappy, but definitely have their entertainment value as the unintentional comedies they are. i personally prefer ""the fear chamber"" and ""house of evil"" over the other two, simply for the reason that the lack of the slightest logic is even more extreme, and since there is no suspense whatsoever in any of the movies, the lack of logic increases the unintentional fun factor.  the odd story (i don't know if i can really call it a 'plot') is set somewhere in europe in the 19th century. after some girls are murdered and found with their eyes ripped out, mathias morteval (karloff), an enthusiastic organ player, invites his few remaining relatives to his bizarre mansion, which is full of eerie toys. his kinfolk includes lucy durant (julissa), who is engaged to one of the police inspectors investigating the murders.  i won't give away more of the story, but i can assure you that it is quite bizarre throughout the movie. there are some very funny moments, especially some things karloff's character says. boris karloff was without any doubt one of the most brilliant and important icons of the horror genre who ever lived, and he manages to award this odd movie with a tiny bit of his greatness, and although (or because) his role is (due to a poor script and and directing) in no way scary, it looks like he deliberately plays it with a sense of humor. just like in the movie's successors ""snake people"" and ""the fear chamber"", the female lead is once again played by julissa.   most of he supporting performances are hilariously amateurish, the cinematography is terrible and the locations and sceneries are beneath contempt. the storyline lacks the least bit of logic and the dialogue often does not make the slightest sense. it is the poor story and dialogue, however, that makes this movie so entertaining to watch. ""house of evil"" may be an extremely crappy attempt of a movie, but it is certainly as (unintentionally) funny as it is bad. fans of ed wood's movies should be very amused, i personally found it hilarious. crappy but entertaining nevertheless, and definitely worth watching since there's boris karloff in it and due to the fun factor. 3/10",0
"i can admit that the screenplay isn't very good, and that it has some slow parts, but all of you critics of this movie need to learn how to have some fun. first of all, the performances are great (michael douglas, kim basinger, kiefer sutherland, and eva longoria. michael douglas proves he has still got it, and kim basinger plays a very interesting character as the cheating wife. kiefer sutherland and eva longoria, play the dynamic duo, both adding their incredible talent to the pot. and second of all, this movie is the most fun i have had in years in a theodore. its plain and simple, if you want to go to the movies, and have a lot of fun see, the sentinel.",1
"at the beginning of the movie, the beautiful photography and the scenes of the fox were amazing. however, the story was so very slow and boring. and then the little girl begins to domesticate the fox, which leads to tragic events. we live in the forest, and frequently see foxes. one thing anyone should know is that you leave wild animals to be wild, and enjoy them from afar. this movie sets a terrible example to the children who will be watching it, in trying to make a wild creature into a pet. i do not know what the point of the story was supposed to be. even after the terrible events with the main fox, the little girl was still wanting to play with the kits. does she never learn her lesson? and there are other scenes featuring predator animals to the fox, which only adds to the trauma inflicted on children watching this movie. what a disappointment this movie was. and what a horrible story it tells. the final narrated dialog was so stupid, by which time my wife and i were screaming at the tv! i absolutely hated this movie, and would never recommend it to anyone!",0
"rock star john norman howard (kris kristofferson) turns lounge singer esther hoffman (barbra streisand) into an overnight singing star. esther's star rises while john's goes into decline, thanks to drugs and alcohol. after about two hours, john does the self-destructive-red-converible-160-mph-crack-up-on-a-desert-highway thing. the best thing about this movie is the music, especially the song, ""evergreen."" barbra streisand sings well, but you can't take her seriously as an up-and-coming star, when she is *already* a star. the very first time she appears, singing in a back alley bar, she looks like an established singing star who is slumming for the night, not like a struggling unknown who is trying to launch her singing career. she is too confident, too professional. her apartment looks like a page out of ""apartment living,"" not some hole-in-the-wall apartment where a real struggling singer would live.  kris kristofferson handles the self-centered, out-of-control rock star role like...well, like a singer who is trying to be an actor but doesn't have much acting talent. the direction is tepid, the story is slow and dull.  but the worst thing about this movie is not the acting, or the lame direction, or the slow story. it's the hair! after staring at kristofferson's and streisand's awful 70's hairdos for 2+ hours, your eyes hurt.",0
"i could only get through about 25 mins of it. not one laugh in the 25 minutes i gave it, one of the most painful films i've ever had to endure. chris kattan is so nervous on screen that it made me nervous to watch him. just a horrible movie.",0
"peter jacksons version(s) are better films overall from objective point of view. that being said, they are not my favorite screen versions of lord of the rings, and let me explain why.   firstly, the acting of the on-screen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with jackson's lotr. the whole cast is too run of the mill. ""are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of ralph bakshi version are better actors than real people?"" one could ask. well, they are not really silly(save for hobbits, later about them) and they certainly pack more personality than jackson's party - even with much more limited dialogue time. and that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the bakshi's lotr. take aragorn for example. in this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authority(aragorn the lord)and with a seasoned rasp(aragorn the ranger). this is due to john hurt's brilliant voice acting. compare that to viggo mortensen's rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven: hurt beats mortensen hands down.   and then there is gandalf. probably the most dominating(and the most popular) character in the whole saga. in this bakshi version gandalf(william squire) is a real wizard. and by that i don't mean he shoots bolts from his fingertips(he does not), but his presence is just captivating. he is a mystical, powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease. add to that his looks: tall, old as the ancient oak, beard long as his body, sharp eyes, wizardy hook nose and of course, the classical wizard hat. a perfect gandalf, just like in the books. ian mckellen's gandalf in the other hand, is simply just too boring. he looks too human, sounds too human, acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword. yes a sword. in this bakshi version gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his sword(as he did in the books). and those are stylish slow motion kills. gandalf is not a power to be messed with. and it must be noted, that while i'm sad to say this, the great christopher lee didn't bring saruman alive. fraser kerr in this movie did, even with a very limited screen time and lines.  before i move completely to visual aspects of the movie, it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the orcs are also superior to jackson's pretendeous bad guys. bakshi's orcs taunt their enemies(or each other) constantly with growls, screams and nasty language. they are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion. and finally, the black riders - or the nazgul. those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one - not just some riders wearing black. and they speak with haunting voice, which mesmerizes their victim. my favorite scene in the film is when the nazgul are chasing frodo near the river. while peter jackson couldn't do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party, bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering sky.  but as much i like this film more than jackson's, the latter are, if only technically, still better. and that is because of some key visuals. as you know bakshi lotr features a mixture of animated characters(all hobbits and the main cast) and real actors covered with paint. i don't really have a problem using real people in animation this way, but they just don't fit very well with traditional cartoon figures. this is especially true with humans(riders of rohan, tavern people etc.) orcs are different matter, since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters. orcs, while played by humans with animation mix, look far superior to jacksons version. they have brownish-green skin, shiny red eyes, flat face and pointed teeth.   biggest screw up in this films visuals, howerver, are the hobbits. while i prefer almost every character in bakshi version compared to jackson, the latter has clearly superior hobbits, in fact they are perfect. with bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid disney bambies. and you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them, so be warned. again, the voice acting is ok with them too, but the actors mouths cannot save the ""immersion damage"" made by these little weasels. well, i never really liked those halflings anyway.   general failures in the bakshi script are well known. limited playing time(with limited budget) and a lot of missing scenes. so while this film covers nearly half of the story, it doesn't do it in extensive detail compared to jackson's version.   in a summary the ralph bakshi version of lotr has a superior:  -overall atmosphere (it feels more like middle-earth) -overall voice acting -music (i really dig the fantasy score by kont & rosenman) -gandalf -aragorn (one of the john hurt's finest roles) -king theoden -orcs -black riders -elrond (he's not some fairy hippie in this one!)  while jackson version is better:  -because it covers the whole story -overall visuals and special effects -gollum/smeagol -balrog -hobbits  lord of the rings by ralph bakshi, even with it's well known shortcomings, is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of tolkien's fantasy world very well, if not perfectly. i'll give it a score of 8½ out of 10.",1
"did anyone read the script. this has to be some of the worst writing and directing of the entire year. three great actors, paul giamatti, rachel weisz and miranda richardson couldn't pull this one out. about two-thirds it looked like giamatti eyes were saying, i can't believe i signed the contract. it's not the worst movie i ever saw, but it's on the really really bad christmas movie list. not enough lines, but what else can be said? okay, the movie just doesn't move with vaughn's con-man dialogue, his character is just a creepy guy that you just can't get past. it was just a lackluster walk through, that no one seemed to be able to get into.",0
"of course, by any normal standard of film criticism, soldier is a very poor film indeed. kurt russell is a futuristic super soldier raised since birth to kill but then made obsolete after being bettered by a bunch of really super soldiers at a dangly hoop ruck that looks a bit like a gladiators contest without the crash mats.  abandoned on a junk planet, he's befriended by a community of naff space hippies that teach him about gardening, family life and, um, breasts. kurt doesn't talk much. finally the really super soldiers turn up and kill the hippies by shooting them in the back while they're running away. kurt gets angry and kills everyone. a planet gets totalled. the end.  unless the academy start a new category for ""best explosion"", soldier is not going to win any awards. however, as ludicrous as it is, it remains an enjoyable experience. the military hardware is the coolest since aliens (the apc's especially) and, at 90 minutes long, it doesn't outstay its welcome. please note that the below mark is only a guide. knock five points off if you intend to take it seriously and discount one more if you don't like miniguns.  7 out of 10",1
"the movie confuses religious ethics and ideals so much that it fails to create coherent argument against the death penalty on any level. by presenting the lawful execution of a convicted murder as the catalyst for the apocalyptic end of mankind the movie elevates a parent killer to the status of martyr for christ. somehow, according to the plot, god is outraged that society has chosen to rid it's self of a fanatic who killed his own parents by starting them on fire while they slept defenselessly in their beds. yet this same god has no indignation for the acts of the killer. the lead character, an nonreligious pregnant suicidal woman, ultimately gives her own life in a defiant but implausible attempt to unsuccessfully save this convicted killer. in other threads of the underdeveloped plot jesus comes back as a powerless and frustrated vagabond to symbolically unleash the wrath of god. the modern lackluster incarnation of christ not just dehumanizes him but mocks the messianic ideal of all religions as well. he is unable to affect humanity for good and unemotionally skates the edges of life waiting for mankind to destroy it's self. meanwhile, with little help from jesus the mentally unstable pregnant woman finds herself with the ability to reincarnate herself into her newly born soulless child which somehow saves all of mankind from the wrath of the almighty. i also interpreted that as a statement in support of abortion on some levels. this movie which attempts to weave many religious themes into a thriller fails to make any religious point that i could clearly interpret except to mock people's beliefs. it raises many questions that it never even attempts to answer. it disregards the religious values of its audience while attempting to portray an asinine version of their fulfillment. silly",0
"when i first saw the title i was already deducing the theme of the film - it clearly wasn't a reference to british currency, so it had to be shakespearian and about pounds of flesh - taking them, or giving them. will smith's a feelgood actor, so serial killers were out. it could only be about a man giving them, so must be about guilt somehow. i spoilt the whole thing for myself by looking it up and knowing the story before i watched, as the beauty of the build-up is the way parts of the main character's background are drip fed to slowly illuminate the audience as to who he is and why he is doing what he is doing.  guilt is a very hard subject to do simply because it's deeply uncomfortable and sad, which is not an encouraging premise when you are hoping for a roller-coaster ride - you know its going to be unpleasant. i wouldn't say the movie glorifies suicide; it delves into the most extreme form of self-sacrifice - martyrdom.  it's also brimming with symbolism everywhere, which is a surefire tell-tale sign that the writing is cleverly thought out in great detail and driving at multiple meanings and a deep reflective nature. the most prominent theme that struck me was that he was not only giving his heart to the girl he loves emotionally and metaphorically, but was giving it to her physically as the greatest gift he could. determined to die, but his plan is thwarted by falling in love - what a 2nd act complication. absolutely masterful.  yes it is very slow-paced, but i'm undecided as to whether it would have been better slotted into a smaller timeframe. i didn't feel the strain and his terrible inner turmoil as much as i could have, but maybe that's just me having ruined it for myself beforehand. saying all that though, it is a deeply moving and original film that is an incredibly powerful and thought-provoking tragedy that deserves the awards it will inevitably get.",1
"this is the first michael vartan movie i've seen-i haven't seen alias- and i was curious to see if the guy can act.he sure can and is likable in this movie.natasha henstridge is of course gorgeous but she is usually in more physical and action roles,so i found her very good and lovable in this different""sweet"" role of a schoolteacher. some of the negative comments i read are true,the movie is full of clichés and the story doesn't ring true at all.also,even though every character in the movie remarks how good they look together,i don't think there is screen chemistry there. however,i enjoyed this movie.the locales are nice,the characters are likable and goodlooking and the supporting actors are pretty good. if you are expecting to see a great romance,this is not it.but if you want to see a pleasant innocent goodlooking movie with likable characters its very good.",1
"a bit of a disappointing film, i'd say: the acting was stilted, somehow. in many cases, i just couldn't feel that the facial expressions matched the words spoken or the intent of the scene. an angry (or sad, happy, frustrated) character should make the viewer believe that he's angry (or sad, happy, frustrated). that doesn't happen here.  the comment about the writers assuming you already know the characters was apt. they do things and say things which come out of nowhere: the character andrew accuses his parents of sending signals to each other at dinner; then he blows up and storms out, telling his father ""don't touch me, you f***!"". maybe, if we'd seen the prequel, we would understand where all that comes from, but there is no prequel, so we're somewhat at sea as to the reason!   one odd, quirky thing that andrew does is to go to an old stone quarry, sit down on the edge overlooking the ""still water"" below; then he reaches into his jeans pocket and extracts a pack of cigarettes and lights one up. he did this same thing three times during the film; i guess we're supposed to see this as some tortured act of being alone and angry? maybe once, but three times? it might even have been four times, i lost count.  to be honest, there is the fact that he's recently found out that he's adopted; this happens very early in the film so there's no sense of any dramatic change he might be undergoing because of this discovery. it's not really clear if that's why he's so bitter or if it's about something else.  i guess there is a sort of lynchian feel to the film but should a first-time director really be trying to scale such a mountain so early in his career?",0
"''ranma ½"" is my favorite anime by rumiko takahashi. the woman really knows how to entertain us with a good story, that is not only a comedy, but also an action anime. the main character of the story is ranma saotome, a teenager boy who is also an expert in martial arts. ranma is engaged to akane because of an arrangement of both fathers, who are great friends and trained together during many years.   akane is the younger and most violent sister of the tendo's: kasumi is the oldest and is very sweet and nabiki is the middle and loves to win money no matter what.  ranma and akane fight all the time,specially because both have a very bad temper, and when they discover that ranma becomes a girl when splashed with cold water as well as his father becomes a panda,many new characters and situations starts to happen. they also discover the reason of the transformation: while fighting, ranma and his father fell in a cursed river. but not only them had this kind of fate...  if you watched ''ranma 1/2'' and liked, i would recommend you ''inuyasha'' and ''maison ikkoku"", two other good creations from rumiko's hands.",1
"man's castle is set in one of those jerry built settlements on vacant land and parks that during these times were called 'hoovervilles' named after our unfortunate 31st president who got stuck with the great depression occurring in his administration. the proposition of this film is that a man's home is still his castle even when it's just a shack in a hooverville.  spencer tracy has such a shack and truth be told this guy even in good times would not be working all that much. but in a part very typical for tracy before he was cast as a priest in san francisco, the start of a slew of classic roles, he's playing a tough good natured mug who takes in loretta young.  one of the things about man's castle is that it shows the effects of the depression on women as well as men. women had some additional strains put on them, if men had trouble finding work, women had it twice as hard. and they were sexually harassed and some resorted to prostitution just for a square meal. spence takes loretta young in who's facing those kind of problems and makes no demands on her in his castle. pretty soon though they're in love, though tracy is not the kind to settle down.  the love scenes had some extra zing to them because tracy and young were having a torrid affair during the shooting of man's castle. and both were catholic and married and in those days that was an insuperable barrier to marriage. both tracy and young took the catholic faith quite seriously.  also in the cast are walter connolly as a kind of father figure for the whole camp, marjorie rambeau who's been through all the pitfalls young might encounter and tries to steer her clear and arthur hohl, a really loathsome creep who has his eye on young as well. hohl brings the plot of man's castle to its climax through his scheming.   man's castle is grim look at the great depression, not the usual movie escapist fare for those trying to avoid that kind of reality in their entertainment.",1
"after life is a miracle, i did not expect much. it's hard to believe that these films were made by the same man as do you remember dolly bell, for instance. zavet is two hours of silly antics with no story. the wild and unbridled humor of underground seems to have degenerated into pathetic buffoonery here. it appears that kusturica has been going steadily downhill since he started making life-affirming comedies, beginning with black cat, white cat, which i think was great, but already had some disturbing signs of dementia. i liked his early films so much, and this is why it's especially disappointing to see something like this. let's hope his next one will be great.",0

"i actually liked this movie until the end. sure, it was cheesy and pretty unlikely but still it kept my attention on a rainy afternoon. until the end, that is. for her final performance at the prestigious classical conservatory where she has struggled to catch-up to the other classically trained students, what does the main character do? wow them with her grasp and execution of this time honored musical tradition? no. she tortures and butchers the great sensuous habanera from carmen and turns it into an utterly forgettable brittany spears-wannabe pop song. my ears bled! and, in the supreme moment of horror, her teachers gave her a standing ovation! any teacher not in a spears-induced fantasy would have failed her on the spot. save your time, save your ears - skip this movie!",0
"when we were in junior high school, some of us boys would occasionally set off stinkbombs. it was considered funny then. but the producers, directors and cast of ""semana santa"" (""angel of death"" in the dvd section of your local video rental) are adults and they are still setting them off.  like the previous reviewer who wondered if the cast were anxious to get off the set and home, i doubt more than one take was done for any of the scenes.  mira sorvino, hot in ""mighty aphrodite"" and other top-rated films, seems to have undersold herself to this project. her acting is non-existent, confined mostly to wistful stares that are supposed to indicate how ""sensitive"" she is to the plight of the film's various victims.  but let me warn you--do not be the next victim! step away from the dvd if you find it on the shelf. tbere are not many good leg shots of mira (the only high points i could find in the film) and the supporting cast is of inferior quality, delivering a mishmash of badly-done dialogue with embarrassing ""spanish"" accents worthy of the best high school theatrical production.",0

"hello, this little film is interesting especially for an artist, film-maker or music creator or a visual artist, for:  one can feel and examine david's touch/style straight out of a short piece of relative simplicity.  you can see the rhythmic spacing of the shots, the pans and the sound elements.   even as simple film, this creation is multy-layer. for example, there are some sounds that drone all along, while others appear (though subtle), at certain points to support certain shots.  one can see also several types of pans: some go up and down in a gentle back-forth way. there is diagonal pan. zooms also go back and forth sometimes.  the lightning and the composition/disposition of elements in the space is, as usual and obviously, work of a painer/artist. this can be felt even in this crappy room. this is to say: one can make exquisite art already by the simple art of placing the look/view and composing the scene. then comes the forcelines of the visuals: like digonales, parallels, etc. the light's degradées and the colours, although without too much research for textures as in big productions, are fine too. this is an artist's sketch of a sort...  all this is not calculated but done with inner feeling and this feel gives the david's touch/feel to it, as with any true artist.",1
"just watched this after hearing about how bad it was and wanted to see for myself. seriously, even if you read all the negative comments on here you will be nowhere near able to comprehend how awful this film actually is, although it has to be one of the most hilarious things i have ever seen! never bothered to post a comment on here before, but this piece of crap really warrants it.   firstly the entire plot is ridiculous and nonsensical. brother of the lead character (either ben or arthur, i forget which is which, and frankly it's never very clear) wants to stop some kind of gay marriage by killing everyone in sight - because homosexuality is abhorrent to christians, but apparently mass murder isn't. then there's some other crap thrown in about one of the gay couple's ex-wife trying to force him to remarry her at gunpoint. this leads to nothing, but provides us with one of the funniest lines of dialogue in the whole ""film"" - ""i don't make sense? you don't make sense! that's who makes sense!"". brilliant.  then there's the acting, which is just atrocious. it must be seen to be believed. my personal favourite is the apparently stoned civil rights lawyer woman, who is clearly reading her lines off of something, yet still managing to mess them up. enough said. the gay couple couldn't be less convincing. there's the vaguely attractive and completely gormless guy, and his boyfriend who looks like that little cartoon dough man of the bisto adverts. only fatter. and less talented.   the ""film"" has also been filmed by someone who is incapable of holding a camera even remotely still, and the number of mistakes throughout is amazing. the whole thing kicks off with the fat main guy in bed with a pair of boots on. yep.  but anyways, we all know how terrible this thing is, so i'd like to highlight some of the most priceless comedy moments that the ""film"" provides.   - when the fat guy sets the church on fire and then prances like a six year old girl across the car park to make his escape. hilarious.  - mildread! no idea what relation she is to the main characters - sometimes they know her, sometimes they don't, but she pops up in a couple of scenes nonetheless. hilarious.  - the stoned lawyer. already mentioned her, but she's so funny she's worth another mention.  - the evil brothers dinner of crackers that he lays on for his guests.  - the evil brother's anti-gay potion.  - the evil brother's cats.  - the ending, which i won't give away because it must be seen to be believed. i warn you though, make sure you're not eating at the time!!!! the tub of lard main character/director/producer gets naked. it's foul.   basically, ben and arthur is indescribably bad, but unintentionally the most comical thing you'll see for a long time. literally, nothing is good about this excuse for a film, the goon of a director even manages to make the opening credits into a joke by writing his own name about 15 times.",0

"i am not so much like love sick as i image. finally the film express sexual relationship of alex, kik, sandu their triangle love were full of intenseness, frustration and jealous, at last, alex waked up and realized that they would not have result and future.ending up was sad.  the director tudor giurgiu was in amc theatre on sunday 12:00pm on 08/10/06, with us watched the movie together. after the movie he told the audiences that the purposed to create this film which was to express the sexual relationships of romanian were kind of complicate.  on my point of view sexual life is always complicated in everywhere, i don't feel any particular impression and effect from the movie. the love proceeding of alex and kiki, and kiki and her brother sandu were kind of next door neighborhood story.  the two main reasons i don't like this movie are, firstly, the film didn't told us how they started to fall in love? sounds like after alex moved into the building which kiki was living, then two girls are fall in love. it doesn't make sense at all. how a girl would fall in love with another girl instead of a man. too much fragments, you need to image and connect those stories by your mind. secondly, the whole film didn't have a scene of alex and kik's sexual intercourse, that 's what i was waiting for. however, it still had some parts were deserved to recommend. the ""ear piercing "" part was kind of interesting. alex was willing to suffer the pain of ear piercing to appreciate kik's love. that was a touching scene which gave you a little idea of their love. also, the scene of they were lying in the soccer field, the conversation express their loves were truthful and passionate.",0
"this thrown together piece of fecal matter adds together so many ludicrous scenarios that in the end it's a laugh riot of absolute hilarity. too bad as the premise is promising (as it so often is in duhllywood), but in the hands of this scriptwriter it segues off into la la land.   lowe is in prison serving time for a dui that killed off his mistress. we get to see him having nightmares just so that we know he feels real bad about this. then his cell mate neighbor hangs himself. or does he? lowe has some suspicions but drops them quickly. his suspicions are so weak that the bad guys have nothing to worry about. so why do they then set him up to be killed? ah, that's where this story could get interesting. that's where it falls off the rails, and once off the rails it decides it can get away with insulting the viewers attention for the next numbing hour.  ****************spoilers****************************  i won't bore with an endless recounting of the irrationality of what follows, but contemplate this ending. lowe has been trapped by the bad guys on a train. they want a tape he has, because that tape will screw their boss, and them. so on to the train come 3 cops, guns drawn, ready to rescue lowe. the bad guys kill the cops, in front of half the passengers and then....continue chasing lowe to get the tape. hello!!!! killing 3 cops in public will get you into deep doodo, to hell with the tape. yet off they go through a mall shooting up the place, as if the public did not exist as witnesses, and in the end lowe is grabbed and the bad guy still wants the tape!!!",0
"roman polanski masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as repulsion. i can't imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in le locataire, yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people, myself included.  polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters (deneuve in repulsion and himself in le locataire), starting with some lack of self-assurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise. the shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from the fright and tension of horror movies since there's no tangible supernatural element here. while horror movies allow for some kind of catharsis (be it cheap or more elaborate) polanski sadistically tortures us and, if in his latter opus the dark humour is permanent, we are mostly on our nerves as opposed to on the edge of our seats.  suspense, horror, all this is a matter of playing with the audience's expectations (alternatively fooling and fulfilling them), not literally with people's nerves. in my book rosemary's baby is a far greater achievement because sheer paranoia and plain rationality are in constant struggle: the story is about a couple moving in a strange flat, while we are forced to identify with a sole character. what's more if the fantasy elements are all in the hero's mind the situation is most uncomfortable since we, the viewers, are compelled to judge him, reject him while we have been masterfully lured (""paint 'n lure"") into being him.",1
"""the deadly look of love"" is essentially ""fatal attraction"" with a couple of twists added onto the back half. the ending will not surprise anyone who has seen more than two or three movies of the week. it is yet another cautionary tale about succumbing to temptation, and it adds nothing fresh to the genre.  brett (vincent spano) is engaged to a beautiful woman who just happens to have a sizable trust fund. even though he has it all, he risks losing everything by starting up a steamy side affair with janet (jordan ladd). janet, a doe-eyed blonde from cedar falls, falls hard for brett, and she does not take it particularly well when he comes clean about his engagement. shortly after the wedding, mrs. brett turns up dead in the master bedroom of the large, luxurious home she shared with her new husband. when the police question brett, he promptly points the finger at janet. following her arrest, janet seems to get loonier by the minute - not that she was the picture of stability before. her defense attorney (holland taylor) is convinced that janet is innocent and is hell bent on proving it.  did she do it or didn't she? how will it end? you can find out the answers to these questions the next time ""the deadly look of love"" airs on your local station. and be sure not to miss the moral of this beautiful story: men are pigs, and women are crazy.",0
"i don't remember this film getting a cinema release over here. i only saw it when it came onto cable. the film deals with the dehumanisation of children into killing machines. specifically one person, the way he gets replaced and dumped (literally) into an off-world community where he finds himself unable to cope with coming to terms with who he really is and what he feels.  seems to me that a lot of people expected this to be rambo in space, and would have been happy if it was.  i'm certainly happy it was'nt - kurt does a fine job of portraying an emotional cripple. the scene where he's sitting outside the compound shows this, albeit the decision for two slow-mo replays detracts from the moment.  this is not a classic sf movie in the way that bladerunner, alien, silent running, logan's run or thx1138 were, however it is unfortunately the nearest i've seen to it in a long time.  he changes in the movie to a believable degree, he does'nt crack arnie one liners, he does'nt become snake plissken and there is no definative happy ending.  that's why this film did'nt do well. it did'nt follow formula, and among a 18-25 year old target american audience, that's unforgivable as it was was'nt what they expected to see.  fear and discipline.  always.",1
"at what point exactly does a good movie go bad? when does a movie go from ""watchable"" to ""where's that &^@_+#!* off switch""? thank goodness for dvds, like this one, that can be borrowed from the library - for free! likewise, thank goodness for the ""fast forward"" switch on the dvd player. i feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box office.  at one point (i've forgotten exactly when because now it's all just a blur), our ""hero,"" luke wilson starts running through traffic; i think he was looking for a cab. it was at that point when i gave up, realizing i couldn't care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truck.  the last time the movie was interesting was when luke wilson climbs out of the dumpster, hair dryer in hand, and first meets the ""heroine,"" uma thurman. that scene ended with the purse-snatching criminal dangling helplessly from the fire escape far, far above the departing luke and uma. that was the last time the movie was funny, and when was that scene? ten minutes into the flick?  every time the movie tried to become ""funny,"" it couldn't. every time the movie approached ""excitement,"" it fizzled out, heading in the opposite direction. when a musical score might have helped squeeze life out of this dullard, the sound track stayed empty and silent.  the sex scenes were not needed and were beyond lame; the damage to sets and props unnecessary and childish. when uma turns into the crazy ex-girlfriend, i felt like i was watching ""the 40 year old virgin meets pulp fiction""; that's when i realized that there was no turning back because i thoroughly disliked ""the 40 year old virgin"" and ""pulp fiction.""  luke wilson's sidekick, rainn wilson (also seen in the dreary ""the last mimzy"") adds nothing but insult to injury in this awful movie. rainn wilson, the king of television boredom, should stay with that equally awful medium. hey, rainn wilson! leave full-length motion pictures alone! every time uma's rival, anna faris, came on screen, i expected jason or freddy or some fright flick monster to jump out from behind the scenery; once you see anna faris in ""scary movie,"" that's all you ever see, no matter the movie, no matter the medium. the character played by wanda sykes was just plain awful and was so out of place in this flick.",0

"when an attempt is made to assassinate the emir of ohtar, an arab potentate visiting washington, d.c., his life is saved by a cocktail waitress named sunny davis. sunny becomes a national heroine and media celebrity and as a reward is offered a job working for the protocol section of the united states department of state. unknown to her however, the state department officials who offer her the job have a hidden agenda.  a map we see shows ohtar lying on the borders of saudi arabia and south yemen, in an area of barren desert known as the rub al-khali, or empty quarter. in real life a state in this location would have a population of virtually zero, and virtually zero strategic value, but for the purposes of the film we have to accept that ohtar is of immense strategic importance in the cold war and that the american government, who are keen to build a military base there, need to do all that they can in order to keep on the good side of its ruler. it transpires that the emir has taken a fancy to the attractive young woman who saved him and he has reached a deal with the state department; they can have their base provided that he can have sunny as the latest addition to his harem. sunny's new job is just a ruse to ensure that the emir has further opportunities to meet her.  a plot like this could have been the occasion for some hilarious satire, but in fact the film's satirical content is rather toned down. possibly in 1984 the american public were not in the mood for trenchant satire on their country's foreign policy; this was, after all, the year in which ronald reagan carried forty-nine out of fifty states in the presidential election and his hard line with the soviet union was clearly going down well with the voters. (if the film had been made a couple of years later, in the wake of the iran/contra affair, its tone might have been different).  the film is not so much a satire as a vehicle for goldie hawn to show off her brand of cuteness and charm. sunny is a typical goldie character- pretty, sweet-natured, naive and not too bright. there is, however, a limit to how far you can go with cuteness and charm alone, and you cannot automatically make a bad film a good one just by making the leading character a dumb blonde. (actually, that sounds more like a recipe for making a good film a bad one). goldie tries her best to save this one, but never succeeds. part of the reason is the inconsistent way in which her character is portrayed. on the one hand sunny is a sweet, innocent country girl from oregon. on the other hand she is a 35-year-old woman who works in a sleazy bar and wears a revealing costume. the effect is rather like imagining rebecca of sunnybrook farm grown up and working as a bunny girl.  the more important reason why goldie is unable to rescue this film is even the best comedian or comedienne is no better than his/her material, and ""protocol"" is simply unfunny. whatever humour exists is tired and strained, relying on offensive stereotypes about arab men who, apparently, all lust after western women, particularly if they are blonde and blue-eyed. there was a lot of this sort of thing about in the mid-eighties, as this was the period which also saw the awful ben kingsley/ nastassia kinski film ""harem"", about a lascivious middle eastern ruler who kidnaps a young american woman, and the mini-series of the same name which told a virtually identical story with a period setting. the film-makers seem to have realised that their film would not work as a pure comedy, because towards the end it turns into a sort of latter-day ""mr smith goes to washington"". sunny turns from a blonde bimbo into a fount of political wisdom and starts uttering all sorts of platitudes about democracy and the constitution and the citizen's duty to vote and we the people and how the price of liberty is eternal vigilance blah blah blah, but in truth the film is no more successful as a political parable than it is as a comedy.  goldie hawn has made a number of good comedies, such as ""cactus flower"", ""overboard"" and """"housesitter"", but ""protocol"" is not one of them. i have not seen all of her films, but of those i have seen this dire comedy is by far the worst. 3/10",0

"ok, aside from the psychedelic background imagery, the info presented here was good. the music i could have done without (not that it was bad music, just that it didn't fit this film at all).  as for the content of the film, the director brings up the often-lacking pagan perspective on christ's existence and a startling comparison of the deeds and events of christ's life vs. the lives of mythological figures/deities such as mithra and dionyses. then he brings up the chronology of christianity's origins and presents an 'ok' case, but not one that blew me away.  if the director had stuck with the facts and continued on with them, this film would have been good. however, at this point in the film, it disintegrates into a group of personally-gratifying attacks on mel gibson's ""passion of the christ"" and a christian private school which the director attended in his youth. during an interview with his old principal, (which during the course of, it comes to light that the director set up under false pretenses) i felt that the director was acting sort of childish. he was asking good questions but, like the film itself, the interview crumbled into an attack on this particular private school's rules, not christianity.  all in all, if you're just interested in some info, watch the first 30 minutes or so and then shut it off.",0

"as the celebration of christmas has evolved through the years, whether one concentrates on the religious or the secular traditions, it is a time when people are supposed to behave a little better to each other. that has somehow slipped past one ebenezer scrooge, merchant and money lender in 19th century london.  as his nephew points out to his uncle, he doesn't keep christmas in any way because scrooge feels the whole thing is humbug. the humanity in scrooge was driven out long ago, he's a hard case, a whole lot like his 20th century counterpart, mr. potter of bedford falls, new york.  but as charles dickens told this tale, redemption is not too late for any of us and a lonely ghost and three spirits visit scrooge and show him how.  a christmas carol is such a timeless holiday classic that we sometimes forget that it is as much a social commentary of 19th century great britain as oliver twist was. the characters in this film are middle and lower class. the cratchits are a couple of rungs above the street people in oliver twist, but they are having to struggle to stay up there. still love and happiness radiate their home, no thanks to the guy bob cratchit works for.   like george bailey who did a whole lot of good in his life and just had to be reminded how much, ebenezer scrooge needed a wake up call as to the potentiality he still had for doing some good in this old world.  patrick stewart in his live performances and filmed play has pretty much taken over the part of scrooge. but george c. scott captures the old miser pretty well in this film. the meanness of him, but with a trace of sadness that makes us root for him to change. scott joins a fine tradition of people like reginald owen and alastair sim who've both done great interpretations of scrooge.  among the supporting roles i particularly enjoyed david warner as bob cratchit and edward woodward as a hearty and stern spirit of christmas present.   according to imdb this is one of 32 versions of a christmas carol made that they have archived and it is one of the best.",1

"hey arnold! is a slow-paced and slightly boring movie. the plot is not very creative. the paul sorvino character (shenk) is buying all of the decrepit, low-priced buildings in order to build a gigantic mall, shopping complex and office buildings. this plot goes back to many 1960s kids movies. it is boring. paul sorvino is not very exciting either, so the idea of him as the bad guy is not very scary. gramps remembers something about a historical document, and the rest of the movie is about the last 36 hours when arnold and jamal must find the document with the undercover aid of helga, whose father is hoping to become rich thanks to shenk's mall. the kids must move around town on buses, and so the exciting chase scene involving a bus is not only silly, but underscores how this movie is written for very young kids. hey arnold, the tv cartoon is usually very entertaining, and it has enough humor to appeal to adults. the tv cartoon is usually faster paced and more imaginative than this movie. hey arnold the movie, is about five times more sedated, and a good way to put anyone, including kiddies to sleep. hey arnold was a tough one to stay awake all the way until the predictable and totally boring ending. if you want to send your kids to a totally non-offensive movie, this is it. i get the feeling that instead of trying to make a 90 minute movie, the producers started out with a 30 minute tv cartoon script and tried to expand it into 90 minutes. this mall story definitely could have been covered in the tv cartoon. hopefully arnold will bet a better writer if there is ever a sequel.",0

"this film, in my opinion, is, despite it's flaws (which i maintain are *few*), an utter masterpiece and a great and glorious piece of art.  what mr. bakshi has done here is to create an utterly beautiful film and has shown his immense talent and versatility as a director of animated films. he does not receive 1/100th of the credit he deserves for literally saving the art of animation for an adult audience. if it were not for mr. bakshi, i don't believe animation would have survived the disney onslaught. what is more, with the lord of the rings, he has not only created a beautiful animated film, but he has created an entirely new art form - unfortunately one that never quite made it off the ground.  most people will complain about the use of rotoscoping in the film (the use of live action images which are used as background images and often animated over using various techniques from what appears to be small amounts of tinting to full blown animation). but i feel that the people who complain about it simply cannot accept an art form which is out of the norm. no, this is not disney animation. no it's not live action. no, it's not ""cheating"" - what it is is a new, fascinating, and absolutely wonderful art form. something so fresh, and so new that it feels completely at home in such a fantastic tale as ""the lord of the rings"". bakshi's pioneering use of this technique brings the subtleties of middle earth to life is a very dark and mysterious way, in particular, the darker of tolkien's creatures, particularly the nazgul, are realized in a way that traditional animation or live action have not been able to accomplish.  peter s. beagle's screenplay (based very little, as i understand it, on an early draft by chris conkling) is a very loyal adaptation of tolkien's works. where possible he uses dialogue directly out of the novel and it feels at home in the world which bakshi has created. there are many cuts that were made to fit the first book and 3/4 into a single 2 hour 15 minute film, but there are very few changes to the storyline. there are a few holes which it would have been nice to have filled: the reforging of narsil, the gifts of galadriel, the huorns at the battle of the hornburg, but, again, with the time limitations he had (already the longest animated feature in history), these are certainly understandable (though it makes one wonder how they could have been explained in a sequel).  also there is the delightful (one of my favorites) score by leonard rosenman (who also scored barry lyndon and star trek iv (the score for which is clearly based on his lotr work)). it is bombastic and audacious and, dare i say, perfect. it stands on it's own as an orchestral triumph, but when coupled with the images of the film, it enters a whole new world of symphonic perfection. so far from the typical hollywoodland fare that it turns many people off.  the voice actors are wonderful. of particular note is john hurt as aragorn who just oozes the essence of strider.  the character design is also wonderfully unique, though not often to everyone's taste. but remember that it is the duty of the director of an adaptation to show you what he/she imagines, not what you might have imagined, and so aragorn is realized with a distinctive native american feel and boromir appears in viking inspired garb. this is perhaps not what you imagined, but i can only applaud mr. bakshi for showing us what he ""saw"". it also might be noted that he spent a significant amount of time with priscilla tolkien in developing the character outfits for the film.  one farther word - the flight to the ford sequence, in my opinion, is one of the most subtlety beautiful sequences ever to be caught on celluloid. bakshi is not afraid to slow down the pace for a moment, and his mastery is clearly shown by the incredible tension is able to build. bakshi's artistic ability and tolkien's incredible work fuse in this sequence to a glorious peak which has yet to be equaled.  the recent dvd release (2001) by warner brothers, is sorely lacking. while we can offer our eternal thanks that the film is finally available in widescreen format, the package is woefully short of extras. how glorious it would have been to have had a director's commentary, been able to see the 20 minutes of extra footage that were removed for the theatrical release. another delightful addition could have been the assembled the live action footage which was later animated over. also present in the dvd release is the utterly horrible voiceover at the end of the film which is a departure from the simple voiceover which occurred in the very final frames of the film. this version is plastered and poorly rendered right over the musical climax of the score.  of course, the greatest tragedy of all is that the sequel was never made. we will never be able to see bakshi's interpretation of gondor, of shelob, of faramir, of the cracks of doom, of eowyn's battle with the witch king or gandalf's confrontation with him. we will never be graced with bakshi's image of denethor or the palatir or the paths of the dead. it is a shame beyond all shames that we will, in the end, have to accept peter jackson's glitz and glitter hollywood, action film version of these later events in tolkien's masterpiece, but, i suppose even that is better than having no cinematic version at all.  david",1
"as a rule, a full moon production logo is a warning sign to avoid a film. but because i've enjoyed jeffrey combs in other films, i gave it a shot.  it's not bad. not great, but that's something else. the film involves a struggle with a mystic (evil) ""brother"" who wants to dominate the worlds, and the title character. dr. mordrid also has to deal with people, and authorities in the mundane world, which he does successfully.  possible spoilers follow.  dr. mordrid can travel between ""dimensions,"" and does so to find a companion guarding a fortress; however, the guard has been blinded. his eyes are ruined pits. so the wizard passes his hands across the other's eyes, and hey, presto! his eyes have been restored! this sort of healing apparently only works with eyes.  later, mordred and his ""brother"" animate a couple of animal skeletons in a museum to fight. guess which one wins.  however, side from that, the picture isn't at all bad, though much like a comic book. dr. mordred's more ""human"" adventures are okay, and combs plays the role convincingly.  i've seen lots worse.",1

"ahh, talespin! what can i say that hasn't already been said about this great show? nothing! this is without a doubt one of the most well-written shows i've ever encountered, live-action or animation. the newer stuff is way too dumbed down for my tastes, and some of the ""mature"" stuff i have to shoo kids out of the room for. but not talespin.  the stories are engaging and very plausible. some of them could even be stretched out to an hour or two for a movie. episodes like stormy weather and her chance to dream are very dramatic while still being enjoyable for kids and adults alike. then there are the pure comedy episodes such as the bluest of the baloo bloods and stuck on you, where the emphasis is on hilarity. i can laugh myself to tears in a few choice ones.  the drama aspect is very lacking in most shows nowadays(at least, those which aren't specifically geared toward it), especially in cartoons. in the episode stormy weather for instance, kit cloudkicker decides that he's going to join an air circus, but baloo believes that it would be too dangerous. in the biggest fight of the episode, baloo yells at kit to stay away from daring dan, to which kit screams ""no! you can't tell me what to do! your're *not* *my* *dad*!"" and buries his face in his pillow. the next day he leaves for the air circus. this kind of drama is a rarity in a cartoon, and would be most welcome in the ones created nowadays.  the characters have a lot of depth to them. baloo is pretty much the way he is in the jungle book, plus or minus a few degrees of laziness. rebecca is a cunning business woman whose ideas on getting money, while good in theory, are seldom good in practice. molly is a cute little girl, but you can't let that deceive you. she can be a real hellion sometimes. kit cloudkicker is a darker character than the rest. he doesn't trust adults much unless they appeal to him, and he has a tendency to break off relationships. watch his expression in plunder and lightning when he grabs the grappling hook: he looks as though he's prepared to put it right through a pirate.  in the end, it's the drama combined with the very real chemistry between the characters that makes this show #1 in my book. the relationship between baloo and kit is very real, almost father and son. this is demonstrated well in all's whale that ends whale when baloo takes kit's word for it that seymour is abusing the animals in his aquarium instead of siding with the other adults. baloo and becky's relationship is also realistic, due to baloo's motivation for working comes from wanting to buy back the ol' sea duck, not necessarily a desire to help rebecca. but something tells me that if he did get the duck back he'd still do jobs for rebecca.  the sea duck, not to mention all the other planes in the series, is pretty realistically designed. the plane's functions don't change once throughout the series(continuity like that is hard to come by also), and unlike most other ""super-planes"" of other cartoons, it doesn't have one single weapon on board(unless you count mangoes!), and relies instead on it's cunning pilot's great skill to get out of trouble. it's hard to think of a hero vehicle that doesn't have some sort of gun turret, laser cannon, or even a handgun somewhere on board. and the fact that they use their heads to get out of trouble is so hard to find in a cartoon nowadays. plus it's just such a darn cool design!  this is definitely the best cartoon. ever. period. definitely worth all ten stars!",1
"wow baby, this is indeed some fine asian horror/gore, and a crazy outlandish movie. this is a japanese splatterfest that reminded me a little of tetsuo, except in this case with all the blood and guts, there is a bizarre love story. it's hard to imagine how they even dreamed up this visually stunning movie, with some unique alien creatures that infect humans as parasites, turning them into part machine or i guess cyborgs. the only thing wrong with these creatures after they take over a human, is they need to kill each other and eat the other. hmmm, yum yum. this would probably be called industrial splatter or something like that, with a superb soundtrack to add to all the fun. the movie also borrows a little from carpenter's ""the thing"" in creature design and effects. i would put this in the must-have category for gorehounds, as there is non-stop carnage and some very fine gore. and a must-have for stoners, because you don't even need to read the sub-titles, the visual images alone are enough of a mind trip. the design of the little creatures that inhabit the human body like a fetus reminded me a little of frank henenlotter's movies, which is another homage to some excellent gore films with a sense of humour. ""meatball machine"" is great fun for gorehounds, there is no doubt about it, and i simply loved it.",1

"i used to review videos for joe bob briggs' legendary ""we are the weird"" newsletter. i saw a lot of stinkers, but this by far was the worst, and the years have not been kind - it remains the most indecent crime against cinema i have ever witnessed. don't get me wrong - caged terror is nominally more technically competent than, say, monster-a-go-go or the guy from harlem or something of that ilk. what solidifies its claim as worst movie of all time for me is its unique blend of bare proficiency with crippling pretension. is it a vietnam commentary? an ecological protest? an incitement to race riot? a study of man's inhumanity to man? a novel exercise in padding nature footage out to (nearly) feature length? in short: a hep young urban professional (possibly the most loathesome screen character ever) somehow seduces a nubile asian-american associate into camping in the woods with him. after brow-beating her with quasi-philosophical clap for the better part of an hour, they run across two wandering veterans, the unforgettable jarvis (a righteous brother) and the troubadour (guitar-toting manson family reject). hey, a plot twist! tension! action! suspense! well, no, just a climactic getting-locked-in-a-makeshift-wire-chicken-coop-and-lightly-belittled scene. the victim in question stares listlessly at the captors and mutters, ""no... no... please... don't..."" meanwhile, jarvis addresses the troubadour as ""trouby"" once every two minutes, bringing to mind nothing so much as the alien star of juan picquer's pod people. that's about all that happens in caged terror, and such a synopsis perhaps makes it seem almost tolerable. but trust me, i've seen thousands of movies in my life, and this one has remained, for the past eight years since i first saw it, the absolute worst. (i pop it in the old vcr once every two years or so just to reassure myself, and reassure myself i certainly do.) i think the element which makes caged terror so particularly hateful is this: very little happens, and although what little does happen happens quite poorly and quite slowly, what truly makes it compulsively unwatchable is the suffocating sense that the filmmakers really, really want to shove some kind of message down your throat. but because caged terror is so incompetent and ineffectual, what was intended as a civics lesson becomes a crash course in intense viewing discomfort. this film is 75 minutes long and feels like three and a half hours. it's terrible, truly truly terrible. folks, trust me, i saw ghosts that still walk and this one is worse. go see it! you'll thank me. and curse me. just for the record, my favorite line: (in caged terror but perhaps ever) ""yeah, well, you probably think the song of solomon was an allegory for christ's love for the church...!""

"the night listener (2006) **1/2 robin williams, toni collette, bobby cannavale, rory culkin, joe morton, sandra oh, john cullum, lisa emery, becky ann baker. (dir: patrick stettner)   hitchcockian suspenser gives williams a stand-out low-key performance.  what is it about celebrities and fans? what is the near paranoia one associates with the other and why is it almost the norm?   in the latest derange fan scenario, based on true events no less, williams stars as a talk-radio personality named gabriel no one, who reads stories he's penned over the airwaves and has accumulated an interesting fan in the form of a young boy named pete logand (culkin) who has submitted a manuscript about the travails of his troubled youth to no one's editor ashe (morton) who gives it to no one to read for himself.   no one is naturally disturbed but ultimately intrigued about the nightmarish existence of pete being abducted and sexually abused for years until he was finally rescued by a nurse named donna (collette giving an excellent performance) who has adopted the boy but her correspondence with no one reveals that pete is dying from aids. naturally no one wants to meet the fans but is suddenly in doubt to their possibly devious ulterior motives when the seed is planted by his estranged lover jess (cannavale) whose sudden departure from their new york city apartment has no one in an emotional tailspin that has only now grown into a tempest in a teacup when he decides to do some investigating into donna and pete's backgrounds discovering some truths that he didn't anticipate.  written by armistead maupin (who co-wrote the screenplay with his former lover terry anderson and the film's novice director stettner) and based on a true story about a fan's hoax found out has some hitchcockian moments that run on full tilt like any good old fashioned pot-boiler does. it helps that williams gives a stand-out, low-key performance as the conflicted good-hearted personality who genuinely wants to believe that his number one fan is in fact real and does love him (the one thing that has escaped his own reality) and has some unsettling dreadful moments with the creepy collette whose one physical trait i will leave unmentioned but underlines the desperation of her character that can rattle you to the core.  however the film runs out of gas and eventually becomes a bit repetitive and predictable despite a finely directed piece of hoodwink and mystery by stettner, it pays to listen to your own inner voice: be careful of what you hope for.",1

"i rented this film out having heard of the fuss about it not being put up for an academy award, but after watching it, it's easy to see why it didn't. despite the beautiful photography, the film is incredibly slow moving, despite having hardly any plot.  the plot is about a young boy trying to come to terms with his parents' death in what may or may not have been an accident (the film is never clear on this), and how his grandfather used to tell him fairy stories. the fairy stories contain the only bits of interest in the plot, but they're very short, and don't really seem to have any point.   the first fairy story in particular concerns a boy trying to get a magical flower to his dying girlfriend to save her life, but the boy delays by tasting the flower first to make sure it is not poisonous which results in him being a few seconds too late to save his girlfriend - the grandfather then pronounces that the moral is that the boy was too impatient, but that doesn't make any sense because it was overcaution and slowness which resulted in his failure. perfect metaphor for this film really.   the photography of skye is beautiful though, but then stardust which was released this year is another film about fairy stories filmed in skye and beautifully photographed - and it's infinitely better than this one.",0
"in the unlikely case that some aspiring directors are reading these comments, i'd like to offer some advice (free of charge!), from a viewer's perspective. if you want to make a serious exotic adventure film, do it. if you want to make a spoof of exotic adventure films, go ahead. do not try to make both at the same time, it doesn't work. for example, having a goofy ""comic relief"" character killed and beheaded and following it up with a monkey shaking a tree and dropping a coconut on a cannibal's head just makes you look like you had no idea what kind of movie you wanted to make. this one is boring, meandering, cheap, racist....you get the picture. a couple of smart moments and a few glimpses of nudity from kathy shower (way too prissy here) are hardly worth your trouble. there is a reason everyone has forgotten about this film's existence.

"i had high expectations of this movie (the title, translated, is ""how we get rid of the others""). after all, the concept is great: a near future in which the ruling elite has taken the consequence of the right-wing government's constant verbal and legislative persecution of so-called freeloaders and the left wing in general, and decided to just kill off everyone who cannot prove that they're contributing something to the establishment (the establishment being called ""the common good"", but actually meaning the interests of the ruling capitalist ideology).  very cool idea! ideal for biting satire! only, this movie completely blows its chance. the satire comes out only in a few scenes and performances of absurdity, but this satire is not sustained; it is neither sharp nor witty. and for an alleged comedy, the movie has nearly no funny scenes. the comedy, i assume, is supposed to be in the absurdity of the situations, but the situations are largely uncomfortable and over-serious, rather than evoking either laughter or thought.  the script is rife with grave errors in disposition. the action should have focused on the political aspects and how wrong it would be to do such a thing, but instead oodles of time are spent on a young woman who was the one that wrote the new laws for fun, and who's trying to save everybody, by organizing a resistance that ships people to africa. all this is beside the point! a movie like this should not pretend to be so serious! it's a satire! a political statement. but it doesn't even begin to actually address the problem it's supposed to be about. maybe it was afraid of going too far? how cowardly. that's not art. it's not even real satire.  søren pilmark, a very serious and by now one of denmark's absolutely senior actors, was very good. he largely carried what little entertainment value the movie had. everybody else: nothing special (well, perhaps except for lene poulsen, who did supply a convincing performance).  in fact, a problem with most danish movies is that the language never sounds natural. neither the formulation nor the delivery. why is it so difficult to make it sound right? why must it be so stilted and artificial? i hope, when people look at these movies fifty years from now, they don't think that this was how people talked in general danish society.  3 out of 10.",0

"from the moment christopher lee puts on a pair of punk sunglasses and tries to sneak into a punk rock club, you know you've got a stinker on your hands! this film had potential. beneath all of the sludge there are the remnants of what could have been crafted into a decent film, if not an interesting one. the final product is a real mess, however. aside from the gratuitous nudity and some very attractive women, howling ii winds up being a laughable excuse for a horror film. christopher lee gives it a nugget of credibility, but even he cannot raise it above the level of crap.  having never seen any of the other films in this series, this critic will be forced to accept on face value that this is a genuine continuation of the events in part one. we start off at a funeral for one of the characters from the original, and within the first ten minutes we find ourselves in transylvania with a small group of heroes ready to battle a coven of werewolves. the film is paced fairly well, and there are not too many dead spots. the action is there; it just isn't filmed well. one bright spot is the music of a punk band called babel. though their song is played quite often, it is rather catchy.  the problems with this film are great in number. first off, the acting is worse than pitiful. christopher lee is good enough, but that's where it ends. the two leads reb brown and annie mcenroe are lacking in just about everything you'd want for such characters. the writing is wretched, the editing redundant, and the direction amateurish. there are a couple nice special effect gimmicks, but the cheesy ones far out weigh them in number. sybil danning is nice to look at, but her acting performance is less than satisfactory. judd omen looks the part he plays, but his voice and acting are unconvincing to say the least. much of the dialog is in an unintelligible language that may or may not be latin.  i liked the general idea for the story. i always enjoy stories of true believers out to battle seemingly invincible forces of evil. one scene where a small group of good guys are trekking through a dark forest and shooting down a bunch of werewolves is even kind of exciting. kind of. maybe a bigger budget or a better director could have made the rest of the film a bit more compelling. 3 of 10 stars.  the hound.  side note: as of this writing, the censors at youtube.com have still not taken down the ending credits with sybil danning ripping off her top several times while the babel song is playing! catch it while you can!",0

"this a good episode of the new twilight zone that actually includes interesting ideas and clever stories (i note both of them are based on short stories). ""examination day"" is set in the future, year unknown but at a point where they have cake candles that light themselves, huge tv-looking ""phones"" that double as numerous other entertaining machines and distributed only to those of a certain age...and the examination day, a point where 12-year-olds must undergo a government-required iq test. the kid is this story, dickie jordan (david mendenhall) is just celebrating his own 12th birthday and is a smart kid, so is calm, even eager to take the test that he has seen friends pass easily and knows he will excel at based on his school grades. his parents (christopher allport and elizabeth norment), on the other hand, say he shouldn't have used his birthday wish on getting a good score, and while their reason includes that they believe he's capable and he should have no need to worry, it's pretty obvious they are worried. i won't give anything away in the ending, but i will say this - there's a point where we get a glimpse of what's to come as far ass why the test is such a heavy subject: that evening (or another?) his parents ask dickie whether he'd prefer to watch tv all night. by today's standards, we'd be pleased he'd say he'd rather read and not just because there's nothing worth watching...but why would his family ask this? the flavor of what's encouraged and discouraged in the future reminded me a bit of the atmosphere from harrison bergenon (which i hear hasn't received a great adaptation to the screen). i only wish they could've provided an opening and closing narration to make this theme as powerful as the obsolete man was. i found it to be better than the short story it was based on. i haven't read the one that ""a message from charity"" was based on, but would like to since it was interesting - a 16-year-ld boy, peter (robert duncan mcneill) is suffering a fever from unclean water, that has always been common in his massachusetts hometown...but he is able to see through the eyes of a young puritan woman suffering the same type of fever, charity payne, (kerry noonann) who also finds herself able to experience what goes on around him. they both recover, especially since it's common for that to happen in 1985, but the connection doesn't go away. charity is curious about the sights and sounds she records of 1985 and they each enjoy each other's company, especially peter, who has promoted grades in school enough to always have felt isolated from other students, even at the college he's been staying in one place at. things take an unexpected turn, though, when charity reveals some of these experiences to a friend who take her claims that the 13 colonies will breach from england as a sign of bewitchment, added to the fact that she was spared death from the fever (not so common in 1700). the two try to learn a way to save her. the ending is sad but has an interesting final moment that makes it touching. both segments of this episode include a lot of pain but both times, through a lesson/warning that sounds like something rod sterling would've cooked up and entertainment, make cheerful watching as reminders that friendship, love, and wisdom do a great deal. probably 3/4 of this has no theme, but somehow i think it all would have been approved by sterling's crew.",1
"a film that dramatized an understandable reluctance to face the inevitable coming of the the second world war, when a spanish republican, sent by his soon to be overthrown government, (charles boyer) infiltrates himself into england looking for support for his cause by trying to influence wealthy mine owners not to sell coal to the fascists back in spain. he upsets the locals, getting convincingly beaten in one scene, and later in the film facing an angry crowd of miners who see him as yet another threat to their shaky livelihood. notwithstanding socio-economic hierarchy, xenophobia, and world politics, this film expertly delves into a dark and suspenseful intrigue involving unfaithful compatriots played by katina paxinou and peter lorre, and is expertly filmed in numerous darkly lit scenes set in a dreary hotel by james wong howe, and manages more than once to get under your skin.",1
"been lurking for a couple of years or so. i have never been moved to post on here before, so perhaps this movie is worth a star for that, but i doubt it. i just watched it on dvd, having missed it in the movies due to illness and never got around to watching it till now. i had not read extensively about it, certainly not even thought about the movie in some months. it was just what the buddy picked up in the store, so it got watched.  bad mistake.  the shot i spoke of in the the summary up top is in the trailer and on the poster. right from the off, jason statham has hair. like in no other gr movie. or any js movie that i've seen. at least not in the quantities on display here. and ray liotta in underpants should be advance warned. it's scary and funny but not in a ha-ha-humour way. its more in an almost-theoffice-but-slightly-mutated-and-so-failing-sort-of-humour way. they each say the same thing: ""this movie is not like anything you expect this movie to be.""  now, based on previous, extensive, movie-watching experience, i expected this movie to be a few things. like:  () coherent,  () interesting or engaging,  () not a complete and utter farrago of navel-gazing,  () something more substantive than a motley bunch of badly-realised fables from what is just a standard eastern mystic ideology dressed up as a ""cool, modern, self-aware art-form"",  () hopefully better than ""the idiots"".  as you may have guessed by my tone, it thoroughly failed to check any box above. instead it was:  (x) badly edited {pace all over the shop, 70s-amateur high-8 style jump cuts, incomprehensible ""plot"" ""twists!!!"" delivered through hackneyed flash-back montages, i could go on...},  (x) shot as if by a depressed 14yr-old goth who'd just spent the weekend watching truffaut and godard with the drapes drawn  (x) so up its own behind with the whole ""i'm really smart, me"" motif/ message, that it feels determined to repeat it every 20 minutes or so, just to make sure the dumb people (ie: everyone who doesn't like it) in the audience make sure they get the point,  (x) a genuine waste of my time.  as for the undoubted ability of some people to ""get"" something from this, fine. i'm glad you enjoyed it. one poster said something that caught my attention: under-25s probably understood it better because of the editing. maybe, but editing is supposed to make your work more accessible, not less. as for the ""genius is only recognised by the enlightened"" brigade out there, go suck an onion and grow up. there is nothing more presumptuous and self-serving than people who say the reason another person doesn't know great art is because they don't understand the 'craft /materials /moon cycle /filaments of supreme rational thought' which the 'auteur /poet/ artist/ palm reader/ idiot savant' is using to explain his or her 'vision /grand scheme /oneness with gaea /great big bucket of dog-sick'.  for me and many, many more people, its garbage.   movies, art, stories, poetry, anything designed to be viewed by another human is supposed to be engaging and moving. in some direction be it metaphorical, spiritual, emotional or whatever you're having yourself.  the only way this moved me was forward in time, two hours closer to my own inevitable demise. ""the greatest trick he ever pulled was making you believe any part of this movie meant anything at all""  and now, please, by all means, toast my buns for me.",0
"dr. seuss' how the grinch stole christmas / (2000) ** (out of four)  if you desire to see a holiday movie that will inspire your seasonal spirits and continue the traditional dr. seuss classic fable, don't see ""dr. seuss' how the grinch stole christmas."" if you are old enough to read this review, then you are probably too old to get any kind of enjoyment out of this motion picture. it contains lots of colors, creative production design and imaginative set and costume construction, joyous load noises, and the characters are made up to look like the actual inhabitants of the fictional village whoville. unfortunately that is where the movie's positive elements end; the rest of the production is nothing but an excuse for jim carrey to cackle on screen while giving a devilish grin, all while prancing through the overly broad screenplay with nothing much to do.  many people recognize the story of how the grinch stole christmas from whoville, so i will not waste my time in writing a detailed synopsis for you to read. however, i will say that the movie's story is executed in three major acts; the development of the grinch and setting, the whoville festival, and the dr. seuss vision of the mean one robbing the who's from their christmas. there are many familiar names within the credits here, but no familiar faces. like in ""battlefield earth,"" i just do not see why the producers would hire expensive actors just to have their identities shielded by unrecognizable makeup and costumes. regardless, there is snl's molly shannon as betty lou, the wife of bill irwin, the later playing lou lou, the father of little cindy lou, played by taylor momsen. jeffrey tambor is the whoville mayor, anthony hopkins lends his bellowing voice for the film's narrator, and christine baranski is the grinch's lone lost lover.  the filmmakers attempt to bring originality to the story by adding unnecessary subplots and focusing too much on the little cindy lou. the screenplay by jeffrey price and peter s. seaman just feels like it goes everywhere across the movie landscape; there is little if any focus by director ron howard and the screenplay is predictable, too extensive, and contrived. the only character given any distinctions here is the grinch himself, all of the other characters are puppets of the plot, shapeless and uninteresting. and the dialogue is overzealous and too corny to be anything but pathetic. example-grinch: oh, the who-manity!  the movie's redeeming factors go out to the gifted production designer michael corenblith, the costume designer rita ryack, and the ample makeup department. ""how the grinch stole christmas"" is a very good-looking production. the sets and the atmosphere created by the filmmakers are detailed and imaginative; it is like the audience is visiting a world as in a dream. the people of whoville are plastered with makeup, to the point in which we cannot tell the actor reciting the humorless lines. although dazzling, i really can't give credit to the performances, for they are over looked to due the expensive technical department taking their place.  jim carrey is one actor who i can talk about. his performance is what nearly destroys the movie itself he is way too egotistic as the grinch, too exaggerated and comical to allow the story to be anywhere near recognizable as the work of seuss. surprisingly, although there are a few funny moments due to a few slyly clever sequences, no laughs come from jim carry's zany silliness. it is almost like the movie was wrote specifically for carry to overplay his part. this factor only leads the movie to a wild but brainless comedy, which is only a pale shadow of the original christmas classic ""how the grinch stole christmas.""  after this movie, historians should check the coffin of the late author, dr. seuss may have rolled over in his grave.

"there are many problems with mystery men. first of all there are too many different characters for all of them to be given complex or even interesting personalities. the special effects detract from the story and are not really that special. paul reubens is wasted in a pathetic, juvenile role as a character who merely farts and speaks in an inaudible accent.  now onto the decent parts. william h macy, three heavenly words, and his performance as the shoveler is pitch perfect. the sphinx is an exceptionally funny character who is only mysterious and merely spouts out the traditional mystical proverbs. ben stiller is very amusing as well, showing a weak character trying to make it into the big leagues of superheroes. all of the characters do, and that is an area which i found particuarly ironic. that is because all of the actors are indie film actors trying to make it into the big leagues of hollywood.  to be honest, the reason i thought it failed at the box-office is that america doesn't get irony.  all in all i loved the film, but i feel it would have worked better if more effort was put into tweaking the script rather than having unneccesary cgi landscapes and effects.",1
"although super mario 64 isn't like the rest of the games in the series, it is still a classic and is every bit as good as the old games. games with this much replay value are few and far between. plus, this game has so much variety. there are 15 levels each with several different tasks you can do, and many other hidden tasks. the game isn't very challenging, but its lack of challenge doesn't take away from the game at all. once you beat it, you'll want to erase your game and start again. and its just as much fun the second time, or third time, or two hundredth time. a must own for any nintendo 64 owner, and is a reason in itself to own a nintendo 64.",1
"*** warning! spoilers contained herein! ***   this is a semi-autobiographical look at what might happen to madonna if she were ever to be stranded on a deserted island. there's absolutely no challenge to madonna in this role, and it shows. she's just madonna playing madonna, and she can't even get that right. i know what you're saying, you're saying, ""how do you know this is what madonna is really like, you've never met her!"" correct, i haven't, but we all remember ""truth or dare"", don't we? i know kevin costner does.   you would think, in the year 2002, that madonna might have learned something, one way or the other, from the ""crossover"" ladies that have also made their way across the silver screen. for goodness' sake, hasn't madonna seen ""glitter""? mariah carey showed the film world how it is done!!! mariah kicks madonna's trashy butt to the curb in beauty, talent, screen presence, charisma, characterization, you name it! all we see from this glimpse into madonna's world is she's the only one in it.    if there's one thing to be said for madonna, it is that she's consistent. when she was an mtv darling, she set the world of women's fashion back 20 years. now, in film, she has set women's roles in film and society back 20 years, by glamourizing all the most hated, horrible, reprehensible, odious qualities women have been reputed to have locked away inside them, qualities they have been so desperately trying to prove they really don't possess.   ***here's the spoilers!!! don't read any further if you don't want to know...***   here's the one good thing i will say about this film, and i really was impressed by it. they didn't go for the ""hollywood ending"" - madonna's character lives. in the typical, happy hollywood ending, madonna's character would have died on the island, and her long-suffering, oppressed, whipped husband would have been free to finally settle down with a good, decent woman, a woman who would be the exact opposite of his deceased wife, and they both live happily ever after. but in this extremely depressing conclusion, she is rescued, and once more, this poor victim of a husband is once again saddled with his demon of a wife, and his life will once again become a living hell.   *** here endeth the spoilers ***",0
"much has been made of rohmer's use of digital technology to 'fill in' the background. at times it works well, the scene where grace and her maid witness from afar the king's execution is particularly striking. at other times it gives the film a strangely amateurish look, resembling a home video. however, the major failing is that the sheer artificiality of the mise en scene creates an alienating effect in the viewer. we know that what we are watching is not real so how can we feel for the characters? to be frank, i did not care at all what happened to the lady or the duke.  the other major failing, i regret to say, is the performance of lucy russell in the leading role. she is in virtually every scene and the success or otherwise of the film rests on her performance. ok she is speaking a foreign language but she is incapable of expressing real emotion. her emoting in the scene where she recounts to her friend mme de meyler (an excellent performance by the debutante helena dubiel) seeing the head on a pole caused some embarrassed laughter in the audience. also, watch her hands when she is expressing emotion!  all in all a very disappointing film, particularly given the positive reviews on this site.",0

"to call a film about a crippled ghost taking revenge from beyond the grave lame and lifeless would be too ironical but this here is an undeniably undistinguished combination of gaslight (1939 & 1944) via les diaboliques (1954); while still watchable in itself, it's so cliché-ridden as to provoke chuckles instead of the intended chills. however, thanks to the dire straits in which the british film industry found itself in the late 1970s, even a mediocre script such as this one was able to attract 10 star names - cliff robertson (as the conniving husband), jean simmons (in the title role), jenny agutter (as robertson's artist half-sister), simon ward (as the enigmatic chauffeur), ron moody (as an ill-fated doctor), michael jayston (as robertson's business partner), judy geeson (as simmons' best friend and jayston's wife), flora robson (as the housekeeper), david tomlinson (as the notary reading simmons' will) and, most surprisingly perhaps, jack warner (as a gravestone sculptor) - although most of them actually have nothing parts, i'm sorry to say!",0

"life's going not to badly for harry mitchell, he's an ex-air force major (plus nifty little pension i imagine), who's raking in the cash for a patent he's developed (fusing titanium and steel via explosive process, creating super metal fit for nasa), and his wife of twenty-odd years has kept herself in pretty good nick. he's got a nice little pad in la. i like to see visions of the 80s consumer dream, and you get a good slice here, what with the restored silver jag (a series 1 e-type roadster) for him, and the gorgeous antique dolls house for her (as well as i'm sure other trinkets and boys toys). there's always got to be more though hasn't there? so harry let's himself get caught up in some romantic shenanigans (you're only as old as the woman you're feeling). as in many films noir, one mistake, in an otherwise blotch-less life, leads to a downwards arc for harry.  three blackmailers leech onto him. these are where the value are for me, great character actors playing very believable roles. bobby shy (played by clarence williams iii) is a black ex-con who is capable of performing incredible psychopathic acts in order to avoid jail and punish double-crossers. he's reminiscent of pluto, the vicious black ex-con psychopath from carl franklin's well-regarded neo-noir ""one false move"" (1992). there's a similar character motivation i believe. both men have had enough of the man, and well pretty much everyone, in extremis. robert trebor plays leo franks, a fat lily-livered pansy who runs a nudie parlour where gents can photograph nude models at $25 for half an hour, and $50 for a whole hour (did anyone else guffaw at the lack of discount?). he's in over his head, and it's great to watch trebor acting when leo starts to feel the heat, believable breakdown. john glover wins as alan raimy, who is the brains of the plot, an actually brilliant man who becomes a pornographer and turns to a life of crime out of sheer sociopathic ennui. he's a sexual sadist and does a few particularly unpleasant things during the movie, including what i believe is a pretty well-implied rape (pay attention to his rap sheet readout, it's easily missed, and read between the lines for the motel scene with ""slim"").  in common with one false move, though not exclusively, i think the real impact of the movie is in the unusually communicative scenes of violence.  so far so good but i think there's a real problem with the film. harry mitchell is told at one point that he has his ""tit in the wringer"". my problem is that harry mitchell is played by roy scheider. roy scheider protagonists never lose, they're self-sure and smooth, but not in an annoying way. i feel i'm being asked to believe that his character is in peril, the movie relies on this for dramatic tension; however i didn't believe it. for me it's like being asked to believe that sandra bullock's character is going to end up sleeping alone by the end of a romantic drama, or stephen seagal's character is going to get taken down by the baddies (did actually happen in one movie but was done deliberately for shock value). roy scheider doesn't convince as an adulterer either, you don't feel any annoyance with him at all, his character is teflon-coated.  it also felt like a movie that took some cuts. at 110 minutes it still feels underdeveloped: harry's wife, ann margaret, is pretty much a cardboard cutout, an extension of harry, her back story as a politician running for office receives scant attention. the effect that the affair has on harry's marriage isn't properly communicated. this could be a frankenheimer problem, he's not known for character development. i never felt that harry was dealing with little more than an overtly annoying and erroneous tax claim from the irs.   there is good sleazy violent noir content in this film, but i feel that to be in the excellent bracket that the casting of harry could have been done better (no disrespect to the great roy scheider). the film felt short, even with the long running time, and i think could have taken some more fleshing out.  but you really can't forget the sleaze, like the deliciously pervy scene of harry taking photos of doreen in the nudie parlour.",1
"did i step in something or is that bad smell coming from daybreak 1 + 2? god was behind everything? what has god got to do with sci-fi? god is only the answer when you can't think up a sensible explanation for something. in fact, this is exactly the problem with the series finale - they obviously couldn't think up sensible explanations for the multitude of big questions that were raised throughout the series such as how kara thrace come back from the dead in a brand new viper, how her old viper and charred body ended up on earth 2, why baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary baltar in her head, etc. so they explain it with ""angels"" or just don't explain it at all.  the plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to fly a basestar through. for example, why does galactica and its crew go on a suicide mission to rescue one girl (hera), particularly after adama said there was no way he'd attempt a rescue? because they found out the location of the cylon base? that's not a good reason to sacrifice the crew's lives. and how did anders know the location? and what was the point of the flashbacks to the major characters' lives before the war? it's like they forgot to do it earlier so they threw something in at the last moment.  the people who wrote the last two episodes could not have been the same writers who created what has been so far a sensational series. feels like the script writing was take over by evangelical christians on a mission to spread 'the word'. forget trying to tie up the loose ends in the plot, the important message the writers wanted to get across is: don't put your faith in technology as it will lead to your destruction; god is your ultimate salvation (tough luck if you have an illness that needs medical treatment).  imagine in the final movie of the star wars series they tell you there is no ""force""... instead, a jedi actually gets his power from jesus. then they fly their spaceships into the nearest star and go live in the forest with the ewoks. would this be a good ending? no it frakken' wouldn't.",0
"since their nasty divorce from the disney company (with disney keeping the miramax brand) the weinstein company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. the flock is a prime example.  a story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of law and order - svu.  richard gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. claire danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. the cinematography, pacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and i saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. the subject is handled with restraint, but it's still a tough subject and might make you sick.  fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. then came the supreme court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the ""rights"" of sex perverts were opened up and america was turned into a shopper's paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. each such step was met with praise by liberals, who celebrated the warren court's ill deeds with glossy covers on time and newsweek. everyday liberals also praised the court's action and mocked those who disagree. in 2007 how many americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the us post office. just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone's family to shreds.  richard gere is a liberal, but he gives his best in his performance here. perhaps in his maturing age he's gained a measure of wisdom.",1
"like many americans, i was first introduced to the works of hayao miyazaki when i saw ""spirited away."" i fell in love with the film and have seen it many times. now i am on a search to see every film by miyazaki. one of his earlier works is ""castle in the sky."" although it's still enjoyable, it's not as good as ""spirited away"" (though comparing this or any film to his 2002 masterpiece is perhaps unfair).  a young boy named pazu (james van der beek) is working in a mine late one night, when he sees a girl fall slowly from the sky. when she wakes up the next morning, she introduces herself as sheeta (anna paquin). but sheeta has a secret, and before he knows it, pazu is pulled into an adventure that will lead him into danger with pirates, the army and a lost floating city.  going into a film by hayao miyazaki means you can expect one thing: a sense of wonder and magic. many filmmakers have tried, but no one can create a sense of magic and awe like miyazaki. watching a film by miyazaki is like experiencing a fantastic dream from your childhood.  because the film is animated, dubbing the film does not pose much of a problem because it is next to impossible to determine whether or not the lip movements match up to the words. it also helps that the translated dialogue is well-written and voiced by talented actors. the voice acting is varied. james van der beek fares best. he brings an irresistible enthusiasm and excitement to the role of pazu that is perfect for the character. anna paquin is nearly as good as sheeta. she's frightened by the events going on around her, but she knows what she has to do. mark hamill is unrecognizable as the evil muska. he's dangerous and wants something from sheeta, and will do anything to get it. the other voices are bad. cloris leachman is awful as dola. leachman may have won an oscar for ""the last picture show,"" but she's annoying as the pirate leader. leachman gives the character an obnoxious squawk that's nearly always monotonous. it's so bad it nearly ruins the film! jim cummings is an effective voice-over actor, but he's miscast as the general.  i would definitely recommend seeing ""castle in the sky."" i'll probably end up buying it myself. but even though it's not as good as ""spirited away,"" it's still pretty good.",1

"more of a mystery movie with some gratuitous horror elements thrown in; mediocre overall.  it starts with a woman having a nightmare in which her sex partner gets out of bed, goes into the room of her crying child, and kills it. she wakes up. then, that man is dying in a hospital, spitting up blood. his estranged daughter arrives, and he manages to contact her through her dreams (i think), and he wants her to find out who killed him before his body entirely decomposes in its grave.  there's not too much mystery about who did it, or even how; most viewers will have figured that out long before it is revealed. i'm not sure the way he was killed would really have worked.  anyway, the horror elements get in through: a gory autopsy, the recurring dream of the man killing the boy, a nightmare in which a plate of eggs turn into eyes which are then cut, and several shots of the decomposing man both in nightmares and actually in his grave.  i was a little surprised to see a dedication in the end by fulci to clive barker! interesting.",0
"hip. erotic. wickedly sexy ... whatever. it's ""the terminator"" with werewolves.  no, seriously. the cop saves the girl (waitress!) from the big monster and refers to himself as her 'protector'. the lead actor ryan alosio does a pretty good job of emulating kyle reese ... there's a massacre in a police precinct ... the bad guy is muscular with red eyes ... and it even contains dialogue along the lines of ""you said it yourself, he won't ever stop. never."" the dire script comes from a first-time screenwriter who, thank god, hasn't sold anything since this, and it's all thrown together by famously bad director richard friedman.  the movie opens in a strip bar (always a good sign), and a mean-looking biker guy bursts in for no apparent reason, pursued by three cops. one of them is black, and (shock horror!) he's the one who gets killed in the first five minutes. the film goes downhill for the next hour or so, then picks up a little with some decent action sequences, before rounding it all up with an abysmal ending.  for the most part, the cast come across as competent actors doing what they can with a bad script and a director who's willing to settle for less. if nothing else they appear to be learning how to act in this movie and alosio, along with some of the supporting cast, shows signs of talent. darkwolf in his human form is played by gargantuan kane hodder -- famous for his numerous portrayals of jason vorhees in the 'friday the 13th' movies. he's decent enough, especially considering he isn't used to speaking roles.  it's become famous amongst groups of horny teenage boys for the lesbian rooftop scene between andrea bogart and sasha williams, who gets her kit off a couple of times in the grand tradition of former 'power rangers' actresses. and it's unnervingly clear that the editor spent way too much time on that scene ... anyway, the main redeeming feature is that the physical werewolf effects are rather good, and the design of the wolf isn't bad at all.but the cgi is bad. just plain bad. i mean seriously, if you can't reach some level of realism - why bother? just throw a little extra money into the make-up! aside from the terrible script, this movie does have it's moments, many of which are unintentionally funny. it's good for a laugh if you don't have anything better to do, but just don't spend any money on it. please.",0
"jack black's character, tim dingman the ""dreamer"" in envy, finds wealth and success in the idea of a aerosol spray ""vapoorize"" that when sprayed on doggie dung, makes the poo disappear into thin air.   for a moment i was hoping that vapoorize was a real product so that i could spray it on this ""stinker"" of a movie and make it disappear into thin air as well.  although envy is not the worst movie that i have seen in the past 12 months (that honor goes to the cat in the hat), it does get the honor of a close second.  not funny, not sad, not anything. a real ""stinkeroo""!!!!!  a 0.2 out of 10!!",0
"i've been a fan of all things bill maher for 15 years but this film was disappointing and at times disgusting. of course, i am catholic, come from a well-educated family and go to church of my own volition, which probably puts me at ends with quite a few of bill's opinions.  bill's problem is that he presumes that religion is uniformly negative. he's correct to document the sociological aspects of it i.e. one faith builds its holidays on top of another and that many wars have been started because of religion (or, more accurately, by the sinister appeals of men to the ultimate and unquestionable authority of god), but that said he never looks at its positive side. quite frankly, i think that hell would freeze over before bill would ever humble himself and travel to the slums of calcutta where mother theresa spent her life working with the poorest of the poor. she's dead now of course, but he could easily visit the jesuit priest in east la who runs homeboy industries, which works with young men typically with gang and prison backgrounds to teach them career skills, get their tattoos removed, and to become responsible members of society, or he could visit usc's institute for advanced catholic studies, which has brought together some of the world's finest theologians, diplomats, and investment bankers to study ways in which to ethically integrate the world's poorest countries into global capital markets and thereby improve the standard of living for the half of the world's people who live on less than $1 a day. of course he won't do that because that would require him to consider evidence that does not easily fit into his preconceived beliefs about religion, and it's so much easier to continue to make snide, superficial jokes.  that fits into the other large problem with bill's movie, which is that he never subjects himself to anyone either on his level or who is better than he is. in this movie, you have maher the cornell grad spend most of his time talking down to truck drivers at a nondenominational christian truck stop service, in a night club with a dutch guy who smokes pot all the time, with the minister of a storefront church in miami who claims to be the reincarnation of christ, and with an actor playing jesus at a ""holy land"" theme park.  what you won't see in bill's film, beyond some superficial speculation alongside a ph.d in grand central station that religion chemically alters the brain like drugs do and that religion is the fallacy of tradition wrought on the masses, is any sort of serious and questioning interviews with philosophy and theology professors from schools like notre dame, byu, or wheaton college, who could easily rhetorically decapitate him in a debate on the matter. you won't see any serious discussion of any of the writings of c.s. lewis, g.k. chesterton, or any papal encyclicals, and of course you also won't find any discussion whatsoever of any of the non-abrahamic (judaism, christianity, and islam) faiths whatsoever. all you get at the end of the day is a textbook example of a condescending, snobby elitist from the west side of la who makes a movie for his own kind and who has absolutely no gut-level understanding whatsoever of how the other half of america that elected george w. bush (twice) lives their lives or about the school of thought behind it.  i get a lot of what bill's saying, but for someone possessing his intellect and influence, this film was nothing less than pathetic. anyone interested in the kind of intellectual ferment that indie documentaries typically bring could find more stimulation in an old rerun of the teletubbies.",0
"if you're a fan of mystery science theater 3k, attack of the giant leeches, or pinata survival island, this movie might be for you.  i live in nashville and i didn't even know of this movie's existence until the day prior to its release, when the advertising company panicked and blanketed music row with dozens of fliers and billboards. it barely lasted two weeks in theaters anyway.  bad acting, bad writing, and poor production only begin to describe this embarrassment of a film. for starters, the names are a bit much: bo price, angel, and dixie? eesh.  toby's awkwardly slow delivery of lines makes one wonder what production assistant got stuck holding the cue cards off camera. angel's character rapidly transitions from her city-slicker ways to a cowgirl, slipping into southern slang after two days on the ranch. her wardrobe goes from chic to a female version of toby's--in fact, in the final scene, their outfits are identical, making one wonder if the wardrobe assistant called in sick.  the audio is inconsistent - perhaps the most noticeable example is when toby decides to go for a swim and his voice suddenly sounds like he's shouting in a gymnasium.  there's never quite enough explanation or character development to suffice what happens on-screen. overacting, exasperation, grimaces, and moodiness best describes the actors' interpretation and direction of the terrible script.  this movie is best enjoyed after consuming a couple of alcoholic beverages and in the company of your wittiest friends. but that's not saying much.",0
"dream quest was a surprisingly good movie. there were some noticeable goofs, but that can be expected in a movie like this that was made in such a short time. i did not feel any urge to fast forward during the movie and i found it pretty entertaining. it gets kind of silly at times, but overall i recommend it. they probably used up all the glitter in the nearby stores, and some of the costume designs were pretty good.",1
"i chose to see the this film on the day it opened nationally in france, as a personal way for myself to reflect on what had happened a year previous; the collection works as intended: it provokes a whirlwind of thoughts and emotions, working as an intellectual hommage, never stooping to cheap sentimentality nor knee-jerk reactionism.  there have been many allegations made that the film is anti-american: while i cannot speak for everyone in this regard, i am one american who found such statements to be completely untrue. people make much noise about the egyptian segment, by chahine, because it voices perspectives of palestinian suicide bombers asserting that civilians in a democracy are ""fair targets"" for they elect the governments the bombers are seeking to attack, but this ignores much else in the piece: several perspectives are discussed, no one being held up as the truth, and critics--if they even saw the piece--seem to forget the fondness and warm dialogue that takes place between the director and the ghost of the american dialogue, and the director's intense sadness upon hearing of the tragedy.  pretty much all of the films are beautiful, thoughtful & inspiring, in particular the brilliant work by mahkmalbaf, tanovic, loach & inarritu. nair, good as usual, effectively tells a true story of an injustice committed against a muslim family in the wake of anti-islam hysteria that swept--and still sweeps--the states. i did find gitai's piece a bit vulgarly loud and simple in it's critic of media hysteria in the face of terrorism, and penn's piece was too impressionistic and elliptical for my tastes, though i had expected to like it. borgnine is very good and brave in it. spoiler warning: one reviewer below incorrectly read the falling of the towers as being a happy moment for the character; my read is rather that the falling of the towers is what, because light floods his room, keys him into the loss in his life that he refused to recognize. again this is a sort of impressionistic piece, for we know that if the towers were really blocking the light to this man's flat, then there would have been nothing but smoke and ash, not light, flooding through his window.",1
"good lord, what were they thinking??!!!!!! here is your spoiler warning, even though i don't think it'll really matter. you won't be seeing this piece of trash anyway.  a group of handpuppets go chasing after a group of really stupid people, who go on a really stupid hunt for them to try and kill them, and the puppets complicate things by letting them live out their really stupid fantasies. in other words, the whole thing is really stupid.  you know it has to be bad when even mike and the bots can't save something!! and they didn't! i know, some of their lines were funny, like what to add to the sign ""hit"" and the hand comments, but, geez, this was pretty dang sad.  all i can say is do not watch this piece o crud. it is not worth your eyes.",0
"this has got to go down as almost one of the worst movies of all time. awful acting, awful script... and they were the good points! one to definitely miss! the jokes, if you could call them that, were so predictable as to be pathetic. pamela anderson is still relying on her body to detract from the fact that her acting is just as plastic! i sat willing to give it a chance, hoping that it was going to improve which, alas, it didn't! if it was a choice between this and a book, i suggest you settle down for a good read! i like denise richards, which is why i gave this movie a go, but why she has let her self be cast in this movie is beyond me!",0
"while rome goes mad celebrating hitler's visit - uniforms, bands, parades - two outsiders stay home, in a large building, and wind up meeting. she is sofia loren, who is the wife of brutish public servant and mother of six children. he is mastroianni, a radio speaker who's been fired because of his homosexuality. both of them need company and understanding, both f them find it in each other.  the movie covers a span of a few hours. the color are faded and everything takes place with a sound track of military marches and hysterical radio announcers. strangely enough, the nazi anthem - the horst-wessel-lied - ends up becoming a romantic musical theme.  beautiful movie, excellent recreation of a special era in italian history and a touching, sad story. mastroianni is as good as we have come to expect and sofia loren does a superb job, very far away from her usual truck driver's pin-up, neapolitan fishwife personas. don't miss it.",1

"there's nothing worse than renting an asian movie and getting an american movie experience instead.  it's only my opinion, but a good thriller is dependent upon the establishment of likable, intelligent characters. as far as likability is concerned, the protagonists in say yes are a quaint married couple. nicely done. unfortunately, they are stupid beyond belief. let us count the ways they mishandle being terrorized by a stalker.  1. after a hitchhiker threatens to kill you, be sure to tell him what hotel you're staying at when you drop him off.  2. beat the hell out of the stalker in broad daylight and in front of dozens of witnesses, thereby allowing him to press charges of assault.  3. don't bother telling the police about the stalker and simply assume (for no apparently good reason) that the cops were bribed by him.  4. while trying to escape, let your lady out of your sight as much as possible to ensure that the stalker kidnaps her.  5. after getting help from someone to find the stalker after kidnapping your wife, be sure to send them away as soon as possible so you can face him one-on-one. no point in being unfair, right?   now, i'd never expect that any person would be immune to making a few mistakes under these stressful conditions, but the characters in say yes are so dense and make so many unbelievable mistakes that it's effectively impossible for the viewer to care about their safety, since they are victims of their own doing. this kills the enjoyability of the entire film.   in case you were wondering, the scriptwriters didn't stop with dim-witted characters. since they themselves are surely dim-witted for writing this crapfest, they decided to make situations so absurdly unrealistic that all sense of reality goes out the window.  1. the stalker kills a cop inside a police station  while the protagonist is asleep no more than ten feet away.  2. the stalker engages in all sorts of dubious activities in broad daylight and around tons of people, yet no one other than the married couple seems to notice his odd behavior.  3. the stalker survives an absurd amount of violence that would have killed any human being.  4. the ""suspense"" scenes had no imagination whatsoever. in fact, some scenes were direct rip-offs from american movies.  the only positive is the decapitation near the end, which was a pretty brutal scene since it was inflicted upon the wife. it's too bad the filmmakers followed it up with an outrageously stupid ending that comes out of left field.  truly, the koreans behind the making of say yes should be ashamed of themselves. better yet, they should just move to california and take employment with people who make movies with a similar disregard for quality and intelligence.",0
"despite unfortunately thinking itself to be (a) intelligent, (b) important and (c) interesting, fortunately this movie is over mercifully quickly. the script makes little sense, the whole idea of the sado-masochistic relationship between the two main characters is strangely trite, and john lydon shows us all, in the space of one movie, why he should never have let himself out of music. his performance is one-note and irritating.  the only positive thing to be said is that harvey keitel manages to deliver a good turn. his later bad lieutenant would show just how badly good actors can act, but mercifully his performance here is restrained.",0
"after watching the rather sloppy ww1 spy thriller, madam lili (1969)starring julie andrews on tv this afternoon, i suddenly thought i had seen a far superior ww1 spy thriller. all i could remember was that it was produced by dino de laurentis. it only took a short search on imdb to find fraulein doktor. once i recognised the title the memories came flooding back. it is, for its time, a reasonably well crafted story revolving around true events such as the death of kitchener and the german offensives of 1918.it also has a female spy who is much more believable than julie andrews! as with other reviewers the first and strongest memory was of the well produced battle scenes and of men and horses in gas masks. if you have an interest in war films and particularly ww1 it is a film well worth seeing if you have the opportunity.",1
"in a poor village in mexico, the colonel (fernando luján) lives with his asthmatic wife lola (marisa paredes) in an old house. lola still grieves the death of their son augustin some time ago. the colonel has been expecting for his pension of fighter in a war against catholic church for almost twenty-seven years. however, for political reasons, the present government wants to forget this old fight. without having any possession or money, but a valuable gamecock, they struggle to survival with the expectation of the acknowledgement letter from the government, recognizing the law and paying for the delayed pension. this slow and touching movie reflects the social and financial situation of most of the elder retired persons in third world countries. in brazil, most of the retired persons has to survive with about us$ 80,00 per month. the debts of the colonel in the story were made to pay for a graveyard for his son, otherwise he would be buried as an indigent. outstanding performance of the cast, in a very sad story that is reality in the poor countries. my vote is eight.   title (brazil): (`não se escreve ao coronel') (do not write to the colonel)  ",1
"for all of the hype about this film, i kept an open mind as to what i would ultimately think. and, although a bit slow at times, the first 90% of the movie is quite good, with more than a few ""old time"" scares that make one jumpy and unsettled. i actually thought the cinematography was excellent regarding many of these scenes. where dark remains fails, however, is in its climax. the ending of the film and the denouement are what seems to be miles apart from its body. the storyline completely falls on its face with an illogical conclusion and, the answer i was seeking most - what really happened to emma? - was not elucidated upon! the rationale for the negative energy was ludicrous at best, and in the end, i felt very cheated. what could have been a superb horror film was ultimately haunted by a terrible ending.",0
"i've seen this film more than once now, and there's always someone complaining about the ""obvious construction"" of the plot afterwards. but then - this is part of petzold's game: he plays along with the rules of genre.  it's very nice, how the highly improbable story of how the two girls (timoteo/hummer) meet, is again mirrored in another, even more improbable story, that the girls make up for a casting. this film is a journey between fact and fiction, it's more about potentials, things that might have happened in the past or might be happening in the future, than it is about actual ongoings. it's a reverie, sorts of - so apt enough there are a lot of motives, freud might have found interesting for his dream analysis, like all the ""doppelganger""-constellations.   also, i think, ""gespenster"" might be interesting to be watched in comparison to current asian cinema of the uncanny: petzold's everyday urban architecture also feels haunted in an unobtrusive, strangely familiar way. this film is not about the obvious. to describe it as the story of two girls who meet and eventually become friends and lovers, or as the story of an orphaned mother, who searches europe for her lost daughter, clearly doesn't say much about the nature of ""gespenster"" at all.",1
"the king of masks is a beautifully told story that pits the familial gender preference towards males against human preference for love and companionship. set in 1930s china during a time of floods, we meet wang, an elderly street performer whose talents are magical and capture the awe of all who witness him. when a famous operatic performer sees and then befriends wang, he invites wang to join their troupe. however, we learn that wang's family tradition allows him only to pass his secrets to a son. learning that wang is childless, wang is encouraged to find an heir before the magic is lost forever. taking the advice to heart, wang purchases an 8 year old to fulfill his legacy; he would teach his new son, doggie, the ancient art of silk masks. soon, wang discovers a fact about doggie that threatens the rare and dying art.  together, wang and doggie create a bond and experience the range of emotions that invariably accompany it. the story is absorbing. the setting is serene and the costuming simple. summarily, it is an international award winning art film which can't help but to move and inspire.",1

"i caught evening in the cinema with a lady friend. evening is a chick flick with no apologies for being such, but i can say with some relief that it's not so infused with estrogen that it's painful for a red-blooded male to watch. except for a single instance at the very end of the movie, i watched with interest and did not have to turn away or roll my eyes at any self-indulgent melodrama. ladies, for their part, will absolutely love this movie.  ann lord is elderly, bed-ridden and spending her last few days on earth as comfortably as possible in her own home with her two grown daughters at her side. discomfited by the memories of her past, ann suddenly calls out a man's name her daughters have never heard before: harris. while both of her daughters silently contemplate the significance of their mother's strong urge to recall and redress her ill-fated affair with this mysterious man at this of all times, ann lapses back in her head to the fateful day she met harris - and in doing so, lost the youthful optimism for the future that we all inevitably part ways with.  both ann and her two daughters - one married with children, one a serial ""commitophobe"" - struggle with the central question of whether true love really exists, and perhaps more importantly, if true love can endure the test of time. are we all one day fated to realize that love never lasts forever? will we all realize that settling for the imperfect is the only realistic outcome? the subtle fact that the aged ann is still wrestling with an answer to these questions on her deathbed is not lost on her two daughters.  the cinematography for evening is interesting - most of the film is spent in ann's mind as she recalls the past, and for that reason i think the film was shot as if it was all deliberately overexposed, to give everyone an ethereal glow (and thus make it very obvious that all of this is not real, but occurred in the past). claire danes is beautiful (appearing to be really, really tall, though just 5' 5"" in reality), and is absolutely captivating in one climactic scene where her singing talents are finally put to the test.  you can't really talk trash about the cast, which leads off with claire danes and doesn't let up from there: vanessa redgrave, patrick wilson, meryl streep and glenn close fill out the other major and minor roles in the film.  i can't really say anything negative about this film at all, though hugh dancy's struggle to have his character emerge from utter one-dimensionality is in the end a total loss. playing the spoiled, lovable drunk offspring of the obscenely rich who puts up a front of great bravado but is secretly scared stiff of never amounting to anything probably doesn't offer much in the way of character exploration - he had his orders and stuck to them.  in the end, gentlemen, your lady friend will most certainly weep, and while you'll likely not feel nearly as affected, the evening will definitely not be a waste for the time spent watching evening. catch it in theatres or grab it as a rental to trade off for points for when you want to be accompanied to a viewing of die hard 4 or the upcoming rambo flick. it'll be your little secret that this viewing didn't really cost you much at all.",1

"let me be clear. i've used imdb for years. but only today i went through the trouble of registering on the site, just so i could give this movie the lowest possible rating. i've seen hundreds of films, some of them bad, a few awful. never, though, have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence, of high intentions and failure.  mira sorvino is horribly cast as the princess, but entirely unbelievable as phocion, a young boy. fiona shaw is always an entertaining character, but the dialogue in the film is much worse, even, than in the insipid french play that is the source (marivaux never reached hollywood until now, and we should keep it that way).  to illustrate, for example, that leontine is a brilliant, passionate philosopher and scientist, she is shown frantically pouring chemicals from beaker to beaker, shouting out names of famous scientists. and the romance between agis and the princess is played even sillier. for this, the pair should receive a joint 'clair danes' award, which in a just world would be awarded for gratuitously anachronistic and uninspired re-interpretation of interesting teens from literature as brats of the 1990's (see miss danes in les miserables).  aside from the atrocious plot and dialogue, there are some attempts to introduce artistic tropes into the filming. for example, there are moments when a handful of spectators are faded in and out of view of the action, sitting in chairs, watching the principal characters. the director wants us to realize she's adapted a play. i get it. but it doesn't happen at all until far into the film. at that point, seeing a crowd of people sitting in chairs for a moment, then disappearing, is creepy and distracting. they're like some sort of un-scary zombie crowd, appearing through the mists, filling us with dread. when you see the horrible frolic and song that ends this movie, you'll want to rouse your own crowd of zombies and kill them all for the grave injustise of poisoning your mind for 112 minutes.  -matthew mcguire",0
"'the omen 4: the awakening' is a made-for-television sequel to the original 'the omen' film. instead of satan possessing the body of a little boy, he possesses the body of a little girl adopted by rich parents, who is bullied at school and who ends up getting revenge against those who do her wrong. the film seems to struggle with any horror factor, and a lot of the events that happen are simply silly rather than particularly frightening, and it is difficult to believe that this little girl is satan, even with all of the events that surround it. i just did not find this film very suspenseful or frightening, particularly when compared to the original.",0
"unfortunately, this movie is so bad. the original out of towners was manic and very funny, of course they used the script written by neil simon. for some reason neil simons script is not used in this film so it falls flat time and time again. even the audience i was with never laughed. the direction is very slow and tedious and when there is a joke it is given away so the joke dies i.e. the couple having sex in the park. they announce it is a lighting ceremony for new york, well we all know the lights are going to come on and we will be able to see cute and mugging goldie & steve do a bit of slap stick. the whole movie winds up being like this...a joke is set up and given away. why isn't goldies hair ever even messed up in the movie. you will also notice every close up of goldie (they use a very intense soft lens). i suggest you rent the original with jack lemmon and sandy dennis, that's if you want to laugh.",0
"i dunno sometimes...you try and try and try to be charitable towards all the b thru z grade movies out there, but once in a while a particular movie just tests your patience until you want to slap everyone involved. ""bat people"" (which i saw under the title ""it lives by night"") is just such a movie. you can't watch this without thinking that it really should have been an episode on ""night gallery"", and not one of the better ones, either.   the movie has something to do with a doctor who gets bitten by a bat and consequently starts to morph into a were-bat who drinks human blood. (actually, you'd think if he was turning into a real bat, he'd be eating mosquitoes by the gallon bucket, but because this is a cheap, lurid horror movie, blood's the word.) in spite of the fact that he has grand-mal seizures at the drop of a hat, and black-out episodes almost every night, his friend and fellow physician, dr. mustache aspen-extreme, insists that he's just having an 'allergic reaction' to the rabies shots. meanwhile, the world's most obnoxious and stereotyped county sheriff suspects the doc of being responsible for the brutal murder and exsanguination of several local girls (and one wino). also meanwhile, the doctor's wife decides that denial is a river in egypt and alternately patronizes him and nags him to distraction.   it's not so much that the acting is bad - you can tell that the actors are making professional level choices, and are trying to bring some juice and life to the script, even the guy who plays the sheriff. (okay, it is pretty bad, but it's bad in a clichéd, wooden, professional way). it's just that everything about the acting, the way the scenes are paced, the costumes, the dialog, the script and the story line in general sets your teeth on edge and makes you want to, well, slap everyone involved.  i think the movie had an outside chance at being a spooky, unsettling little cult favorite, but:  1)the director needed to beat michael pataki, an experienced character actor, with a chair until pataki agreed to act, and not just channel dennis weaver.   2)he also needed to find a script that made a little more sense with regard to the whole ""bat bites human, who then turns into a bat"" scenario.   3) he also needed the actor who played the doctor to find a little more physically believable bit of stage business for his 'episodes', instead of resorting to ""man has a seizure"" page from the little golden book of clichéd acting mannerisms.   4) he needed to rework the whole 'wife' character, make her both more intelligent, less shrill and waaaaay more observant.   i would never voluntarily watch this film again, except with the help of mike and the bots. it's bad, but it isn't bad in a silly, humorous or interesting way. still better than ""battlefield earth"" or ""waterworld"", though.",0
"""the lady from shanghai"" is well known as one of hollywood's most troubled productions. welles' original cut was taken away by the producers and cut to ribbons. this made the already muddled mystery story even more difficult to keep track of. they post dubbed a good amount of his dialog because of the density of the irish accent, and the dubbing is all too apparent and poorly done. most disastrous of all, welles and his on screen and real life leading lady rita hayworth were falling apart in their relationship, and their tumultuous chemistry comes through on screen.  fortunately, this is all overcome by just how fantastic orson welles' direction is. he makes the film incredibly stylish and atmospheric - every scene just seems to be breathing down your back from the screen. also, the characters and scenes are so bizarre they border on dreamlike and surreal. this sense of weirdness elevates scenes that are often found in these films, such as the courtroom sequences in the middle. i typically find courtroom dramas a bore, but welles' direction and quirky touches make them just as fascinating as everything else. the ending at the carnival reminds one of david lynch almost.  the acting here is also very good. despite their failing relationship, welles and hayworth both give decent performances - their interactions however are just a bit lacking. everyone else is superb and delightful to watch though, especially everett sloane and glenn anders. ""the lady from shanghai"" obviously has its problems, but its worth watching just to see one of cinema's masters at his finest. (8/10)",1

"luise rainer received an oscar for her performance in the good earth. unfortunately, her role required no. she did not say much and looked pale throughout the film. luise's character was a slave then given away to marriage to paul muni's character (he did a fantastic job for his performance). set in ancient asia, both actors were not asian, but were very convincing in their roles. i hope that paul muni received an oscar for his performance, because that is what luise must have gotten her oscar for. she must have been a breakthrough actress, one of the first to method act. this seems like something that hollywood does often. al pacino has played an italian and cuban. i felt luise's performance to be lackluster throughout, and when she died, she did not change in expression from any previous scenes. she stayed the same throughout the film; she only changed her expression or emotion maybe twice. if her brilliant acting was so subtle, i suppose i did not see it.",0
"cutting to the chase: this is one of the most amazing, most intense film i've seen in a long time. the first movie in years that left me absolutely staggered. i could barely feel my way out of the theatre, i was so overwhelmed.  i've been staring at the screen for about fifteen minutes trying to find some way to describe the power of this film, and just failing. highlighting any one aspect of it -- the documentary-style video diary format, the unflinching portrayal of the events, the force of the characters -- just seems to trivialise it all. some may find it laughable that any killer could be characterised as normal. but then not all killers are raving lunatics foaming at the mouth. many are quite regular, unassuming people. they're just wired differently.  and that's perhaps the most chilling thought of all.",1
"this is a funny film. it has all the usual disney components (music, great range of characters, story, appeal), entwined with superb animation and the excellent voice talents of less well known actors as those in say ""antz"" and ""price of egypt"".  the characters work really well, and have a strong appeal, and the humour is aimed at a wide level which overcomes generational barriers. the movie is also presented in superb cinemascope format, which adds to the cinema experience.  call me crazy, but i have seen the film three times, and i intend on taking more friends to see it this weekend. many skeptics have seen this film on my recommendation and not been disappointed. i work in a multiplex, and i can honestly say that no-one has ever walked out of this movie without a sense of satisfaction.  see it, and don't be put off because it is animated. you are sure to enjoy this movie, and make sure you stay for the end credits! the bloopers and out-takes at the end are the funniest part of the film, which is packed with laughs throughout.",1
"the 1930s. classy, elegant adele (marvelously played with dignified resolve by debbie reynolds) and batty, frumpy helen (the magnificent shelley winters going full-tilt wacko with her customary histrionic panache) are the mothers of two killers. they leave their seamy pasts in the midwest behind and move to hollywood to start their own dance school for aspiring kid starlets. adele begins dating dashing millionaire lincoln palmer (the always fine dennis weaver). on the other hand, religious fanatic helen soon sinks into despair and madness.  director curtis (""night tide,"" ""ruby"") harrington, working from a crafty script by henry farrell (who wrote the book ""whatever happened to baby jane?"" was based on and co-wrote the screenplay for ""hush ... hush, sweet charlotte""), adeptly concocts a complex and compelling psychological horror thriller about guilt, fear, repression and religious fervor running dangerously amok. the super cast have a ball with their colorful roles: michael macliammoir as a pompous elocution teacher, agnes moorehead as a stern fire-and-brimstone radio evangelist, yvette vickers as a snippy, overbearing mother of a bratty wannabe child star, logan ramsey as a snoopy detective, and timothy carey as a creepy bum. an elaborate talent recital set piece with pamelyn ferdin (the voice of lucy in the ""peanuts"" tv cartoon specials) serving as emcee and original ""friday the 13th"" victim robbi morgan doing a wickedly bawdy dead-on mae west impression qualifies as a definite highlight. david raskin's spooky score, a fantastic scene with reynolds performing an incredible tango at a posh restaurant, the flavorsome depression-era period atmosphere, lucien ballard's handsome cinematography, and especially the startling macabre ending are all likewise on the money excellent and effective. mgm presents this terrific gem on a nifty dvd doublebill with ""whoever slew auntie roo?;"" both pictures are presented in crisp widescreen transfers along with their theatrical trailers.",1

"bottom of the barrel, unimaginative, and practically unwatchable remake of the road warrior. this film follows the exact plot as the filipino film stryker and is worse by far! bad acting, dialog, effects, dubbing, pacing, action sequences... the list goes on and on. italy made literally dozens of road warrior rip-offs in the early 80's, some good, some bad. this is the worst by far, no contest. not only was the mood of the film completely bleak and miserable, the experience of sitting through this one is a bore and a half. there was 1 (one) good chase sequence towards the beginning of the movie, and a cool shot of a man holding a hand grenade exploding. but everything else about this movie seriously reeks! for actual post-nuke fun, go track down a copy of endgame, after the fall of new york, or escape from the bronx instead. they're much more enjoyable than this rubbish.",0

"felix unger (jack lemmon) has just been dumped by his wife, because he is one of the most annoying , neurotic people in the world. suicide is his way out, but he just can't seem to get it to work, so he heads over to his friends house. oscar madison (walther matthau) is also recently divorced and living it up in bachelor heaven. smoking, gambling, hitting on chicks, eating out and never cleaning is paradise to him. well, with the suicide attempts oscar decides to let felix move in. at first, it is a match made in heaven, felix cooks and cleans and helps oscar pay his alimony on time, but soon oscar is jonesing for women and felix (who in today's world would probably be gay) isn't ready to move on. they invite a couple of british birds over and they find felix so tender that soon they and felix are weeping and chatting about his family life, leaving oscar denied. this is it, he explodes and throws him out, but felix isn't as helpless as it seems, and soon he has the upper hand. my favorite quote ""you leave me little notes on my pillow. told you 158 times i can't stand little notes on my pillow. ""we're all out of cornflakes. f.u."" took me three hours to figure out f.u. was felix ungar!"" based on a neil simon play (who also wrote the screenplay), this has a certain theatre feel to it. set and the repartee and looks feel quite play-like (for better or worse). lemmon and mathau have excellent comedic chemistry and have appeared in the grumpier old men movies and out to sea, reprising the same finicky/slob roles, but with different names (to avoid royalty issues, i'm sure).  this movie is like strawberries dipped in chocolate. the chocolate is smooth, sweet and rich, the strawberry is tart, juicy and bright red (unless you get those nasty greenish ones). they are almost polar opposites, but together, the contrasts highlight each other and make a wonderful dessert. 7/10   http://blog.myspace.com/locoformovies",1
"i should put out an alert all over saying that the movie shouldn't be watched. it fails to a fitting tribute in such a magnificent manner that it is almost an insult to the memory of those brave men. the special effect were horrible, i hadn't expected the total failure on the part of the director to appreciate military technology. how can a machine gun which normally fires at the rate of 600 rounds per minute fire at 1/10th the speed? how can soldiers fall forward when a grenade explodes in front of them? how can people survive when there are artillery shells falling as close as 20 feet away? how come the artillery shells fall only on either side of the road and not the road itself?  not only did this disrespect for the weaponry appall me, it was the cliched situations and the incongruity of the dialogues which had me screaming murder. there were the standard dialogues like ye bhi kisi ka bhai hai, ise laath mat maro and pakistan se jyaada musalmaan to hindustaan me hai and loc cross mat karo ye mera hukum hai. stupid to say the least.  what shobha de had written is true. the director worked without a script and it shows. there is no flow to the movie. there is no gradual progression from one battle to another. it is just one gunfight after the next with no connection to the overall scheme of the war. the explanatory scenes are awful. the chief of army staff looks unconvincing. to make matters worse the theatre people had indiscriminately cut footage to fit the four hour long movie into 3 hours.",0
"...though for a film that seems to be trying to market itself as a horror, there was a distinct lack of blood.  there was also a distinct lack of skilled directing, acting, editing, and script-writing.  jeremy london put in one of most appalling performances i've ever seen - his ""descent into the maelström"" of madness is achingly self-aware and clumsy. oh look at him twitch! oh look at him drink strong spirits! oh look at him raise his brow, and cock his head at a jaunty angle! oh look at his unwashed, greasy dark hair! oh listen to his affectedly husky voice! he must be a tortured artist/writer/genius! oh, yes, out comes the poet-shirt - it's another boy who thinks he's byron. (or poe.) oh for the love of... did someone give this guy a manual on ""how to act good"" or did they just pull him out of a cardboard box somewhere, the defunct little plastic toy-prize in a discontinued brand of bargain-bin cereal. okay, that was a stupid line - but that's only because london's performance has melted my brain with its awfulness.  katherine heigl is cute, and very briar rose, but has yet to grow into her acting shoes in this film - she delivered her lines like she was being held up, in fact, her whole performance was very wooden, her poses as stiff as her lines - who knows, perhaps she was just reacting to, and trying to neutralise, jeremy london's flailing excesses, but if that's the case, she takes it too far.  notable is arie verveen as poe - while his character's role is confused, he delivers the best performance of the piece. he, quite simply, looks right, but it's more than that - he has some sort of depth, i believed that he had a life beyond the dismal two-dimensional quality of the rest of the characters. huh, maybe it's just because i like poe, and could thus just let my mind wander and invent while he was on screen - whatever, he had an interest factor otherwise missing.  the rest of the characters are a faceless blur - there are all the usual caricatures: the perky blonde best-friend who's a bit of a floozy; the smitten local cop who's a bit of a dork; the protective older man who perhaps has too much un-fatherly interest in our heroine; the scheming old witch, etc., etc., yawn, yawn.   as with the 'distinct lack of blood for a horror movie' issue, none of the themes that they mention (and that london's character mentions - so scathingly - in his attack on poe's writing) are followed through on. as another reviewer said - there was potential here: murder, incest, - genuinely shocking stuff, but instead they skirt away from the issues, and cut away from the violence (a raised candlestick swinging through the air - closing in on it's victim - then---cut to black! this is fine in a noirish traditional horror, indeed, it's expected, and is fondly received when it happens - it's a dear convention, especially when accompanied by fake lightning bolts and intense siouxie eye makeup - but in 'descendant' it just comes across as clumsy, or as though the editor got queasy at the last minute and cut it out.) this could have either been a very tense psychological thriller - the horror of palingenesis/delusion/madness - or a simple (and fun) slasher movie: it tries to be both, or neither (something new and exciting!), but either way it fails dismally. the only horror element of this entire movie is it's epic dullness.  i think the editor (if there was one at all) must have been drunk when s/he chopped this thing up - there are awkwardly foreshortened scenes; scenes that appeared to be out of order (but that could have just been the poor script). likewise the director & cinematographer - there were some very strange shots and framing that i think were meant to be tributes to hitchcock or browning, but just ended up looking silly (again, fine in a noir, but this was trying to be something else.)  the whole thing perhaps may have been funny (in that way that previous reviewers have mentioned - ""omg how did this get made?!?"") if i had been in the mood for some trash- bagging, unfortunately for me i had settled on the couch, with the lights down low, with the express intention of scaring myself silly - this is a very poor film, and i'm afraid i can't recommend it to people, not even for laughs.  please, please, don't waste your time or money on this - either borrow a real horror/thriller film, or find yourself a copy of poe's fantastical tales, either way, you'll have a far more enjoyable and frightening night than you could ever hope to achieve with this rubbish.",0
"a noble effort, i guess, but ultimately a poor one. before seeing this film, i felt ""bartleby, the scrivener"" was unfilmable. after seeing it, i still do. unfortunately, i think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on, and they will be upset at the film's needless revisions (updating from 1850 to 1970, moving from new york to london). even the superb talents of paul scofield can't salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film melville's metaphysical classic.",0
"i don't know if i'd consider it a masterpiece of not, but it's damn near close; it's extremely well made, artistic, suspenseful, intricately plotted, thematically challenging and full of bleak foreshadowing and sexual-religious imagery. there's also some great camera-work from jan de bont, an atmospheric score from loek dikker and outstanding acting from jeroen krabbé and renée soutendijk, the latter giving one of the most sneaky, subtle 'femme fatale' performance i've ever seen. like many other european movies, this movie has an unashamed, non-judgmental attitude toward sex, nudity and the complexities of sexuality and has zero reservations about mixing it all up with religious and/or surrealistic (some would say blasphemous) images. in other words, if you can't bear the thought of seeing a lust-driven homosexual envisioning the object of his carnal desire as jesus crucified on the cross before the two of them go at it inside a cemetery crypt then this might not be the movie for you. what surprised me more is how this bizarre movie managed to completely dodge being a pretentious mess. it mixes the abstract/surreal/parallel fantasy-reality scenes and somehow makes it all work. like any good mystery, you can see the pieces slowly falling into place as the movie progresses. there is not an out-of-left-field resolution here. the movie has direction, there's no needless filler and once it concludes, you begin to understand the purpose of what may have confused you earlier. if you like the work of ken russell and david lynch, i can almost guarantee you will love this movie. hell, if you have no idea who they even are, you still might like it.  i'm not going to spoil the plot by getting too detailed, but the film's opening shot - through a web as a spider catches its prey - sets the stage as krabbé, as unshaven, smug, bisexual writer gerard reve (interestingly, also the name of the writer whose novel this is based on) crosses paths with a wealthy, mysterious, sexy woman named christine (soutendijk, melding androgynous stylings with simone simon-like innocence/cuteness that's pretty unnerving), who may be a literal 'black widow' responsible for the deaths of her three previous husbands. the two become lovers and move in with one another, but we're led to believe (through christine's bizarre behavior and the frequent appearances of another woman - played by geert de jong - who may or may not actually exist) something terrible is boiling under the surface. when another of christine's lovers, the young and ""beautiful"" herman (thom hoffman), shows up at the house, things take an unexpected turn. and that's all you need to know.  the 4th man was a huge art-house success in much of the world, but didn't make it over to the us until 1984, where it was awarded the best foreign film of the year from the los angeles film critics association. the most common video is the media release, which has been horribly dubbed. try to avoid that one and head straight for the newer subtitled anchor bay dvd release. since coming to america, verhoeven's career has had its ups and downs. he has made a few decent films (flesh & blood, robocop) and some lousy ones (showgirls). in fact, verhoeven's big hit basic instinct is almost like a less interesting, junior league version of the fourth man. soutendjik also tried her hand at acting in america and since grave secrets (1989) and eve of destruction (1991) were the best offers she was getting, she headed right back home to the netherlands.",1

"a beautiful film, touching profoundly up the simple, yet divine aspects of humanity.   this movie was almost perfect, and seeing as nothing in this world can be truly perfect, that is pretty good. the only minor thing i subjectively object to, is the pacing at some points in the middle of the story. the acting is also very good, and all the actors easily top actors in high-profile films. the actual directing seems to have been well thought through, and the script must have been amazing. there are some truly breathtaking moments of foreshadowing, and a quite gorgeous continuing circular composition of the story.  the moment in the movie, when the main character achieves that feeling of being in heaven is the perfect ending to a truly brilliant yarn.",1

"a top notch columbo from beginning to end. i particularly like the interaction between columbo and the killer, ruth gordon.  as an avid columbo fan, i can't recall another one in which he doesn't set up the killer at the end as he does in other episodes. in this one, as he's trying to determine the correct sequence of the boxes and the ""message"" that the nephew left behind, it finally dawns on him.  the music in this episode is very good as well, as it is in many of other ones.",1
"you can often tell a movie didn't turn out like it should by the heavy use of a narrator. this film features this device throughout. richard jobson not entirely content to write direct and even fund some of this film adds to his credits by reading excerpts of his own semi- autobiographical writing which combined with some pretty editing manages to gloss over what is a dull depressing tale which he must be mistaking for genuine art-house. kevin mckidd puts in a good performance. everyone else is okay.  budget constraints meant that all scenes are shot in daylight though most are obviously meant to be at night, though if you know serious alcoholics they mainly operate in the day so for me it adds a touch of realism.  the funniest part of this film is a waitress who fails to age a single day in the 20 odd years that elapse between her appearances - a more extreme version of the problem mckidd has who goes from 18 to 30 without changing more than his clothes. bless.",0

"say what you will about schmaltz. one beauty of this film is that it is not pro-american. it is a morality about some americans being called to high purpose and how they rose to the occasion. it is inspiring because it is about people of noble purpose.  to me, the most interesting part of the film is the education of fanny and david farrelly (bette davis' mother and brother). as fanny says, ""we've been shaken out of the magnolias.""  in today's political climate where, led by a president who shamelessly lied to us and used 9/11 to bring out the absolute worst characteristics of human beings, we sunk to the level of the 9/11 murderers to seek blood-thirsty vengeance. it can't all be blamed on mr. bush - after all, we allowed him to lead us in that direction and even re-elected him after his lies had been exposed. now, with complete justification, we americans are reviled throughout the world.  today, we watch this film with a new awareness: that the rise to power of nazis in germany was not due to a flaw in the german character, but, a flaw in human beings that allows us to rationalize anything that will justify our committing immoral and heinous acts. i'm not comparing george bush to adolph hitler. but, i am pointing out how a leader can whip us up into a frenzy of terror, hatred, and hyper-nationalism to do despicable things.  sadly, the blackmailer, who will do whatever needs to be done for his own agrandizement, no matter how immoral, is most like the leaders of our country, those who support them, and those who have buried their heads so deep in the sand, that they can't even be bothered to vote.  a film like watch on the rhine reminds us of what we once aspired to be - a force for the betterment of humanity - and that we have it in us to once again aspire to lofty goals.  geoff",1
"this was a pretty good film. i'm not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment, but i didn't want to take a chance. anyway, near the end of the film, the prosecutor reads a scripture verse and then quotes another from memory. i can't remember the first passage he reads, but the second one is genesis 9:6. he says it's genesis 9:12, but he actually quotes verse 6. this is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment. it's too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the bible today. did anybody ever hear of john jay, the first supreme court justice in the history of this country? he said that the bible is the best of all books. too bad we've lost that view in america.",1
"this is one of the funniest movies i have seen. i watched it on dvd, and the disc does not have any special features, or even a menu, but that is not necessarily what i care about.   i tend to judge movies on a case by case basis, depending on, among other things, if it is a big studio production or a smaller film. this is a smaller film and i am willing to forgive minor things. that said, i believe it has one of the most imaginative and original title sequences that i have seen.  i enjoyed the acting of all of the major players. i especially enjoyed til schweiger and alan arkin. alan arkin has most of the funniest lines. the character portrayed by claire forlani might come across as unrealistic to some people, but i have personally known real people with emotional problems that very readily look at life's decisions as her character does. that helped me pick up the nuances where her hurts could come out through the veneer of her humor.  this is not a movie for children, obviously, but it does not engage in gratuitous sex and nudity. there is quite a bit of adult language, though, but it can sometimes be very funny. (in particular, alan arkin's character, who can't even swear correctly.)  also watch for the cameos from known character actors.",1
"there are few comedies like this, where almost every line and every character come close to flawless. this is soooo funny!! and it has quite a bit of satire there to. sally field is heading the field of truly outstanding actors and does a good, if not perfect, job with her daytime tv-diva. sometimes her acting is just a little to broad and over the top, but 90 % of the time she is a riot! in the same league is kevin kline, robert downey jr and whoopy goldberg (who unfortunately has too little to do here). downey jr may not convince entirely as a comedian and has not the timing right all the time, but he struggles with his part which is, to be honest, the most ungrateful one. but the shining star here is cathy moriarty as celeste, a true bitch if there ever was one with more than one nasty secret (you will see in the absolutely stunning finale!). sadly elisabeth shue never seems to be quite comfortable in her part. i normally like ms shue, but here she acts as a fish out of water and sometimes seems to be in a different movie. but it is not something damaging and for the most part she is at least adequate. otherwise, brimming with memorable lines and situations, this is a comedy to watch whenever it is on tv or wherever.",1

"no one is a greater fan of geroge macdonald fraser's flashman papers than i am.  i was surprised to see just now that richard lester directed royal flash, since i also see he had made the three/four musketeers with fraser which i though turned out rather well.  not so royal flash.  i was 12 years old when the film was released and could not have been more enthusiastic since i had read all the flashman papers published up to that time, and was intoxicated with a clockwork orange and malcolm macdowel (i still am, but he was never really given a chance after that).  what a disappointment (i saw it once again when i was about 20 on television and it seemed even worse).  none of the sharp dialogue in the books is transfered to the screen. the comedy of flashman's character seemed to me to have been mishandled in about the same way one could imagine a group of high school students trying to parody it would do. the dueling and fencing was awful and undramatic.  looking back with more mature eyes, the film failed completer to exploit the possibilities of direct satire of earlier film versions of the prisoner of zenda.  if you have read the book and not seen the film, i can only say that the film ends with flashman and rudi von starnberg becoming fast friends and playing a game rudi has just invented: russian roulette.  a pathetic betrayal of everything the books are about.  my comments would be more direct if i had seen the film more recently, but i am glad i have not.  if by any chance fraser ever reads this, i can only say i think he is a genius--perhaps the greatest comic novelist of his generation, but, based on my appreciation of that corpus of work, it as hard to believe that he wrote the screenplay of this film, as that he did all those awful roger moore james bond films.",0

"first of all; it's very dilettantish to try describe way of history only from positions of guns, germs and steel. the same tried to do marxists from economical positions.  the reason of western success can't be just dumb luck, the advantages of domesticated plants and animals. we see, that all around the world any advantages and bonuses are complete useless if they aren't wisely managed. in the japan there isn't huge natural resources, but japan is one of the top world economies, the same situation in singapore, but in nigeria, country with rich oil resources, there are only middle-low success. both of this nations had and still have access to western technology and inventions, but why such gap?   in the end of movie daimond declared, that it's very important to understand factors of guns, germs and steel, to understand. maybe the main factor of world's difference is not geography, but people ability to understand and use things? the mental ability to understand. and in this case geography is only subordinated.",0

"this is one of the most atrocious rewrites i've ever viewed. if they want to make a movie with a lousy story, they should refrain from giving it a title of a fine book. there is hardly a relation between wolfe's book and this movie other than the title. i don't mind changes if they help a story flow on screen. at least the changes shouldn't hurt the final product. the last scene in the movie is painfully unconvincing. the actors are miscast. the director and/or screen writer obviously could not decide whether to make a lame comedy or preach an unconvincing sermon.  if you've seen this movie and disliked it, try the book. if you've seen this movie and liked it, read the book.",0
"david chase's ""the sopranos"" is perhaps the most over-praised television show in recent memory. not only is the series devoid of intellect and passion, it's devoid of a soul. as anyone reading likely knows already, james gandolfini *is* tony soprano, a big, fat a**hole of a mob boss with a spoiled b*tch of a wife, and two bratty, sh*t-brained kids living in - you guessed it - the armpit of america (that's new jersey, by the way). not only is tony a womanizing adulterer, he's also an unrepentant murdering scumbag, with a crew of ""saturday night live"" skit-worthy caricatures for subordinates. it's not the fact that tony is a piece of sh*t mobster that offends me (and apparently only me). allowing characters to be who and what they are, without judgment, is something american tv hardly allows. but chase - and his entourage of money-gorged, emmy-gored writers - have not simply allowed us to observe tony and his crew as they behave, nor have they even attempted to provide any insight into the action / reaction reality of (even obviously fictionalized) organized crime (a la ""the godfather""). instead, chase glorifies and endorses his characters' greedy, violent, and corrupt lifestyle in the same way that tony, his wife, and even his hair-brained psychologist do week after week (or should i say month after month. or is it year after year? it seems like the show's paltry 13-episode seasons come out with the same regularity as a lunar eclipse). much has been made of the series' refusal to adhere to ""network"" structure, with plot lines that go nowhere, and characters that pop-up and disappear like backyard vermin. but if the show is so brilliant in its lack of structure, why does it always feel like i'm watching a soap-opera? tired mob clichés, bored housewives, self-serving, irredeemable characters and plots that go nowhere. more than ever, i can see why so many americans of italian heritage are p*ssed at this show. it's enough to make you want to curl up with a good book (danté's ""inferno"" springs to mind).  people on imdb love to claim that there's nothing good on television, and therefore ""the sopranos"" is a breath of fresh air. are these same people too busy paying their cable bills to watch ""the shield""? (it's included in basic, ya know). how about the (still good) ""the west wing""? or the brilliantly acted (if erratically written) ""boston legal""? what about possibly the best comedy of the last few decades, ""arrested development""? and lest we forget that we live in an age of dvds - nobody *has* to watch *anything* new. i'd much rather shell out $40 for an over-priced boxed set of, well, pretty much *anything*, than give hbo $10 a month (or $80 a dvd set!) to continue to prove how much of a hack-factory it can be.  you want good television? watch ""homicide: life on the street."" or ""murder one"". or ""picket fences"". or even chase's prior show, ""northern exposure."" if you're already among ""the sopranos""'s legion of brain-washed fans and critics, it's too late for you. but if not, leave tony and his worthless kin where they all belong - rotting with the fishes.

"the first time i watched cold case was after it had run for about a year on danish television. at the time it came to the tv it nearly drowned in 4 or 5 other american crime shows aired roughly the same time.  i saw it and i was bored to death. the substandard actors with the self righteous faces and morals were a pain in the behind. the entire premise that so much money was given a team of investigators to solve murders dating back 10-20-30 or even 60 years seems so unlikely.  the time is also a factor as they only have 50-60 min to tell the story which means that they get a break through just in the nick of time to solve the case and bring justice to surviving family members, if they are still alive. this combined with the ""personal"" problems and relations of the investigators which there has to be time for leaves the show a complete lackluster.  i give it a 2-star rating because of the music i the end which is really the only reason for watching it....which you then of course won't do as that is too lame a reason for watching this crap.",0

"as a big fan of gorilla movies in general, i anticipated that this one would be great - and as for the gorilla effects, they were quite good, however - that is the only thing i can write about this flop. the film claims to be based on a true story but in effect, it does not even come close to what actually happened to ""buddy"" - who in real life, was the famous gargantua, sold to ringling bros. by our supposed ""heroic"" gertrude lintz, known by many animal enthusiasts as a woman who hardly had her animals' welfare in the best interest. as far as buddy being portrayed as becoming aggressive, this was total fiction and at no time did the gorilla, in real life, resort to such behavior. buddy did, in fact, escape his wooden crate (not a plush cage room as depicted in movie) during a storm, to seek shelter and comfort in the house, which frightened gertrude lintz into selling him. no, buddy was not released into a gorilla family surrounded by lush trees in a zoological paradise - he was abandoned in a wooden crate, deep in the back of a garage for some time with only a single light bulb for comfort and then sold to the circus - where he actually lived a better life having peanuts thrown at him until he died (historically the oldest living gorilla on record, by the way) before a show in miami. notice also, in the film, how buddy grows older but the chimpanzees never age. (the chimps, by the way, were not raised simultaneously with other animals, including buddy, as portrayed in the film)",0

"the dinner party could quite possibly be in my opinion the greatest adult cinema production of all time. it is produced in such an exquisite manner and the actors portray their roles excellently. the kitchen scene starring yvonne and juli ashton is magnificent. the use of the butter and milk really makes the scene. additionally, the doctor's office scene is well done. the campfire scene is filled with enjoyable action, though the choice of actors in this scene is questionable. asia carrera's performance in the junkyard scene is incredible, but who would expect anything less from her. the closing scene is somewhat over used in adult films, but is classic none the less. i would highly recommend this film to all fans of adult films and those casual viewers. run out to your video store and pick it up today.",1

"oh the hilarity! oh the joy! another film that is so bad it's good! or, so i thought. in actual fact, this one misses the ""so bad its good"" phase and goes, sadly, straight to the ""could have been so bad its good, but they screwed it up and made it plain bad"".  for a start its way too long. cut half an hour and it might have been more endurable. then put in such ludicrous plots as ""the man who is sabotaging the mission to save the earth, because he has all the food stockpiled and he'll be rich if the mission fails!"". duh!. or the ""talking bomb"" plot device last seen in dark star. guess what....just like in dark star, the bomb has a malfunction.....hmmmm. add in a dash of ""we can't act our way out of a kindergarten play"" and you have solar crisis in a nutshell.  light relief is to be had in the form of jack palance (or jack pants, as we called him in this flick), whose sole purpose in the film is to drive a kid around the desert and telephone the kid's dad to come pick him up....eventually. between driving and phoning, jack dispenses pointless drivel and leers and cackles a lot, but contributes little to the story, such as it is. in short, he's the best bit of the movie.  my award for ""the most ironic line delivered straight-faced"" goes to charlton heston, who, when meeting his eldest son for the first time in ages, comments that his son looks a little ""out of shape"" whilst he himself is standing there with his gut bulging over his waistband and in dire need of a captain kirk corset.  also amusing is the bad guy's top henchman, who has a bright white hairstyle that kept making me think of andy warhol, for some reason.  apart from these hilarities, there's little to recommend this movie. the ending is a sequence copied from (but mercifully shorter than) the end sequence from 2001.  tips for enjoying this movie more, if you are foolish enough to watch it, like i did:  1. any time the bomb speaks, imagine it's called tarquin (trust me, it works!)  2. whenever chuck heston is on screen and about to speak, pre-empt him by reciting a line from planet of the apes such as ""get your filthy paws off me!"" or similar.  3. whenever the female lead is looking stressed (this is most of the time) keep hoping against hope that she's having an aneurism and will die soon.  4. during the interminable ""the ship's broke again"" scenes, keep hoping the tech/engineer guys will spout a scotty-ism like ""you cannae change the laws of physics!"" or some such crap.  other than that, do what it takes to get you through this one. i dozed off half way through and woke to realise i hadn't missed anything, nor had the plot (laughable though it is) advanced any. so don't worry about tuning out for a few, you won't miss anything.",0

"both robert duvall and glenn close played their roles with such believability, i simply cried. glenn close's role as ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. ""let him think about what he did,"" robert duvall's character, joe, said staunchly. the story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called ""the stone boy,"" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. then towards the end when jason presson's character, arnold, let it all out to a stranger, i was so broken hearted for him, that i actually thought of some of the terrible things that i did in my life. i personalized and identified with his character. frederick forrest's and gail youngs' roles, did not add not much to the film. i thought of frederick forrest, who played ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. his wife, lou, played by gail youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. i could not really feel sorry for these two. though lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. both did not deal with their problems effectively. they really did nothing for the film and were totally ridiculous. wilfred brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed arnold any attention. i felt his role should have been elaborated. the players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. however, i really liked the ending so much, i actually smiled and cried tears of joy. i felt good. the hillermans were a family again. i actually wanted to be a part of this family. they were so realistic.",1
"the best part of an american in paris is the lengthy ballet sequence at the end, where gene kelly and leslie caron are the living personification of several major painters. kelly has earlier been established as a pavement artist in paris, so the sequence is the logical ending to a musical bursting with life and energy, gershwin tunes, and cast members like georges guetary and oscar levant. kelly was at his best here - it's a little different to singin' in the rain, and the effect of all the film as one topped with the ballet gives it a definite wow factor. no wonder the sequence ended 'that's entertainment' after all other mgm musical highlights had gone by!",1
"this is bar none the most hilarious movie i have ever seen. beginning with the four delinquents being sent off by their fathers to wienberg military academy, a tone is set that steadily continues all throughout this goofball film, and it does not let up for a second.  it's tough trying to describe this film; the humor elements are so spot on and brilliantly concieved that upon a first look it appears as nothing more than a stupid 80's teen lust comedy. but it is oh so much more than that! fresh from the minds of those folks over at mad magazine, up the academy serves up a formula and style that i have never since seen duplicated by any of the ""funniest"" offerings to come out of hollywood in years past. basically the film is so full of infantile cornball material that you might guess that the writers were a couple of 14 year olds themselves. see this movie if you love to act ""immature."" a classic. *****",1
this is a pretty well known one so i won't get too deep into it. the basic story is about two teens who find out about a slimy alien blob of goo that arrives to earth via meteor. human contact with this slime ball burns through flesh like acid. it also absorbs human bodies making it grow bigger. nobody believes the teens (steeve mcqueen and his girlfriend) and when they finally do it seems that the blob can't be stopped. it's really well done for it's age and unlike a lot of other 50's flicks the pace is pretty fast. the story is very unique making it and a must see for any fan of old sci-fi and monster movies. if you can dig the gooey gore of 80s horror be sure to check out the remake from '88 as well.,1
wonderfully put together..i wish there was a follow up to this documentary to follow up with the lives of some and celebrate the lives of others lost...there should be a part two..a real one. it was great..the film wasn't long enough..i would like to know why the creator of the film did not follow up!! this is so important to the community period..well if your are reading this please consider doing another documentary of this sort...i am really tired of hearing from naive writers how aids and men go together when they don't; actually its the hetero's that we need to look into..this film didn't even bother to mention hiv or aids and i was so glad for that..i really appreciated the break downs and definitions too. thank you s much for allowing this film to exist.,1
"the first episode set the bar quite high i thought. it starred william hurt as a hit-man who is contracted to kill a toymaker. we are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill, indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all. returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers, this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business. but he is in for a night of hell, the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war, driving jeeps, shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters!. the special effects are good for a tv show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive, sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not. i wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist. this gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment, the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one. stephen king adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception",0

"four tales of terror regarding the events at a creepy old mansion are recounted to sceptical scotland yard investigator holloway (john bennett) as he investigates the whereabouts of the latest occupant of the house that dripped blood.  one can only struggle to find the words to describe the true brilliance that is the house that dripped blood'. this seventies horror anthology is quite remarkable in the way that such a visually innocent movie is capable of inducing horror in even the most discerning of viewers. incredibly, the number of depictions of violence on-screen can be counted on one hand but the film is still able to portray brutality and succeeds in conjuring up the most horrific images in the viewers own imagination, all the while refraining from taking the obvious route of graphic violence. in a rare feature of early seventies horror the technicalities of the movie are virtually flawless, from the faultless performances of the star-studded cast (featuring the legendary peter cushing, christopher lee and ingrid pitt) all the way to the superb direction and story telling courtesy of peter duffell and master of the macabre writer robert bloch (the author of the novel psycho'). the only real complaints that one may have with the house that dripped blood' are the somewhat asinine plot-twists at the end of the first two segments and the predictable ending of the picture, but even these minor details fail to detract from the overall viewing enjoyment.  the first segment, entitled method for murder', tells the story of charles hillyer (denholm elliott), a horror author who rents the creepy house while he works on his latest novel. while working on the novel, hillyer continues to start seeing the murderous character from his story in and around the house and soon begins to question the difference between fiction and reality. elliott's performance in this piece is truly exceptional and his character is given a surprising air of believability. the key to this segment, as with the others, is the mystery surrounding the events that take place. the viewer is made to question whether the sight of the murderous character of dominic is merely a hallucination, a schizophrenic disorder or whether the character is actually there. duffell's direction succeeds in creating an unsettling atmosphere coupled with a slow, methodical approach to engendering the tension and suspense required to make the segment greatly enthralling.  the following segment features peter cushing as the new occupant of the sinister house. during a trip into town he comes across a wax museum of horrors and decides to venture in. while there, he discovers a wax model of a beautiful woman that seems all too familiar to him. cushing's character (philip) is then joined by his friend neville (joss ackland) who also wishes to visit the museum, much to the dismay of philip. in this segment the viewer is given no more than very subtle clues as to the mystery of the wax woman but in general the viewer is left in the dark. there is far less tension to this particular story yet the segment still succeeds in maintaining its air of mystery through a particularly harrowing dream sequence and the general ambiguity of the story. duffell's direction is once again exceptional and while this is quite possibly the weakest of the four stories, there is no denying that through some creative direction and credible acting waxworks' is still a delightful entry into the film.  waxworks' is followed by what is, in my opinion, the greatest of the four segments  sweets to the sweet'. christopher lee stars as john reid, the father to a young girl who to begin with has an inexplicable fear of fire which is soon remedied by caring nanny ann norton (nyree dawn porter). however, john appears to be harbouring a dark secret about the family. sweets to the sweet' is easily the most sober and intricate of the four stories and that is why the segment is undeniably compelling to the viewer. throughout the segment small and subtle clues are released about the truth behind the family, but it is not until the immensely horrific final scene that everything slots neatly into place. this is the best example of how duffell used dramatic tension and suspense to create the foreboding atmosphere that made the entire film great. accompanied by a wonderfully arranged soundtrack, sweets to the sweet' is an exercise in sustained fear that grabs the viewer by the throat and refuses to let go until the agonising screams that end this piece finally cease. personally, i believe that this short segment would have made an entertaining and haunting feature length movie and i would give this segment a rare 10/10.  the film is ended with the story surrounding the missing performer that the investigator was originally interested in. jon pertwee and ingrid pitt star as two performers who are currently working on a horror movie. pertwee's character is disgusted with the amateurish production and props of the film and so he purchases his own vampire cloak from a strange shop of mysteries. however, strange things begin to happen when he wears the cloak and soon he begins to fear the worst. this segment, which places the inspector amongst the events, is a nice way to wrap up a wonderful anthology. although there is an irrefutable air of camp to the segment this is, in a way, what makes the story so enjoyable. unfortunately, there is little in this segment that could be classed as frightening in any sense and the predictable ending could have been executed better but nonetheless the segment has its redeeming features. horror buffs should definitely look out for pertwee's brief comment on bela lugosi's and christopher lee's portrayal of dracula. this slightly comical and light-hearted approach to the final segment is in essence an adequate and almost natural way of ending the picture even if it lets down the film when compared to the earlier examples of suspense-driven horror.  to sum up, the house that dripped blood' is one of the greatest horror anthologies that features an incredible cast, great stories and above par direction. there are certainly worse ways to spend one hundred minutes of your life and while blood and guts fans will be highly disappointed, fans of more tense horror efforts should enjoy this film immensely. my rating for the house that dripped blood'  8/10.",1
"i did not know for some time in my youth all that could in general be known about this film however the ways of making a film was not what in fact drew my attention, what made this motion picture one the most liked films even to this very day that i have ever seen was of the heroism,bravery and the honor to have served in her majestys service.this film is not always what it seems and that is perhaps as it should be,however i cant say enough for the courage exhibited by sgt.cutter in defense of the uniform that he too would of sacrificed his life to save from peril of the sort that they and the troop were threatened with the emergence of this thugee group.  to be certain sgt. cutter is the kind of individual you might suggest something about and then you watch this unequivocal belief not only in each other but in her majesty the queen of england.i think for all of his lust for money and the such that that character was great.a reckless brave courageous soldier who did not know fear.i think grant was excellent in this role,truly a very capable rendering made compelling by the uniform that he wore.i never felt ballantine was a shoe-in ,in fact there was so much confidence in there assumptions that you might be well not to look to close because it is still only a picture.what do i mean?this picture is still only a motion picture and like the times in which these events take place as well as when the picture was actually made provide a look at how things were done then and what or why there are so many different opinions as to this motion picture will distract your attention.both ballantine and machesney are equal in there dedication with both men from time to time providing a unflinching daring as to there jobs as men in the service of her majesty.these three seem to bring things off rather well and i believe it is a useful,even enjoyable interlude when ballantine has a date with destiny or so it would seem only to have fate as you would have it intervene.is it believable?i don't know.i think it is very fitting when the company having escaped the clutches of death in tantrapur and they are dragging there tails as they are approaching the main gates to the regiments post when ballantine allows the other two to know that he is leaving the service,and getting married and going into the tea business.machesney says he could sign up for another 9 years.it will make a man out of him.i like that sentiment.  i don't think there is any doubt as to just what it means to have brave dependable courageous soldiers representing your very best interests.where does this end,in fact it may never end.those interests are so well placed as to what is important in this world that i enjoy this picture today as much as perhaps i enjoyed the picture when i was ten years old.i had never known about the truthfulness of this film up to recently when i went into history and found the information about kali.there is quite a good deal to learn however once all is said and done about the historical significance of the goddess of kali,this motion picture takes on a quality that i refer to as intelligence.this is a very honest attempt to convey a belief in what is being attempted.i think this is an excellent film.george stevens directed.  there is a few items to be aware of i don't think all the information will jive with history however when the journalist is addressed as mr.kipling things can get very emotional because all the rest are characters but this is rudyard kipling?george stevens went over the top to convey a time and a time before when these events actually occurred.the information is honest,compelling and it will not only draw you in but you will need to understand about why we so love gunga din.there is in the distance the black watch is out in front and they are approaching a most certain peril and possible defeat unless the troop can be warned.sgt.cutter is seriously wounded and ballantine as well as machesney are restrained.din having a deep wound at the base of his back as the result of a bayonet thrust deeply into his body from behind is up to the demand of having to warn the colonel of impending peril.with a effort worthy of our most sincerest desires in this life time din slowly climbs and manages to scale the steeple which rests as the top of the tuggee temple.the sound of gunga dins horn allows the approaching army to be forewarned.a very large scale battle ensues and the enemy is nullified.it is so dramatic and tense filled position that as gunga din lay dead on a pile of rocks which his bullet riddled body now shows,sgt.cutter says good work soldier.i don't know of any more dramatic moment nor one where we learn what sacrifice means then when the troop is forewarned of the impending peril.  the end is far from being anti-climatic,it is the telling of who gunga din is and what he means now to the honored men in uniform for whom he willing sacrificed.ballantine knows his heart and asks the colonel to take care of his enlistment papers and this makes machesney quite pleased with the colonel being honest places the enlistment papers in his pocket to be dealt with at perhaps at a more appropriate time.the colonel says at the place where now all are gathered that we have all done enough soldiering for one long day and further comments on how pleased there efforts were in defense.machesney says he would rather here that from the colonel than get a bloomin medal.this is a very sober point and then he comes to din.now here is a man who has no actually status so i am going to appoint him a corporal and his name shall be written on the rolls of our honored dead.the poem is read as though it was just penned by kipling himself who stands by the gravesite with the colonel and the rest of the men.gunga din bravo!",1
"this movie had no parts that were hilarious, mostly just average funny units, but it did not have any parts that were really bad either. the worst part was the voice of sid. his slothy slur was just too much for me. by about 5 minutes in i was sick of hearing him talk. aside from the annoying sloth voice the movie was good. there were numerous side jokes which if you catch them make the movie much better. this is a good movie for kids. it has enough in it to keep adults content and enough in it to entertain kids. this one is definitely worth renting if you have kids and want to watch a movie with them.",1
"this is not as funny and gory as the dvd box claims. i really love twisted and wierd movies, but this one is really just dull! it's one hour of ripped off penises, flying baby born dolls and a lot of rape! i think the intention with this amateur sleaze, was to make a it's-so-bad-it's-good movies, but it fails. it's just bad! a few scenes are ok, but in whole it's a mess. if you like amateur splatter like this one (only way better) i would recommend andreas schnass' violent shit 2 and 3.",0

"easily the best known of all the shakespeare plays, it has been seriously let down here. shoddy direction, stagnant studio work and erratic performances spoil a fine tragedy.  in the town of verona, the capulets and the montagues have been feuding for centuries but tragedy is imminent when romeo (patrick rycart), a montague, falls in love with juliet (rebecca saire), a capulet. bloodshed soon erupts...  the studio work, especially in daytime scenes, seriously stagnates the energy of the play. it's a story that, with it's energy, deserves to be shot outdoors. coupled with this the costumes are hideous, with too many tights and ludicrous codpieces. the stage fighting looks horrendous, with far too much stretching and running around to be engaging.  patrick ryecart is too lightweight to be a truly effective romeo. he manages the character's intensity when the plot gets going but his stately accent and bland, often inexpressive eyes limit his range. it is very hard for the audience to relate to this romeo. rebecca saire is too youthful to be a good juliet - she captures the character's naiveté but a little more sassiness would have been welcome.  the supporting roles don't fare much better. joseph o'connor's friar laurence is fine but too many of his best lines have been cut. anthony andrews' mercutio belongs on stage and not on camera. he gurns and gesticulates excessively and looks rather ridiculous as a result. alan rickman, underplaying his role, has virtually no presence as tybalt. he did develop an edge and intensity to deliver some fine screen performances in later years, but that isn't in evidence here. the prince can be a fine role with his brief appearances but actor lawrence naismith fails to give the part any authority on camera. only micheal hordern, in probably his best role in this series, comes out of this with any dignity. his capulet is well-played and a joy to watch.  see one of the other versions of this story instead.",0
"look,i'm reading and reading this comments and there's a lot of it that i wanna say but i will try to make it short but clean...  first of all, lets forget all of the things how bad this movie was made...how it didn't show anything of notorious and i agree with the most people here saying that it was ""hollywood"", i mean, what did you expect a real life story? when will people wake up and see that u will never ever find the real truth about 2pac and biggie... its all covered up and buried deep down.  second, i'm not against neither 2pac or biggie i love them both but 2pac and lil kim did get embarrassed in this movie for sure...  next, for all of ya that are saying that the movie is awesome and cant see the truth, either u are too blind too see it because u think u know something about big or you don't know anything about him at all and u love this hollywood teenage movies. use your mind and see though the clouds... there is a lot of it you could say when it gets to this topic, i did not say 60% of what i have to say because its a very wide topic but for the movie i can only say that it could have been a little bit, i mean a much better done. but anyways i'm just some person giving her opinion....no hard feelings...  look, i love hip hop and i live for it but after seeing this movie every person with a little intelligence could see that this is not how someone is suppose to live. with all do respect for 2pac and big, like all the other artists who are making for a living like this should turn the other page because u are ruining the youth....bringing the wrong message to the children and that is: not going to school but living from the streets, hustling and just grabbing for the paper....  the true hip hop is suppose to be about love and intelligence, be smart and all.  ok i know that many of you will think that i'm crazy, but this is just my point of view. look i am maybe wrong about something and im not saying this is a completely bad movie because even if i'm in hip hop for 17, 18 years i still don't know anything bout 2pac or biggie no matter how many articles i read or how much i support them and listen to their music...like most of you all out there. only people who were really close to them and the killers know the truth behind all this.  and for the end i just wanna say for all of ya biggie and tupac fans and family, this two men were and will be the greatest of all time, no matter how they lived their lives but please in the future try to be better, learn and love each other, think good even for the ones that don't like you, because at the end...its not about how many money or fame u could get and how fast u could get to the top, its about accomplishing your self to the fullest and feeding your soul, your body and mind...because if u manage to do that, you will be living a life even after death!!!! peace and love to ya all!!!! rip biggie,2pac,aaliyah,left eye,jam master jay and the others who make a change in this world!!!!",0
"far from providing the caffeine kick you'd expect from a film that shares its name with the most energy-boosting of warm beverages, coffy clunks about and never really rises above being just a ropey revenge tale. indeed, if the movie was a cup of coffee, it'd be rather weak and watery, littered with a few undesirable dregs and lacking in a lingering aftertaste. sporadically it hits the spot, but otherwise it isn't the hot action-drama it hopes to be.  plot-wise, coffy is a nurse who takes the law into her own hands and delivers hard justice to the drug-pushing, lady-pimpin', mob-suckers that hooked her younger sister into a depraved, sick state. socio-political commentary on the plight of urban black youths in america is prominent in coffy, and it makes for some thought-provoking stuff as coffy crusades against the political corruption and white establishment racism that profits and acts as a parasite off the targeted afro-american minorities. sadly, the timely messages are undermined by the film's poor quality and lack of focus. coffy's ideas are important, it's just that they are not well-aimed.  one of the plus points of coffy is the presence of blaxploitation icon pam grier. grier goes at her role with gusto and makes for an appealing action heroine as she shotguns down the scum in her often spectacular acts of vigilante violence (how do you deal with a house full of hoods? drive the car right through the front door!). it's just a shame that the storyline wavers on occasions, wasting time squeezing as much sexual exploitation as possible. the low budget can't have helped, but neither does the fact that for a blaxploitation flick, coffy lacks groove. just as the issues are undermined by the lack of quality, consequently the entertainment and excitement are also skewered by moments of dullness and misdirection.  the total result is workmanlike and wooden. we get a hip heroine but not a hip movie. it's a shame as coffy has its moments and should rightly be regarded as a key film in the blaxploitation craze; it just never ascends above being an average, lukewarm number.",0

"same old same old about che. it completely ignored the really interesting facts of che's true character. sodeberg redid the same boring narrative of che. the silly seductive tale of an argentinean rich-boy who was so shocked by poverty he became a robin hood fighting alongside the poor, until eventually he was murdered by the cia. yeah, yeah, heard it all before, boring and untrue!. the reality of che guevara is very different and far more explosive! the facts show that he was a totalitarian with a messiah streak, who openly wanted to impose maoist tyranny on the world. he was so fanatical that at the hottest moment in the cold war, he even begged the soviet union to nuke new york, washington or los angeles and bring about the end of the world. che urged khrushchev to launch a nuclear strike against us cities. for the rest of his life, he declared that if his finger had been on the button, he would have pushed it. when khrushchev backed down and literally saved the world, che was furious at the ""betrayal"". if che's recommendations had been followed, you would not be reading this review now. how a homicidal maniac became a pop icon would have made a much more interesting film. incredible that no filmmaker has been daring enough to show the real side of che and his posthumous media transformation. that would make an oscar winning film! i thought making independent film meant taking real risks and being groundbraking! they only stick to ""safe counterculture themes"", to wit, ""che cool"", ""wall street bad"", ""republican= nazi"", ""bush ex hitler"", ""nra is worse than kgb"", ""christians are fanatics and stupid"", etc...ad nauseum. oooh, how daring, how mind blowing. tres anti-mainstream and edgy. i wish they would have some real cojones and tackle the independent film oligarchy! that would be truly daring!",0
"this is one of the best reunion specials ever, with adam west and burt ward parodying themselves and having fun while doing it. it's amazing the amount of effort that went into the detail, particularly recapturing the feel of the 1960's era, the batcave set, wayne manor, the costumes, and the actors selected to play the younger versions of west, ward, burgess meredith, cesar romero, and frank gorshin! this 90 minutes is well worth your time, and is a delight to all fans of the classic 1960's ""batman"" television series. i note that clips from ""batman"" were from the movie, and not the series itself, probably because of legal restrictions. let's hope the three seasons of the show are forthcoming on dvd.",1
"a young american woman visits her irish roots and fends off a druid witch who is out to possess her. sounds intriguing but after an interesting start, i got lost and spent most of the time wondering where it was going. the movie seems to be dithering in two directions -- are we watching the travails of the irish-american woman battling her alcohol problem or are we watching a straight off horror flick about an evil witch that returns from the past? the director can't seem to decide. the two doesn't seem to gel and in the end you get nowhere. this could be so much better done and the story seemed to drag towards the end. this was most boring and disappointing.",0
"this is a rather tame fluff piece concerning ww ii codes being broken, stolen, etc. the acting is about what i expected from this cast of mgm ""b"" actors.  one big caution. jean rogers, who did such a great job playing the very sexy dale arden in the first two flash gordon serials is just awful in this movie. her character is extremely annoying. she absolutely never lets-up with her overacting. we are supposed to believe that during the height of a world war in what would obviously be a top secret code facility, she would be allowed to just pop in and out of any office of her choosing although she has no official function. from that standpoint i'm sorry that i ever watched this film. it has forever changed my perception of ms. rogers. talentwise, she is an extreme lightweight.  lee bowman is his usual self, meaning that he is merely adequate.

"contrary to some people's summaries, the women depicted in the film are not geisha. they are oiran (prostitutes) living outside the most famous pleasure districts, and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of tokugawa era women. i can't say the stories were particularly enlightening, but their charm lies in just how typical they are. the themes are universal and everyday: love, friendship, and sacrifice.  i did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting. i felt like i was getting a glimpse of a time and place i can never otherwise glimpse. the actors, especially the 4 women who played the main oiran, were a thrill to watch. i'd only recommend this movie to people who want a taste of japanese culture, or to those who enjoy quiet and emotional stories. it's a great example of both.",1
"i watched this movie on the grounds that amber benson rocks and nick stahl is generally pretty cool - i figured that any film featuring two actors i like and respect couldn't be all bad. and in that sense, i was right - considering the cringe-making dialogue they were given, both of them perform reasonably well. not well enough to stop the movie from sucking, you understand, but well enough that i was able to make it through the 75-odd minutes of movie (and that's the main sign of an awful film: when, at 40 minutes through, you're already praying for it to be over).  it's hard to know where to start with the problems in ""taboo"". the dialogue, as mentioned, is appalling; wooden and completely unnatural. january jones' acting is unbelievably bad, and since she's the character we spend most of our time following around the house, this is an unforgivable flaw. the plot manages to be so convoluted that it makes no sense while simultaneously being so clichéd as to be completely predictable (literally, not one of the major 'twists' in this film would surprise anyone but a toddler). a few interesting shots aside, the director tries far too hard with far too little success, awkward tracking shots and jittery camera-work distracting from what little element of story there is.  three of this movie's stars are awarded for the fact that it contains amber benson, and the last is tossed in on the grounds that one of the jokes made me snigger a little bit. i wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, ever, under any circumstances. avoid at all costs.",0
"the next-to-last episode aired of the original star trek series is an interesting, sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season; though flawed, 'all our yesterdays' has its moments and overall a moody, compelling feel to it. kirk, spock, and mccoy beam down to a planet, assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there, since the planet's sun is due to explode within hours. but as it turns out, the people there are all too aware of the planet's fate, and using a kind of time travel device, have escaped into the past. each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a 'library,' run by an elderly man named mr. atoz. atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well, and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers. there is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode, with lines like:  mccoy- where did they go? atoz- wherever they wanted to.  the misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily, but for plot purposes, it isn't, and soon kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th century england, while spock and mccoy are sent to an ice age, 5000 years in the planet's past. from here, the main focus is on spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment. spock begins acting increasingly emotional, showing anger toward mccoy and deep affection for zarabeth, the woman. he eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on vulcan, 5000 years ago. kirk makes his way back to the library first, and finally convinces mr. atoz they don't belong in his planet's history. spock and mccoy return just before it's too late, leaving zarabeth behind; the enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes, destroying the planet. the interaction between spock and zarabeth provides this episode's most memorable moments, though kirk's adventure into the 'english' past is amusing. all in all, a very decent latter-day star trek outing.",1
"nine out of ten might seem like a high mark to give for a straight to video sci-fi movie that's been vilified at the us box office and roundly criticized as the poorest movie of kurt russell's career.  i have my reasons.  firstly when you read negative reviews of this film, they usually start with the wooden nature of russell's interpretation of todd, the eponymous soldier. i'm going to start here too, with my surprising statement that this is possibly the finest piece of acting i've seen russell pull off. todd is an emotional cripple and suffering from intense ptsd - this movie being written before the phenomenon was as widely recognized as it is now.  the portrayal is spot on. todd is withdrawn, uncommunicative and a loner. he suffers from irrational anxiety - keyed to a fever pitch by training that teaches him to analyze every movement and interaction with another human being for signs of betrayal and danger. his hyper-focus brings with it an inability to comprehend the bigger continuum that the tasks he is given to do sit within - there is a scene where he cuts himself slicing carrots and continues to work unfazed, not cleaning up the cut or the blood. many interpret this as a sign of his physical toughness and focus on the job at hand, but it is also a sign that he is simply performing the requested task by rote - not comprehending the relationship between the vegetables he's preparing and the food that will be eaten later.  todd's dialog is spartan to say the least - the two big talking scenes he gets are central to the plot of the movie and both underline the bleak nature of his existence. fear and discipline we are told. always. fear to keep him pumped up to a hyper alert state where the smallest detail will not pass him by, keeping him ready to react on a knife edge. discipline to hold him in check through his fear, to overcome it and perform tactically. the inference is that he has no time to think and cannot afford feelings. many viewers have different interpretations of his reaction to the hug from nielsen's sandra - but i believe you have to interpret it from the perspective of a human who's only experience of an embrace is in combat - the trembling represents him suppressing his fight / flight instincts reacting to the fear of being grappled, his movement and vision restricted - fear and discipline indeed.  then there is the subtext of his abandonment (twice in fact) - so representative of the way our society tends to toss infantrymen onto the rubbish heap of society when they've served their terms. 40% of the unemployed are ex-military in our world, in his it can only be worse. russell quickly picks up the mantle of mace's responsibility to his wife and child - desperately in need of a mission, even one with such a high likelihood of his death.  then there is the military subtext too - the conflict between busey's church and the hotshot from hq, mekum. mekum's new men are faster, stronger, more accurate and aggressive. any one of them could pound todd into the ground - but it's not about the tools you have it's how you use them. an incentivized todd given the freedom to exercise his initiative and acting without the numbing effect of perceived superiority utilizes ambush tactics and sneaky tricks to cut a swathe through the newer unit - sent in without support, cover or reconnaissance. it is a reminder that military power cannot make up for a failure in leadership.  there are many other subtle themes. when a film is shot and scripted so minimally, it leaves plenty of white space for your own interpretations to take root. watch soldier with an open mind and see what it teaches you.",1
"series three- blackadder the third "" if you want something done properly, kill baldrick before you start"" hot on the heels of the second series the show returned with the current owner of the famous name down on his luck and in service as butler to the prince regent, a vain and stupid foil for blackadders venom, played by hugh laurie. baldrick is still in tow as the other piece of the comedic jigsaw. the format is similar to the previous show, after all now they had found the winning formula why change things. we see blackadder trying to get rich off of the back of the gullible regent in many more ingenious ways, trying to make bladrick an m.p.or trying to woe a suitable bride for the prince. in many ways this is one of the most accurate of the series historically, the prince regent did take control of the throne during his fathers bout of madness and some of the characters lampooned tell a lot about the times. samuel johnson, william pit and wellington all pass through the events and all manage to steal their scenes, not an easy thing with such a stellar cast",1
"there is an interesting discussion in this movie. is being a moral person good enough, or do you need something more?  the movie preaches that without the guidance of god, being a morally good person is not enough. there is a line early in the movie, ""you and i can look at a person who is morally good, but both know he is going to go to hell.""  while i am not a christian, the discussions about this throughout the course of the movie were fascinating, but not in the way the movie intended. i left the movie with a stronger feeling that being morally good *is* enough. the arguments and discussions presented were heavily biased, so much so that they crush themselves in the weight of their own ignorance. fanaticism can be a powerful thing, especially when inferenced in the minds of the ignorant and uneducated. as george carlin's character in dogma said: ""hook em while they're young"".  the basic premise is a very interesting one also. a bible scholar from the 1890s is attempting to publish a book that says that morality without god is ok, as long as the morality is meaningful. do you only tell a child not to steal? or do you tell him not to steal because god tells you not to? (not bothering bringing up that telling the child not to steal because, well, how would he feel if it was his marbles that were stolen?)  the author, carlisle, wants the recommendation of his school to help sell the book (to spread the world). however, it needs unanimous consent, and one of the scholars opposes it. he brings up, in a very interesting discussion early in the film about the morality for morality's sake vs god's words argument. to prove his point, he produces a time machine (put in the movie solely to make the plot work, which i'm fine with), and sends carlisle to the year 2002 to see where teaching morality without god will lead us.  as should be obvious, he has his opinion, and is changed by what he sees, and has reversed himself by the time of his return (for he does return, that's not really a spoiler, this is a bible movie after all).  as for the movie as a movie itself, it's pretty slow and pretty poorly acted. something that was *not* needed in this movie, is that it produces two ""bad guys"" who want to try to figure out who carlisle is, even tho he hasn't hurt anyone, committed a crime, or anything. what's wrong with the movie just showing carlisle's opinion, showing his view of this ""sinful world"", and returning him with a new viewpoint?   also, there a few points in the movie which affirm to me that i'm happy i'm not a christian, or at least someone who says ""it's god or nothing"". three near the end of the movie rather disturbed me.. first, when the two ""bad guys"" corner carlisle right before he jumps, carlisle does his *only* truly despicable act.. he fakes like his time-jump is the coming of jesus, and makes it so the ""bad guys"" (who are also christians btw, oddly enough), think they just missed the rapture.   secondly, after carlisle returns, he finds a boy in which he scolded at the beginning of the movie about not stealing (but not mentioning god, kid kept the marbles and ran away), and tells him this time that stealing is wrong because god commands it. like the carlin quote above, scaring kids into religion is a faux-pas in my book.  and lastly, the epilogue. another scare tactic. carlisle asks the inventor how far into the future they could go, and he says he doesn't know.. the epilogue shows him trying to warp a bible into the distant future (starts at 2100), and it fails.. he keeps decrementing the years by 10, and trying again, and by the fade-out, he's at like 2030 or so. throughout the movie, carlise mentions that he felt the end of the world coming, because the world was rife with sin and the loss of the name of god.. scare tactics have been in use for thousands of years.. you would think in these enlightened times, the church would have enlightened as well.  i'm glad i saw this movie. while i was fairly certain before that being morally good was enough, now i know it for a fact. worth watching if you are not a christian, to affirm how happy you are to not be as ignorant as the folks in this movie.",0
"star rating: ***** saturday night **** friday night *** friday morning ** sunday night * monday morning   the american military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. a renegade pilot (steve touissant) steals it and plots to hold the us government to ransom with it. so they are forced to send in their best man john sands (seagal, who else?) to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years.  i skipped attack force because i could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what i thought. but i decided to give fof a go because shadow man (by the same director) wasn't bad and, what the hell, seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film again. oh what a fool i was.  dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become seagal's trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere.  thankfully his next film, once upon a time in the hood (which i'll be skipping), apparently marks the end of his contract with sony, meaning no more of these awful european lensed action films and his next film prince of pistols might mark a return to theatres. hell, he's done it before and stallone will have managed to do it before him (rocky balboa.)   this isn't a flight of fury. it isn't even a flight of fun. it's a flight that fails to even take off the ground. *",0
"i am compelled to write a review of this imax feature as a means of warning others to save your money. almost any episode of desmond morris' ""the human animal"" or david suzuki's ""the nature of things"" could have bested the material presented. not only does the director fail to make use of imax's incredible 65 to 70 mm film stock and gigantic presentation screen, everything on screen is extremely unimpressive given the accessibility of such programming mentioned previously. viewers are introduced to a pregnant heather, her husband buster, and their niece and nephew. we follow them for an interminable forty-odd minutes as they eat, sweat, listen to music, etc. although we are given access to scenes inside the human digestive track and learn about babies' natural diving reflexes, do we really learn anything more than most grade-school graduates? are we even remotely entertained by the trans-atlantic heather? do we care? avoid this film at all cost. if you do wish to see an imax feature, i suggest the beautifully photographed ""india: kingdom of the tiger"" or the technically thrilling ""space station 3d"". trust me.",0
"let's be honest shall we? al gore no more truly cares about the environment than most folks care about contacting foot fungus. it's a hook! make no mistake, al gore is a politician! three years ago he was busted/ticketed in his home state doing 70 mph in a 55 mph zone driving not a hybrid, a yugo, or even a gm metro but a lincoln (go google it if you like)! or how about the fact that mr. gore & his hollywood buddies continue to use a private fuel-guzzling jets to attend the premiers of ""an inconvenient truth."" so much for conservation huh, al? anyway, it takes a mere minute to subjectively look at ""an inconvenient truth"" & discover the main fundamental flaw. while the film parades out many seemingly impressive scientists to tell the audience the effects of supposed ""global warming"" there is not one scientist to tell us the supposed cause of it. for example: i can take a hundred folks out to a parking lot & they can point out an automobile which is not running right. but can they tell you with any degree of certainty why? generally not! a second flaw, just how accurate were the weather instruments 100 years ago (the toilet wasn't even invented yet)? what did they have, a june bug in a match box? hell, even 50-60 years ago? therefore, how do we know with any degree of certainty that the planet is ""getting warmer"" when the records of yesteryear are highly questionable at best? or that man is the sole cause of it? the answer is we don't & science is never a consensus. thirty years ago, time magazine did a cover proclaiming a ""new ice age"". the truth is that any 6th grade science teacher well versed in earth science will tell you that volcanic erruptions, solar activity & el ninos have more to do with our eradicate changes in climate conditions than supposed ""global warming."" finally, what al gore fails to adequately address is; even if america decides to follow the global gospel according to al & implement everything he recommends, how are we going to get the rest of the world to follow suit when we can't even get them to agree on something so obvious as terrorism? answer: it's wishful thinking, mr. gore & you being a former vp of the usa know it! if the folks who produced ""an inconvenient truth"" were really honest, they would have titled their film ""al gore wants attention."" but what i'd really like is for someone to ask the former vp this; why were two of the planet's biggest polluters (aka china & india) exempt from abiding by the kyoto accords? anyway, i hear the producers of a.i.t are working on their next film entitled ""gnomes, fairies & elves: our endangered friends.""",0
"i know, i know, ""plan 9 from outer space"" is the worst movie, or maybe ""manos, the hands of fate."" but i can't get worked up over those sock-monkey movies. of *course* they're bad. how could they be any good? but if you're talking about movies with respectable production values and bankable talent, the t. rex of all turkeys has to be ""yentl."" all the treacly phoniness, all the self-absorbed asininity, that stains everything barbra streisand has done since 1964, reaches its culmination in this movie. from its lonely summit of awfulness, ""yentl"" looks back to ""a star is born"" and forward to ""the mirror has two faces."" there is nothing else quite like it. what emotional undertow dragged streisand out to make this movie i would rather not speculate, and what audience she was playing to i cannot possibly imagine, although i'll bet there's a nine in ten chance you aren't a member of it.  nobel prize-winner and saintly guardian of yiddish literature isaac bashevis singer was so outraged by what streisand did to his story that he blasted her in public for it. it is a tribute to streisand's impenetrable vulgarity that she not only didn't commit suicide, but went on to make more awful movies.",0
"sometimes a premise starts out good, but because of the demands of having to go overboard to meet the demands of an audience suffering from attention-deficit disorder, it devolves into an incongruous mess. and for three well-respected actors who have made better work before and after, this is a mortal shame.  so let's see. premise: a loving couple who lives in a beautiful home is threatened by a bad cop. interesting to say the least. make the encroaching cop a little disturbing, why not. it was well done in the hand who rocks the cradle and single white female, and it's a proved ticket to a successful thriller.  now herein lies the dilemma. create a disturbing story that actually bothers to bring some true menace into its main characters while never going so far as to look ridiculous, or throw any semblance to reality, amp up the shock factor, and make this cop so extreme -- an ultra bad variation of every other super-villain that's hit cinemas since the silent age.  the producers, and directors, chose the latter. thus is the resulting film -- badly made, with actors trying their darnedest to make heads or tails in roles that they've essayed before, and nothing much amounting to even less.",0
"without doubt beat street is the best film about the breakin scene. everything about it is spot on,the clothes (puma),the music and most importantly the dancing! the storyline is basic,but hey whats there to tell a story about? the whole point of the film is to show what kids of that moment in time were doing,what mattered to them. it shows that teenagers in general are good,all that mattered to these everyday kids was music,dancing and friendship. having watched the dvd recently i was plesantly surprised how well it had stood the test of time! the clothes didn't look dated (possibly because puma is now having a massive comeback),the music still sounds fresh,and the dancing is still captivating to watch. a film anyone 10-25 years of age should see as part of their youth culture.",1

kurosawa really blew it on this one. every genius is allowed a failure. the concept is fine but the execution is badly blurred.  there is an air of fantasy about this film making it something of an art film. the poverty stricken of tokyo deserve a fairer and more realistic portrayal. many of them have interesting stories to tell. a very disappointing film.,0
"the fourth in the ""dirty harry"" series, this film features one of the most despicable, ugliest, unlikable, profane, disgusting females i have ever seen on film: ""ray perkins,"" played by audrie neenan. she is the modern nasty low-life version of the 1945 ""detour"" character, ""ann savage.""  her foul mouth and gutter attitude turned me off so much i never watched this film again until i acquired a profanity filter which shut her up....and least some of her! then i could enjoy the rest of the movie.  everywhere ""harry callahan"" (clint eastwood) goes, violence immediately follows.....within minutes! it happens so often it's almost laughable but it makes for a fast-moving, entertaining film with a satisfying ending as all the scumbag villains are eliminated one-by-one.  this is a very sophomoric film that appeals to our base instincts.....and connects, sad to say. most of us like to see these dirtballs get it in the end, and who does it better than dirty harry?",1
"the movie is truly poignant, unique and uplifting. the story is universal in that it's a battle between good, evil and the world between. the most important thing is that its rating is wrong, misleading, and a travesty. blockbuster has it rated as though it were an x rated movie. the truth is is that it is closer to g than pg and should be seen by children who can read the clear and simple sub-titles.",1

"i loved this movie. the scenery was breathtaking, the plot had some nice twists and turns, and the characters were well rounded. on two fronts, however, ""rob roy"" scored far above average. first, i have rarely seen a ""popular"" film in which the quality of dialogue was so high. there were many verbal slashes and thrusts to accompany the brilliantly choreographed swordplay. i could give numerous examples, but why should i? just watch the film. second, this movie understood a principle rarely acknowledged any more. for a drama to succeed, it needs not only a hero, but a really believable villain. if you don't have one, there's not much joy in rooting for the good guys. and ""rob roy"" has not one, but three--the earl of montrose, his henchman kilairn, and archie. not one-dimensional villains, either, but fully fleshed and very nasty. it takes a bit more patience than ""braveheart""--there's more dialogue, and the accents are a bit tough, but it's a much more clever and subtle piece.

"woosh! man what can i say...?  the opening-scene, maybe? we see a bunch of mongoloid-barbarians with bad make-up jump off the walls of some ruins. they sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl. the dude runs off, the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl, but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her. then, the dude (still on the run) sees a horse and tries to steal it. suddenly a blond god-like looking hero with a bad wig appears, saying ""that's my horse!"". the mighty deathstalker just made his appearance. the mongoloids arrive, deathstalker kills all of them (including the dude) on the tunes of some rather inappropriate mexicanos western score (this is supposed to be a swords & sorcery flick, so what's with the 'arriba-trompettos'?), and then goes up to captive girl and exposes both her breasts. he starts to rub them and captive girl seems to like it. she starts liking her lips and caressing deathstalker. just when they are about to get down to it, this old dude appears, interrupting what could have been the end of a perfect day for deathstalker (and a possible perfect ending for a short-film).  now tell me isn't that the point where either a feminist would angrily switch off the movie, or any other male viewer would say ""this is going to be one hell of a good movie!"" the plot is as simple as throwing a kitten from the balcony: deathstalker must obtain the sword of justice and use it to steal the amulet of life and the chalice of magic from the evil sorcerer munkar.  aside from decapitations, dismemberment, random bloodshed, retarded fist fights and embarrassing sword fights, this film also contains a massive amount of t!ts & a$$ shots. i initially wanted to add one extra point to this movie for each gratuitous shot of naked boobies i could count. after 9 points (not even halfway into the movie), i had to give up counting. it was distracting me from the rest of the movie. and the rest of the movie was worth it. totally crazy stuff. check out this mutant cat/worm-like creature munkar has as a pet and which he feeds eyeballs and fingers. and here's an interesting question: what would you do if a man in a woman's body would enter your bedroom and try to kill you with a knife? the answer is simple: you slap him around a bit, take away the knife and then try to rape him. then you discover that he's actually not a woman, so you throw him out of your bed and tell him to leave your room. it works out well, i tell you. deathstalker does it too, and the deathstalker-way, is the right way!  deathstalker is a wonderful movie, really, as pointed out in other comments. the villains are vile. the women are delicious. there's blood, sex, violence, rape and tasty chicken. there's a completely pointless tournament which just features a bunch of barbarians beating, slashing and hacking the crap out of each other. my favorite weapon used in that tournament was a giant wooden hammer, used to beat a poor contender to bloody pulp. and my favorite contender undoubtedly was that one brute with the warthog-head (reminiscent of the gamorrean guards from return of the jedi). i won't reveal how the movie ends, but just prepare to ravish in delight when i tell you a 4-way dismemberment is thrown into the movie's climax.  and of course, there's a wonderful display of ineptitude throughout the whole movie. see a guy being dragged behind a horse over a dirt road, and the next point-of-view shot shows him being dragged over grass (no road). see that awesome tattoo on the sorcerer's head magically change sides within the same scene (on shot has it on the left side of his head, the other on the right). well, after all, munkar is a magician. it's that, or this movie was shot in an alternate universe where things like ""continuity"" simply don't exist.  as much as i enjoyed this and as much as i am looking forward to the other 3 installments in this series, i do have enough shreds of decency left in me to not let this movie pass. i am prepared, though, to give it the maximum amount of minimal points, just so i could be able to deduct a couple of more points for the possibly inferior sequels to follow. deathstalker might be a superbly fun, trashy & sleazy conan rip-off, it also is an abominable movie.",0

"that's certainly a strange way to promote a film upon which a great deal rested. and it seems like plain suicide on the part of the studio, given that (1) the feuds between the cast were well known long before the movie's release. (2) the feud between the producer(robert fryer) and director ( michael sarne) was also common knowledge. (3) the cast made no secret of their contempt for the film and made it public at every opportunity, with daily bulletins from the set gleefully reported by gossip columnists everywhere.  and (4) the author, gore vidal hated it practically from day one. nevertheless, that tagline just about sums it up. raquel welch does   give a decent performance as myra, and she looks lovely besides. john huston is very funny as buck loner, the ex-cowboy star who runs a phony acting academy. mae west, (in her first screen appearance since 1943) naturally rewrote her part to suit herself, and she is great as ''oversexed'' (and that's putting it mildly) ''talent agent'' leticia van allen. still, she must have wondered (after waiting so long for a good vehicle in which to return) how she ever ended up in this mess.  tom selleck (in his film debut) is one of her ''clients''. john carradine and jim backus, as doctors, also amble in briefly. rex reed as myron, farrah fawcett and roger herren, as the victims of myra/myron's sexual passion, are neither here nor there. the same goes for the script, which not only fails to focus on the basic plot of the book, but seems to head in at least three different directions at once. although west's part was originally larger, she was reduced to a cameo role by the time sarne was through with the editing. and, partly because of this, she seems to be in a different movie. apparently, at some point, the producers realized that mae was going to be the film's big draw, and, unable to replace most of her cut footage, they rushed her back to the set at the end of filming for the second of her two songs, both of which come out of nowhere. the device sarne used of throwing in old film clips of bygone stars to emphasize whatever points he was making, doesn't work at all. by the time the movie concludes, all a weary spectator can do is wonder what in the hell it was all about. not surprisingly, just about everyone connected with the production felt the same way, and it died at the box office. a technically flawless dvd includes, (among other extras) separate commentaries from both welch and sarne, each of whom have completely opposite opinions of just what went wrong.no doubt it's home video re-release was prompted by a 2001'' vanity fair'' piece, which attempted (in great detail) to do the same thing. true, the structure of the novel made a screen adaptation a dubious undertaking, but, with sarne at the helm of what was obviously a ''troubled'' production, it really never had a chance.",0
i know that the real story of little richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic. but then producer little richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s.,0
"for those of you who've never heard of it (or seen it on a&e), cracker is a brilliant british tv show about an overweight, chain-smoking, foulmouthed psychologist named fitz who helps the manchester police department get into the heads of violent criminals. it's considered to be one of the finest shows ever to come out of england (and that's saying something), and was tremendously successful in england and around the world back in 1993.  now, the original stars have re-teamed with the original writer to knock out one more 2-hour episode. i've loved this show ever since i'd first seen it, over a decade ago. the dvd box set holds a place of honor in my collection, and i can quote a good deal of fitz's interrogation scenes practically word for word. the idea of robbie coltrane reteaming with jimmy mcgovern for another tv movie about fitz filled me with absolute glee.  i'll start with the good. one of the many things that impressed me about the original cracker series was how quickly fitz was defined as a character. five minutes into the first episode  with his lecture (throwing the books into the air), his drinking, and his cussing of the guy after him on the gambling machine queue  and you knew, simply knew, who this character was. you could feel him ""clicking"" in your mind, the kind of click that only happens when a great actor gets a great role written by a great writer.  coltrane, of course, remained great throughout the show, but i always felt that some of the later episodes  those not written by mcgovern  mistreated the character.  so the good news is this: fitz is back. as soon as you see him in this show  making incredibly inappropriate comments at his daughter's wedding  you'll feel that ""click"" once again. it's him: petulant one moment and truly sorry the next, always insightful, sincere to the point of tactlessness but brilliantly funny in the process. if you love this character as much as i do, you'll be delighted with how he is portrayed in the movie. and this extends to judith and mark: in fact, everything having to do with the fitzs is handled perfectly.  the problem i do have with this movie revolves around the crime fitz is trying to solve. in standard cracker fashion, we know exactly who the criminal is in the first five minutes  the suspense lies in seeing fitz figure it out. in this case, we have a serial killer who is out for american blood. and the reason for this, unfortunately, is not due to any believable psychological trauma  rather, it seems that the murders are here simply to allow the writer to display his personal political beliefs.  it's difficult for me to write this, as i truly believe that jimmy mcgovern is one of the greatest writers in the world. nor do i have a problem with movies that are about current issues, or movies that take a political stand. but in the cracker universe, we expect to see the characters behaving like human beings, not like caricatures. instead, the americans in this movie are all depicted in an entirely stereotypical fashion. they're know-nothing loudmouths who complain about everything, treat the locals like crap and cheat on their wives  one of them even manages to do all of the above within less than 5 minutes. i honestly thought i'd mistakenly switched channels or something.  but it doesn't stop there. we get constant reminders of just how badly the war in iraq is going  reminders that have nothing whatsoever to do with the story and appear practically out of nowhere. the killer is so busy ranting about how bush is worse than hitler that he almost forgets to get on with the killing; but more to the point, he is such a mouthpiece for the writer's political views that he forgets to act like a believable human being, and thus we  as an audience  don't buy his sudden transformation from a happy family man to a tortured serial-killing soul.  i can't say that this ruined the show for me  it's was still good tv, better than almost everything else in the genre (mainly due to, once again, coltrane). but its constant politicizing made it impossible for it to be as good as the real cracker classics like ""to be a somebody""  an episode that was just as ""issuey"", but one that was handled with far more subtlety and psychological depth.  two other small points: panhandle not being around is a disappointment, but what's worse are her replacements. the entire police department  which for so long filled with such great characters - is now full of vanilla. completely interchangeable cops who lack any and all personality (how you could drain coupling's richard coyle of personality is beyond me, but it is indeed missing here).  also, there are couple of moments where the show lost its believability for me. one such instance revolves around fitz having to narrow down the entire population of manchester from 1 million to a hundred based on some very strange criteria (french windows? how does the computer know if i have french windows?)  he not only succeeds in doing this, but he succeeds in less than an hour. i don't think so.  so, all in all, i was a little disappointed. it's recommended viewing, but remember to leave at least some of your expectations at the door. still, if there's new series to come after this, it would all have been for the good: i'm convinced that mcgovern can still write great stuff, and maybe now that he's got his politics out of his system he can go back to writing about people.",0
"i love this freekin movie! walsh is a true master of the cinematic form, his film have been sometimes in my opinion, overlooked. but this film is a favourite of mine because it really gives you the feel of the time the film was set in.\  all the wonderful characters that existed, the lifestyle, the mode of dress, the way they spoke, ok they might be exaggerated, but it is good to know that there were occasion when two men tried to outdo each other with insane stunts.  i just felt it was apiece of history thats should be wathced by many people and appreciated because of that fact.  can i get it somewhere on dvd? i have only seen it on tv. but for anyone wanting a slice of life movie about that period of time this is the perfect one.",1
"the first episode immediately gave a good impression what to expect from the series! mysteries waiting to be solved and a lot of good drama! i love the fact that they gradually reveal the stories concerning the characters! explaining just enough to stay excited! of course this show has some flaws! in the first two series there are some characters who for some reason don't show up in the third season! many of the characters have a decent sent off but some of them just aren't there! like rose and her husband! where the hell are they? what happened to them? maybe they will return in later episodes! but it is a little inconsistent! that being said ""lost"" manages to be thrilling every episode(especially the first two seasons)! that is a very hard thing to do! i do notice that in the third season the focus is more on character development than the mystery aspects of the show! this is not a bad thing! it even saves some episodes from getting boring! one of the elements that can be considered the strength of this show are the wonderful characters! you will grow to love these characters! good or bad! but eventually i will want to see some mysteries to be solved and get closure! the danger of ""lost"" getting canceled due to declining ratings is near! and that would be devastating!",1
"prominent attorney walter pidgeon takes a murder case pro bono, wins an acquittal and discovers that his client (keefe braselle) was not only guilty but part of an extortion ring reaching to the highest eschelons of the city. panged by his own complicity, he undertakes an investigation, stumbles onto the identity of the ""unknown man"" who heads the syndicate, and murders him.  the ironies engage when braselle is charged with this second murder and pidgeon must defend him by pointing to the existence of another ""unknown man"" -- himself. though somewhat short of urban grit and long on rhetoric, the unknown man belongs to the noir cycle less by style or structure than by its acknowledgement of the pervasive corruption of american municipal politics that came to light in the postwar years.",1
"marvelous cult film from 1979 in which the students of vince lombardi high school are confronted with a new, dictatorial principal named miss togar (mary woronov). togar is a music hater and blames the musical tastes of the students for their transgressions. leading the charge against her is fun-loving riff randell (p.j. soles), the #1 ramones fan who, more than anything, wants the rock group to record her songs.  now *this* is an impossible movie to resist. first and foremost, the soundtrack is incredible, with songs by such artists as alice cooper and the velvet underground in addition to the infectious non-stop assortment of ramones songs. ""teenage lobotomy"", ""sheena is a punk rocker"", and ""blitzkrieg bop"" are just a few of them. next, the cast truly gives it their all, with soles an ideal choice for the role of riff; she is a true delight. vincent van patten and dey young are earnest as tom and kate, woronov is well cast against type as the snooty and disdainful togar, clint howard has one of his best ever parts as washroom-occupying entrepreneur eaglebauer, and new world regulars such as dick miller, paul bartel (particularly fun as music teacher mr. mcgree) and the real don steele are fun as always. and, of course, it's a treat to see the ramones playing themselves.  the movie has true spirit. the energy level is high, with co-story author and director allan arkush bringing a great deal of flair to the proceedings. there's also a great sense of humor. the paper airplane gag is a superb example of this. this extends right to the ""wipe"" style of scene transitions. there are even hilarious giant mice created by future makeup effects notable rob bottin, in one of his earliest gigs.  about as good as an authority-defying, defend-one's-right-to-party film can get. ""rock 'n' roll high school"" is, quite simply, a wonderful cult film.  8/10",1
"i had never heard of this one before it turned up on cable tv. it's very typical of late 50s sci-fi: sober, depressing and not a little paranoid! despite the equally typical inclusion of a romantic couple, the film is pretty much put across in a documentary style - which is perhaps a cheap way of leaving a lot of the exposition to narration and an excuse to insert as much stock footage as is humanly possibly for what is unmistakably an extremely low-budget venture! while not uninteresting in itself (the-apocalypse-via-renegade-missile angle later utilized, with far greater aplomb, for both dr. strangelove [1964] and fail-safe [1964]) and mercifully short, the film's single-minded approach to its subject matter results in a good deal of unintentional laughter - particularly in the scenes involving an imminent childbirth and a gang of clueless juvenile delinquents!",0
"i've seen this movie twice with my teenagers who love it. this one ought to be a cult fave! the best line, ""your dress is deeply cool!"" says the prince to cinderella. kathleen turner shines as the stepmother. i also like the 1950's era cars and motorcycles. the melancholy prince is a great departure from the typical swashbuckler. he tries to stay cool, but fails to hide his love for the fairy-tale princess-to-be. her slipper is not glass (truer to the original story), but cinderella loses is nonetheless but gets it back from the heir to the throne. my only complaint is that it is not shown more and seems to be almost impossible to get. hopefully blockbuster or amazon will start stocking this one sometime soon.",1

"arnold once again in the 80's demonstrated that he was the king of action and one liners in this futuristic film about a violent game show that no contestant survives. but as the tag line says arnold has yet to play! the movie begins in the year 2019 in which the world economy has collapsed with food and other important materials in short supply and a totalitarian state has arisen, controlling every aspect of life through tv and a police state. it's most popular game show is the running man, in which criminals are forced to survive against ""stalkers"" that live to kill them.  the movie opens with ben richards (arnold) leading a helicopter mission to observe a food riot in progress. he is ordered by his superiors to fire on them, refusing to gets him knocked out and thrown in prison, in the meantime they slaughtered the people without his help. the government blames richards for the massacre earning him the name ""butcher of bakersfield"". eighteen months later richards along with two friends william laughlin (koto) and harold weiss (mcintyre) breakout of a detention zone they worked in. they make their way to the underground, led by mic (mick fleetwood). mic quickly identifies richards as the ""butcher of bakersfield"" and refuses to help him, but his friend's convince him otherwise. they want him to join the resistance, but he'd rather go live with his brother and get a job. soon he finds that his brother has been taken away for reeducation and a woman name amber mendez (alonso) has taken his apartment. knowing who he is she won't help him, but he convinces her, but is busted at the airport by the cops after she ratted him out.  meantime, the running man is having trouble finding good new blood for the there stalkers to kill. damon killian (dawson) the shows host and one of the most powerful men in the country sees richards escape footage and is able to get him for the show after his capture. richards refuses to play, killian threatens to use his friends instead of him, so he signs the contract. you'll love that part. but soon he finds they will join him as well and makes sure killian knows he'll be back. the runners begin to make there way through the zones and fight characters that are memorable, sub-zero, buzz saw and many others. eventually richards is joined by amber who suspected he was set up but was caught and thrown into the game too. together they find the underground and make there way back to killian and give him a farewell send off.  the running man is another one of arnold's great movies from the 80's. the movie was apparently somewhat based on stephen king's book of the same name. some have said that the book is better. i'm sure it's not and i don't care anyway i loved the movie. as in all of arnold's films the acting is what you would expect with classic one liners from arnold and even ventura gets a couple in. but without a doubt richard dawson is the standout in this film. being a real game show host he easily spoofed himself and was able to create a character that was truly cold blooded. the whole movie itself somewhat rips on game shows and big brother watching you. keep an eye out for them poking fun and some old shows, ""hate boat"" among others. also the cast was great besides arnold, koto, and alonzo don't forget professor toru tanaka, jim brown, ventura and sven-ole! with all the reality tv nonsense that goes on it almost fits in better now, but i'm sure the hollywood liberals would make it into a movie about the ""evil bush"". the new dvd had mostly poor extras meet the stalkers being the only redeemable one. some how the aclu managed to get some of there communism into the dvd and is laughable garbage that should not be anywhere near an arnold movie of all things. blasphemy! overall for any arnold fan especially we who grew up in the 80's on him ,you can't miss this. its one of the first ones i saw back in the 80's and it's still great to this day. the futuristic world and humor are great. overall 10 out 10 stars, definitely one of his best.",1
"the feel of this movie was amazing. adam sandler's performance was very inspiring. as he played a very rattled and fragile character, he took his ability to the very edge and really worked the role. his character was really interesting. i can see myself reading the script for this movie and not being half as interested in the part as sandler made me. for someone who plays primarily comedy roles, he pulled off a serious role with what seemed to be his own quirks and input. i especially loved the scene in which adam and don's characters rode the motorized scooter around the city. i familiarized with the moment, because it seemed like don was witnessing one thing adam does to get away from it all. with his video games, music, and many other things he does to keep him from thinking about the past, riding his scooter with his headphones on seemed like an escape from his thoughts. this movie is definitely worth the watch.",1
"i'm surprised that no one yet has mentioned that there are two versions of this same film. the lion's share of the footage in both is identical, but here is where they differ: in one version (the version i have seen most often on broadcast tv), the group of clerics guarding the gateway consists of the ""brotherhood of the protectors"", a (fictional) splinter group of priests and brothers ""excommunicated"" by the church. in the other version, which i've seen only once on tv, the clerics guarding the gateway are depicted as priests of the official church, meaning the archdiocese of new york (or perhaps brooklyn). also, in the former version, in most of the pertinent scenes, the clerics are referred to as ""brothers"" (and in some scenes, you can see where the lips say ""father"" so-and-so but the dubbed audio says ""brother"" so-and-so. in the latter version, i believe everyone is referred to as ""father"".  in any event, it seems that one of these two versions is more or less a partial re-shooting of the other, with all ""brotherhood of the protector"" scenes re-shot as ""archdiocese"" scenes, or vice versa. (kind of reminds me of the raymond burr cutaway scenes in ""godzilla""). i have videotaped both versions off broadcast tv, so no, i'm not imagining this. can anyone shed some more light on the story behind these two versions of the film?",1
"this is arguably the best film director haim bouzaglo made until now. a skilled tv director, well-trained in story-telling and in directing his actors through long epics he tried to catch in this very low-budget film the essence of the very special psychological situation the israelis live though under the permanent danger of the terror attacks, resulting in 'distorted' lives. each character trying to live his own life, to watch and control the other, while being himself watched and controlled by other characters and mostly by the continuous pressure, by political and historical forces well beyond his control. some call this destiny, but destiny has a very concrete representation in this film.  there is no explicit political saying in 'distortion'. characters never discuss politics, not even at the level of saying 'bastards!' when they hear that a new terror attack happens. their reaction to events is to localize the attack and to count the victims using the official and media terminology for the dead and the wounded. they do not really live but rather survive on borrowed time happy to have survived one bomb, and waiting for the next one to happen. personal, social, professional life seems to work someway, but is deeply flawed and influenced by events. the main character played by the director is a playwright whose mid-life personal and creative crisis is amplified by the pressure of the events and by the fact that he is lucky enough to leave a terror attack site minutes before the bomb explodes. he hires a private detective to follow his girlfriend who is a tv investigative reporter whom he suspects is falling in for the subject of her next show - another failed man, former military, whose business and family life dismantles under the events. he starts to write a play that carbon-copies the reality and will bring it to the stage, in theater in film scene that reminds hamlet as well as 'synecdoche, new york'. it's not that i would dare suspect charlie kaufman looking over the shoulder of bouzaglo, he certainly needs not that, but the israeli director screen is brilliant into anticipating the later film (and the first directed by kaufman). as in the american film actors play real persons and start interacting with them in an reality-meets-stage-meets-reality melange which never lacks logic, at least not artistic logic.  bouzaglo directs his actors with the usual talent, trusts them and allows them the freedom of living through the situations rather then acting them. his style is much more free here than in his tv series, and the 'distortion' effects, although borrowed from american horror movies work pretty well all over. the ending seemed to me a little rhetorical and unsatisfying dramatically, but the shade of the suicidal killer who is haunting the film and the whole situation in a temporal loop will also follow the viewer when remembering later this film.",1
"don't get me wrong, i love action and revenge flicks, i've seen many of them since i was a kid, including dolph lundgren's latest ""the mechanik"" which is quite good. and tony scott certainly know how to use a camera and even might be a genius shooting and editing films.  but with ""man on fire"" (and even more then with ""domino""), scott shows that rather than using his film-making ""genius"" skills intelligently, he uses it puposelessly to show off and compensate a lack of substance that his material doesn't offer him. ""man of fire"" is close to 2 hours and half when it really should have been at least an hour less.  the way scott shot and edited this film also makes you wonder if he really wants you (the audience) to sit through his film because his constant camera moves and flashes really are a torture for the eye and makes you wanna leave the theater or turn it off after 5 minutes into it.  at times where the mpaa and studios have questionable attitudes regarding ratings, violence and making pg-13 movies, i find also suspicious that a $70 million movie is made of a b-movie script with a character who cuts fingers, puts a bomb in a man's ass and blows a guy's hand with a shotgun, all this to avenge the death of a little girl who isn't even dead! go figure then why a studio will pass a better script because of the language or violence... thus said...",0
"as it is generally known,anthology films don't fare very well with american audiences (i guess they prefer one standard plot line). new york,i love you, is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities & the people who live & love in them. the first was 'paris,j'taime', which i really enjoyed. the film was made up of several segments,each written and/or directed by a different director (most of which were french,but there is a very funny segment directed by joel & ethan coen). like 'paris', this one is also an anthology, directed by several different directors (fatih akin,mira nair,natalie portman,shakher kapur,etc.),and also like 'paris'deals with new yorkers,and why they love the city they live in. it features a top notch cast,featuring the likes of natalie portman,shia labeouf,christina ricci,orlando bloom,ethan hawki,and also features such seasoned veterans as james caan,cloris leachman,eli wallach and julie christie. some of the stories really fly,and others don't (although i suppose it will depend on individual tastes---i won't ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me & which ones didn't). word is that the next entry in the series will be shanghai, china (is rome,italy,berlin,germany or athens,greece out of the question?). spoken mainly in english,but does have bits of yiddish & russian with english subtitles. rated 'r'by the mpaa for strong language & sexual content",1

"a film with very little positive to say for it.  firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.  besides being remarkably slow the empty acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. i lost count of how many times i had seen ""that"" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.  it also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. so with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. we find jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. beth has a key to a warehouse of books? there are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.  and on the point of the acre. horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so.  there is also a frightening lack of reasonability as beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on ""medication"".  with the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? he's six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene. bad plinky plonk ""horror"" music fails to add atmosphere.  often bad films can be amusing but not the empty acre, which is just bad.",0
"the summary pretty much sums it all up. this is nowhere near as good as the original. with a script co-written by both stallone and james cameron (at the same time he was also writing aliens). most of the action was written by cameron and the political aspects were written by stallone.  sly was in the best condition physically as he was making this and rocky 4 and he does look in great shape or jacked up to the eyeballs on steroids, depending on your own viewpoint or opinion.  rambo starts off in prison and is visited by colonel trautman who asks him to go on a special mission that could earn him a presidential pardon. he eventually agrees and goes off to the briefing camp run by charles napier playing a washington suit trying to pass himself off as former ex-forces to placate rambo.  the mission is to find out if there are any missing pows still alive in camps in vietnam. rambo was chosen as the camp he was checking was somewhere he had previously been a prisoner himself. he is told it's not a rescue mission and he is there to take recon photos only.  after a bad attempt at parachuting from a plane he loses most of his kit, meets his contact (who turns out to be a cute woman) and travels down river with pirates to the camp.  he finds there are still prisoners and rescues one. as the 3 flee from half the vietnamese army on their river boat they are betrayed by the pirates but rambo kills them all and they are forced to carry on to the pick-up point on foot after their boat is rammed and blown up with rambo almost on board.  rambo is betrayed again and abandoned as napier orders the recall of the rescue helicopter. it is clear as trautman returns to base to berate him that no survivors were expected to be found.  steven berkoff turns up as a russian spetznatz colonel and rambo is tortured and eventually escapes only to be pursued by more vietnamese troops and spetznatz. killing many of them, rambo finally steals a chopper and rescues most of the prisoners to return to his base.  he resists the urge to kill napier for abandoning him but destroys the ops centre.  a weak plot and very weak ending as rambo walks off into the sunset as a free man.",0

"the film is a bit tedious. it's mostly a silent film, with the bulk o the story provided through a series of voice-overs. while making a silent film like this is not such a bad idea, this is one of those films where the lack of dialog and the repetitive early scenes make it simply tedious. you don't understand the reason for the tedium until well into the picture, and by then it's too late. the first 40 minutes of film is something of a slow piece of mexican soft porn, and unimaginative soft porn at that. later in the film the style of the first 40 minutes starts to makes sense, but it's too late, because by then the audience is lost. there is some nice location shooting at the national autonomous university of mexico. i've often wondered why more films aren't shot there. the campus is built on the edge of lava fields that lend the campus a very otherworldly feel. my biggest problem with the film is that the director/writer has made the film the way he wanted to see it without regard for how a viewer who doesn't know the story will view it. you can't ignore the audience when you tell a story.",0

"i have to say, when ""pushing daisies"" came out i was immediately won out by the fairy-tale like setting of such grimness. the narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as, well, ned (lee pace) baking pies. and that bringing them back to life was just as routine.  the trio of ned, emerson cod (chi mcbride) and charlotte ""chuck"" charles (anna friel), plus sometimes-sidekick olive snook (kristin chenoweth, who made the musical wicked such a delight) made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness. it definitely deserves the title of a (romantic) comedy/drama.  ned and chuck made for a shy and not-quite-ready-for-love couple who are still exploring their feelings even though they cannot touch - an obstacle that seems to be truly no obstacle with aids such as gloves, cellophane, and quirky schedules around the apartment. but despite the awkwardness presented as they work their feelings around a strange secret which only a few know, they still manage to show their on screen chemistry in touching scenes like when ned gives chuck the beehives. the presence of olive, though, makes for some break-out-in-song moments in the pie shop and unforeseen complications for the couple.  second season sharply declined, putting a damper on a show that had real potential. on some of the episodes, the plot line was rushed and awkward, making you ask ""what just happened?"" in both the overall dead-person-of-the-week plot and in the overriding plot line. the addition of chuck's father plus two half-brothers for ned didn't help, and at least one of the plot lines felt almost recycled (didn't the episode ""comfort food"" feel like the episode ""bitter sweets"" in the fact that the dead-person-of-the-week died in food?). a few touching moments (the beehives) happened to help advance the relationship between chuck and ned, but every time they got close, the writers decided to throw in another monkey wrench rather than let the relation develop (oliver comes back from the monastery, chuck's dead father comes back to life and doesn't go back, you get the picture).  shame it didn't work out, but the concept was good and seemed surreal in a good way, just enough pleasantvillesque color/happy-smiley going on and implausible scenarios to remind you that it's not ""dead like me."" then again, it's in ""pushing daisies time,"" according to creator bryan fuller, so it makes it plausible again.  it should have lasted longer, but it's merely wistful thinking at this point. kudos to whatever new show attempts to replace this short-lived gem.",1
"i went in to see d-war on a whim and with very low expectations. the movie failed to meet them.  i don't mind stories that stretch credulity - remember reign of fire? - but i do expect them to be internally consistent. this film leapt from howler to howler without pausing for breath, all interspersed with special effects that lagged far behind the likes of lotr or even godzilla.  a shape-shifting mystic warrior from korea, curiously metamorphosed into a caucasian antique dealer and popping up like deus ex machina to get the hapless protagonists out of their latest mess. a special agent from the fbi who seems to be completely boned up on ancient korean folklore because of the fed's excellent ""paranormal division"" - which has gone unremarked up to this point. lovers kissing on deserted beaches where one exclaims ""i never meant for this to happen."" a reincarnated pair of long dead koreans who ""died like star-crossed lovers."" mystic pendants, faceless hordes of robotic soldiers (that owe a lot to peter jackson's orcs) and a serpent who wastes so much time roaring that every time its chosen prey is within reach something comes along to distract it.  the dialogue is appalling, the acting wooden and the effect of the whole was, to be honest, tedious. however, for me the crowning moment was at the end, after the finale, when the music for the closing credits was - arirang! this is rather like akira kurosawa closing ""ran"" with a karaoke rendition of my way - and let me be clear that i am in no way comparing director shim to kurosawa.  in short, a self indulgent, lackluster collection of clichés and narrative non-sequituurs which may appeal to the sense of the melodramatic so prevalent in koran popular culture but should not be worth the price of the ticket to any serious movie goer - or even a not so-serious movie goer. i would suggest that this bypass the movie theaters altogether and go straight to video, but i'm not even sure that it's worth that much.",0
"fragmentaric movie about a couple of people in austria during a heatwave. this kind of movie has been done more often, and most of all, better. the stories don't really have anything to do with each other, apart from the pathetic finale: 'people are cruel'. ugly flesh, unpleasant people and a movie that goes on way too long without really making a point... ultra-realistic? hardly... boring? indeed. not even gorgeous franzisca weiss can save this one! 3/10",0
"the earth is destined to be no more thanks to father pergado and a bunch of nuns. christopher lee (who has since said that he was duped in to appearing in this by his producers who told him loads of great actors were involved) is father pergado and gets to do his usual serious and scary routine. the cast are not too bad, though most have now retired from acting. the film has terrible sound effects (mainly created from pressing keys on an old computer it seems) and it ridiculously pondering at times - showing a scene of the sky, for instance, for what feels like hours at a time. despite this the story is pretty humorous in a world-is-doomed sort of way and the production is adequate. interestingly one scene features albert band and wife jackie; meda band; writer frank ray perilli and charles band's assistant bennah burton. despite its plodding nature i genuinely wanted to see how it all worked out and thus quite liked it.",0
"""metamorphosis"" hold a tiny bit of cult-value, simply because it was written and directed by george eastman. this italian bloke is more or less the personification of male sleaze and starred in pretty much every rancid joe d'amato production during the late 70's/early 80's. wouldn't it be interesting for avid euro-cult purchasers to own the only movie directed by the guy who walked around bare-butted in ""erotic nights of the living dead"" all the time? i thought so! now, unlike the movies he starred in, eastman's own ""metamorphosis"" is kind of disappointing in the gore & sleaze departments. there are a handful of nasty murders, cheesy monster effects and naked female bodies (a guest appearance by sleaze-queen laura gemser!) on display, but it's mainly a talkative movie. the handsome & eloquent dr. houseman is on the verge of a scientific breakthrough with his research on human dna codes when suddenly the university he works for threatens to cancel his funds. he developed a theory to decode genes and block the human ageing process, but if he doesn't come up with detailed reports any time soon, his research will be stopped. so dr. houseman does what any intelligent scientist would do and injects the untested serum into his own veins. needless to say (and like the title implies), he slowly turns into murderous monster that actually ages much quicker! in other words, his research sucked! like the other reviewers already mentioned, this movie ""borrows"" a lot of ideas from david cronenberg's ""the fly""  the dramatic romance sub plot included - but doesn't add any originality from its own. the big difference is that you constantly feel connected with jeff goldblum's character in ""the fly"", whereas dr. houseman becomes just another monster that needs to be destroyed as fast as possible. the rapid-ageing-syndrome aspect also reminded me of ruggero deodato's sadly underrated giallo ""phantom of death"", only the protagonist in that film inherited the disease and didn't inflict it on himself. the physical deterioration of the carriers is very similar in both films, though. few scares or excitement to discover here, instead the movie features loads of bad acting, poor lighting, lousy editing and a completely retarded climax to boot. feel free to skip this one.",0

"i had to see this gem twice to really appreciate all of it. when a widowed father of two interrupts his two sons' sleep with a shocking revelation, they are torn between believing him and not. as the horrifying events of this tale unfold, we learn a lot about the father, about his two sons, and about their destinies. with shocking twist after shocking twist, this film never allows for a lull in the plot. bill paxton plays the father, but the most notable performances are that of his older son, fenton, played by matthew o'leary and his younger son, adam, played by jeremy sumpter. this is one of the best thrillers that i have seen in a while, and you will want to watch this a few times to appreciate every intricate aspect of the plot. i give this film a 9/10.",1
"this is a gem, a real piece of americana for all that this implies. if you are self programed to resist ""life-afirming"" stories, just stay away and leave the pleasure to the rest of us who still believe. and what makes the frosting on the cake truly delectable is that it is fact based on a real rags to riches story, no need to nit-pick what details were changed to make a compact story. chris cooper is one of the greatest living actors, and the complex, self-conflicted, bottom-line good at the core father he portrayed could only be pulled off successfully by someone with his skill and insight. the simple minded comments, refusing to accept a father who tries to lay down the law all the while sensing that he may possibly be off-track, expose the limitation of the commentator, not the writers or the acting. this is not for the cynical, or the simple minded.",1
"this movie was featured on a very early episode of mystery science theater 3000, but when i see this film, i don't think about that wonderful tv series. i believe this was a surprisingly good early 40's horror flick, with very surprisingly good sound and picture for a 67 year old public domain horror movie. i actually enjoyed watching bela lugosi and his bizarre staff, including his wife who requires fluid from the glands of young would-be brides, an old hag, and her two bizarre sons, one a giant idiot, the other a comical dwarf(angelo rossitto from 1932's freaks). i also enjoyed the plucky young female reporter, who is kind of a stereotype, but still fun to watch. my only problem with this otherwise decent film is it's plot, even ridiculous and unbelievable for a movie. i don't want to spoil any of this film, so go out and rent it, or, better yet, buy it for a couple of bucks.",1
"'the student of prague' is an early feature-length horror drama or, rather, it is an ""autorenfilm"" (i.e. an author's film). this film is a member of a movement of many movements that tried to lend respectability to cinéma, or just make a profit, by adapting literature or theatre onto the screen. fortunately, the story of this book with moving pictures is good. using alfred de musset's poem and a story by edgar allen poe, it centres on the doppelgänger theme.  unfortunately, the most cinematic this film gets is the double exposure effects to make paul wegener appear twice within scenes. guido seeber was a special effects wizard for his day, but he's not very good at positioning the camera or moving it. film scholar leon hunt (printed in ""early cinema: space, frame, narrative""), however, has made an interesting analysis on this film using framing to amplify the doubles theme: characters being split by left/right, near/far and frontal/diagonal framing of characters and shots. regardless, the film mostly consists of extended long shots from a fixed position, which is noticeably primitive. worse is the lack of editing; there's very little scene dissection and scenes linger. none of this is unusual for 1913, but there were more advanced films in this respect around the same time, including the better parts of 'atlantis' (august blom, 1913), 'twilight of a woman's soul' (yevgeni bauer, 1913) and the short films of d.w. griffith.  an expanded universal film vocabulary by 1926 would allow for a vastly superior remake. furthermore, the remake has a reason for the lyduschka character, other than being an occasional troublemaker and spectator surrogate. here, the obtrusively acted gypsy lurks around, seemingly, with a cloak of invisibility. i know their world is silent to me, but i assume, with their lips moving and such, that their world would not be silent to them, so how can lyduschka leer over others' shoulders and not be noticed?  nevertheless, this is one of the most interesting early films conceptually. wegener, who seems to have been the primary mind behind this film, in addition to playing the lead, would later play the title role and co-direct 'the golem' in 1920--helping to further inaugurate the supernatural thread in german silent cinéma.  (note: the first version i viewed was about an hour long (surely not quite complete) and was in poor condition, with faces bleached at times and such. i'm not sure who was the distributor. i've also since seen the alpha dvd, which, at 41 minutes, is missing footage present in the aforementioned print and also has fewer and very different title cards, but is visually not as bad. the repetitive score is best muted, though.)",1

"they had me from the first show.  welcome to trinity county. a sleepy little mayberry-like place with one slight difference. the sheriff is really satan. there's the spoiler. not like you wouldn't figure it out in 10 minutes anyway.  oh, but that's not all. it turns out that satan has a son named caleb. some people are trying to keep him good, but it's an uphill battle. sheriff buck (satan) knows who caleb is and likes to spend time with him teaching him the ways of darkness. subtle. sneaky. he doesn't always come off as evil. most of the time he's a hero. everyone owes him a big favor, because he often sets up a calamity and saves them from it. so every time you think someone will finally take him down, one of his friends comes out of nowhere to sabotage it.  in one of my favorite episodes, lucas and caleb were out in the woods in a cabin and some guys with guns decided to rob them. lucas used it as an excuse to teach caleb a lesson about evil.  the robber (ted) was hesitant to shoot them. lucas told caleb that ted had half a conscience. if he had no conscience, he would have shot them by now. if he had a real conscience, he never would have become a criminal. so he started calling him half-ted. it was pretty funny. he was taunting the criminals. and of course he stayed 10 steps ahead of half-ted at all times. and of course he was in complete control at all times. they actually had you favoring satan.  very very excellent show. it was one of my favorite horror shows of all time. twilight zone night stalker circle of fear american gothic supernatural  that's good company.",1

"i am amazed at how this movie(and most others has a average 5 stars and lower when there are crappy movies averaging 7 to 10 stars on imdb. the fanboy mentality strikes again. when this movie came out just about everyone slammed it. even my ex-girlfriend said this movie questionable. years later i sat down to watch this movie and i found myself enjoying. even laughing quite a bit. this and the replacement killers are the movies that had people labeling the director antoine fuqua as the black michael bay. i don't see how since most of fuqua's movies are smarter than anything michael bay has came up with. at any rate...  story: alvin sanders(jamie foxx) is former convict that is used by a no-nonsense treasury agent edgar(david morse) as a pawn to catch a killer named bristol(doug hutchinson). alvin's every moves are tracked by a bug implanted in his jaw after an accident. while these agents are after bristol, bristol is after the gold bricks that were taken in a heist gone awry.  jamie foxx is funny as well as great as alvin sanders. alvin is a fast-talker that is a lot smarter than he lets on. doug hutchinson is okay as bristol. he can be over-the-top sometimes in his john malkovitchesque demeanor. he was better here than he was as looney bin jim in punisher: war zone. david morse is good as the hard edged treasury agent. even mike epps is funny as alvin's brother stevie. both him and jamie had some funny moments on screen.  the only flaw of the movie is the some of the attempts at a thriller fall flat. the scenario at the horse race track is way over-the-top but i couldn't look away. the director went all out there so he gets points for that. plus the bomb scene with the treasury agent tied to a chair while the detonator rests on the door was pretty nifty.  all in all bait is not a bad movie by a long shot. its never boring, its always funny and i wasn't checking my watch every minute. that should count for something. bait is one of the most underrated movies of 2000 period.  ps: to the reviewer that claimed this movie is too violent.... how long have you been living under a rock? i'm pretty sure you've seen the die hard series and every movie by quentin tarantino. but those movies aren't violent right? weirdo.",1

"coming from the same director who'd done ""candyman"" and ""immortal beloved"", i'm not surprised it's a good film. ironically, ""papierhaus"" is a movie i'd never heard of until now, yet it must be one of the best movies of the late 80s - partly because that is hands down the worst movie period in recent decades. (not talking about iranian or swedish ""cinema"" here...) the acting is not brilliant, but merely solid - unlike what some people here claim (they must have dreamt this ""wondrous acting"", much like anna). the story is an interesting fantasy that doesn't end in a clever way that ties all the loose ends together neatly. these unanswered questions are probably left there on purpose, leaving it up to the individual's interpretation, and there's nothing wrong with that with a theme such as this. ""pepperhaus"" is a somewhat unusual mix of kids' film and horror, with effective use of sounds and music. i like the fact that the central character is not your typical movie-cliché ultra-shy-but-secretly-brilliant social-outcast girl, but a regular, normal kid; very refreshing. i am sick and tired of writers projecting their own misfit-like childhoods into their books and onto the screens, as if anyone cares anymore to watch or read about yet another miserly, lonely childhood, as if that's all there is or as if that kind of character background holds a monopoly on good potential. the scene with anna and the boy ""snogging"" (for quite a stretch) was a bit much - evoking feelings of both vague disgust and amusement - considering that she was supposed to be only 11, but predictably it turned out that burke was 13 or 14 when this was filmed. i have no idea why they didn't upgrade the character's age or get a younger actress. it was quite obvious that burke isn't that young. why directors always cast kids older than what they play, hence dilute the realism, i'll never know.",1

"bette davis' electrifying performance is such that it is hard to remember the other female players. they were as perfect in their parts as davis was in hers - they just didn't have as much to do. some of the reviewers felt that the book was so much better - it was but to give the film it's due, to condense a 600 page book down to 83 minutes is no mean feat. the first part of the book didn't even make it to the screen - it told of phillip's childhood, then moved to germany and paris, where phillip had gone to try to make good as an artist. it also chronicles his first romance - with fanny price, who kills herself when she realises phillip cannot return her feelings of love. it is a wonderful book but rambling and i think that anyone who does not think too highly of the film should read the book and will realise how good the film is.  after realising that he will only ever be a mediocre painter, phillip carey (leslie howard) comes back to england hoping to take up medicine. when out at a tearoom he meets a sullen waitress, mildred (bette davis). even though she has no interest in him and basically treats him like dirt, phillip is obsessed. it is so hard to watch his efforts at trying to find any civility in this vicious shrew. in one scene she promises to meet him in a second class railway waiting room, when they almost miss each other, she berates him with ""why would i wait in a second class waiting room when there is a first class one available"". you just want to shake him. the only time she is pleasant to him is when she tells him she is going to marry another man, a coarse sales- man, emile miller (alan hale). with mildred out of the picture, he meets nora (kay johnson) a lovely woman, who writes romantic novels under a male pseudonym. she jokes about the popularity the books enjoy among servants (in the novel he had seen mildred reading them.) nora gives phillip all the love and confidence he needs but he is incapable of returning her love. when mildred returns (miller didn't marry her and she is having a baby), of course he takes care of her and helps her with the baby (in the film it is treated as an object - always called ""baby"", never given a name or gender) - she repays him by running off with his best friend.  at the hospital he meets sally athelny (frances dee) who is visiting her sick father. he begins to visit her home and for the first time in his life gets a sense of family. then surprise! surprise! mildred returns like a bad penny and surprise! philip takes her in. but he has changed and feels only disgust when she tries to show gratitude the only way she knows how. then follows one of the most vicious, verbal fights on film with phrases such as ""you cad, you dirty swine"", ""i only kissed you because you begged me"" and ""when you went i wiped my mouth, i wiped my mouth""!!! in the book a lot of mildred's stock phrases such as ""you're a gentleman in every sense of the word"", ""i don't mind"", and ""mr. high and mighty"" were associated with prostitutes and when phillip meets her for the first time he is struck by that.  the end of the film shows phillip (being truly free of mildred in the only way possible) now free to love sally. again in the book sally tells phillip that she thinks she is having a baby but that just makes him more sure of his love. that ending, like mildred's ""sickness"" could not be in the film - even a pre-code one.  kay johnson was always called on to play sensible, believable women - which she played to perfection as she was obviously sensible herself. her nora was the woman philip should have stayed with. frances dee was one of the most beautiful of screen ingenues. she was obviously being groomed for stardom with some roles that proved she was not just a pretty face (""the silver cord"" and ""blood money"") but when she married joel mccrea her career started to peter out. her sally did not push her talent to the limits. apparently leslie howard was not very helpful to bette davis on the set - he was annoyed that an english actress was not given the part. he used to throw her her lines ""whilst reading a book off camera"". he did start to take an interest when a newspaper reported ""the kid was running away with the picture""!!!  highly, highly recommended.",1
"as low budget indies go, you will usually find that you get what you pay for, and let me just say, i didn't pay much for ""frightworld""...  writer / director: david r. williams brings us the story of an abandoned amusement park, besieged by the vengeful spirit of a slain serial killer. not a bad premise, but executed with a bevy of low budget mistakes. the camera work tries to be too cleaver for it's audience, by constantly using shaky quick-cuts to cover the fact that they really have nothing gory or scary to show us. this becomes evident right off the bat, as we are introduced to the would-be killer, and soon realize that the (acting) is the scariest thing happening... after a painfully long title sequence we are brought back to modern times, yet the acting remains the same. ""frightworld"" does generate some rather unique cinematography when showing scenery from inside the fun-house, but with an extremely long running time, it can't save the film from it's below average indie hell.  there is some mediocre nudity, but not much for gore, which is usually the saving grace for these types of movies.  fans of really bad b-movies might find something of interest here, otherwise, don't spend a lot of cash.",0

"all of david prior's movies are terrible on all counts: bad writing, bad acting, bad cinematography, no budget (the director's brother is usually cast as the male lead). but they all have incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional hilarity. the plot of almost every david prior ""film"" (as i like to refer to them) is basically the same. manly all-american commandos team up to blow up communist baddies. but unlike other cold war-era garbage such as red dawn, prior's movies are actually funny because of their over-the-top premises and acting. the best part of jungle assault is the scene in which becker (or was is the other dude?) is being summoned by general mitchell for a top-secret mission in south america. the funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something to the effect of ""this is my roommate, i trained him well"". what. you trained your roommate? and apparently this is going to be their solution to avoiding eviction.  if you can find these gems on video used anywhere, buy them. they are all funny and even funnier after a few beers. watch them with a group of your friends for a true mst3k-style experience. so far my friends and i have managed to get a hold of night wars and aerobicide aka ""killer workout"". but the one i recommend the most over them all is final sanction, with the freakish-looking robert z'dar.",0
"i guess i'm part of the silent minority who enjoyed this film. is it one of the best of the ""nightmare"" series? maybe not, but i had lots of fun with it. freddy krueger reaches his evil, wisecracking potential. since parts 4 and 5 kind of lagged the series down, i felt this so-called final installment (""new nightmare"" is the real finale) brought the series out of its slump. there are some great nightmare sequences, including one where breckin meyer plays a stoner who gets trashed, falls asleep and gets stuck in a video game to which freddy controls. this is both a highly original and hilarious sequence, especially when we see him out of the dreamscape, hopping around like super mario. and freddy belts out the funny one-liner, ""great graphics."" and since the movie was made about 10 years ago, it brought back memories when freddy started controlling the game with the powerglove. anyone who remembers the first 8-bit nintendo remembers the powerglove.   the cast is superb. lisa zane is perfectly cast in the lead. i haven't seen yaphet kotto since ""the running man,"" and i think the last time i saw that film was about 5 years ago. he's another great, underappreciated actor who possesses a powerful screen presence. and who can forget the cameos? the best one is by johnny depp (from the first ""nightmare"") playing a spokesman for an anti-drug commercial.   the 3d sequence at the end is really awesome! so for those who are looking to check this film out--please rent or buy it on dvd! hopefully all the editions come with the 3d glasses, but i'm sure the video edition has the 3d element removed.   i personally didn't see many things wrong with the film. it even elaborated on freddy's backstory. the film is a great mix of humor and scares, and the gross-out effects are terrific. could this have given better justice to the franchise? of course it could have. but rachel talalay did a fine job. and finding the perfect conclusion is easier said than done.  and in closing, i loved the montage over the opening credits. fans of the series will be delighted, and will look at it as a tribute to beloved freddy.   my score: 7 (out of 10)",1

"despite an overall pleasing plot and expensive production one wonders how a director can make so many clumsy cultural mistakes. where were the japanese wardrobe and cultural consultants? not on the payroll apparently.   a japanese friend of mine actually laughed out loud at some of the cultural absurdities she watched unfold before her eyes. in a later conversation she said, ""imagine a finnish director making a movie in fnnish about the american civil war using blond swedish actors as union army and frenchmen as the confederates. worse imagine dressing the scarlet o'hara female lead in a period hoop skirt missing the hoop and sporting a 1950's hairdo. maybe some people in finland might not realize that the hoop skirt was ""missing the hoop"" or recognize the bizarre jane mansfield hair, but in atlanta they would not believe their eyes or ears....and be laughing in the aisles...excellent story and photography be damned.  so...watching memoirs of a geisha was painful for anyone familiar with japanese cultural nuances, actual geisha or japanese dress, and that was the topic of the movie! hollywood is amazing in its myopic view of film making. they frequently get the big money things right while letting the details that really polish a films refinement embarrassingly wrong. i thought ""the last samurai"" was the crowning achievement of how bad an otherwise good film on japan could be. memoirs of a geisha is embarrassingly better and worse at the same time.",0

"i had high expectations following ""my beautiful laundrette"", ""bend it like beckham"" and (less so) ""east is east"". the histories of british asians fitting into their adopted home has had many good runs on the big screen, as well as a number of excellent tv and radio series (goodness gracious me, etc). this one falls flat. inspite of a good start it rapidly went down hill.  ultimately this was a horribly typical bbc effort, complete with strong regional accents, whacky over-acting characters, a ""those were the days"" soundtrack, and lots of ""issues"" in an attempt to be worthy.  i found myself cringing at many points during this film. the writing is predictable. every possible cliche was dragged out and aired. in fact, i have trouble thinking of any cross-cultural/cross-generational devices that could have been used that weren't. the characters were thin and cliched: the eccentric non-conformist minister; the well meaning but ultimately racist old woman; the over weight, overbearing aunt; the pushy indian parents; the working class neighbour; the 'wise' profound grandmother; the motorbike riding thug. the script was weak, with every chance to shock the audience with overt racist dialogue from the two dimentional racist white characters taken. and why it had to be set in the 70's (apart from needing an excuse for a 70's soundtrack) is a mystery. possibly it make unbelievable characters slightly more believable to people born after 1979. i don't know.  even these things aside, good acting could have carried this into respectable obscurity. instead, the usual ""bbc comedy"" suspects were wheeled out to ham it up. ""bend it like beckham"" had far better comic acting (and serious acting, in fact) than this, with a virtually unknown cast.  in summary, a lazy cliched script, over acted, in a dull predictable story. give it a miss.

"it's refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other american movie, and then be surprised when that doesn't happen. i like a happy ending as much as the next guy, but sometimes it's better to portray things in a more realistic manner, and i thought brokedown palace did this very well.  the ending, with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other, thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place, was very moving. i almost rather would have done without the last line, which proved that she didn't actually do the deed she confessed to, because that would have made the movie more about the friendship between the two girls, and less about the crime. whether she did it or not wasn't that important.  the story itself bordered on the cliché, but the actresses kept my attention with their excellent performances. very realistic, very captivating.  7 out of 10.",1

"i disliked frosty returns and this one. both of the films are absurd with poorly written characters and bad voices. the voices could have been done but frosty returns was worst than this because of the unalike snowman they drew. frosty's winterwonder land was great and so was the original heartwarming drama. the only good thing about this film was frosty the snowman was alike of the classic 60s and a funny line like when they were talking about things that are not real and then frosty walks by the window humming, whistling whatever he was doing but everything else was badly written and badly animated and i barely got the plot. i saw the dvd cover at the library about 2 or 3 years ago and the art looked crappy so i didn't pick it up until this year because the pictures on the back looked a little touching but i played this film. it was a hassle poorly art characters just like the dvd and it was just terrible about what's going on. i watched this at night and found it dull that i fell asleep on the whole thing (wait i always do that when i watch something while i go to sleep) but this movie was overall boring  overall rating: grade -c  this is like another holiday special bad rip-off in the frosty returns and this one. this one is the badly 4th sequel like home alone 4 well i thought that movie was ok but home alone 3 was great. but it's like a bad home alone 3 and 4 people hate like this. my sister didn't watch it that much because when she came into my room to watch 2 minutes and a half of it, she walked away like ""i hate the animation!"" i agree to her just like the 3rd one frosty returns. plain awful!",0

"what a fun filled, sexy movie! they certainly don't make them like this anymore. 4 sexy au pairs arrive in london and have all sorts of sexual misadventures. the tone is oddly innocent, as the considerable nudity evolves out of stock farcical situations, rather than any overt sexual desire on the part of the characters. it is only when the actresses accidentally lose their clothes that the male characters become rampant. richard o' sullivan literally gets 'randi'(sic). the film certainly betrays the origins of the softcore feature as lying in the nudie cuties and naturism films of the old school. my special interest in 'au pair girls' is that i am a huge fan of gabrielle drake. if any actress has ever looked better naked (she's slim but wonderfully curvy), or clothed, come to that (i've loved her since the original run of ufo - who else could carry off a purple wig!), i'll eat my hat.",1
"well, i get used after awhile to read comments about these movies that don't reflect my experience at all. to me, amitabh was a better villain here than in some of his most famous movies. he was a die-hard villain, a no-apologies villain. to me it was a breath of fresh air to see him in a role where his villainy isn't sort of undercut in some way.  the kid who played aryan was probably over his head with this cast. there i think maybe the director could have done better. but, to be honest, the very best part of this movie was shernaz patel. she is an unsung heroine, a true veteran thespian who is overqualified for every role she is offered. but i must say i appreciated her contribution greatly as she played virendra sahi's wife. she may be given little to do, but she does everything with total conviction. i'm sure she sailed right over the heads of most of the audience.  so if you are in a habit for settling for bollywood average, you won't get much out of this movie. but if you constantly search for something more, then this might give you some of what you've been missing.",1
"this is only a response to the yahoo who says this movie is more realistic than the classic, genre defining masterpiece, jaws. yes, brainiac, great whites(and other species of shark, bull, black-tip, oceanic white-tip, tiger)have been known to populate areas where easy prey is found. humans don't often make it onto that menu, granted, but the shark in the film was repeatedly pointed out to be exhibiting abnormal behavior. it's not like it's never happened. the odds of a killer whale destroying nearly a whole town, singling out a human nemesis, sinking several dozen thick hulled north atlantic fishing boats and knowing when certain people, all friends of the aforementioned ""nemesis"", are close enough to the water for it to reach, are so slim as to be laughable. much like this turd of a jaws knock-off. laughable. great white sharks are also known to frequently chew on boats, protective underwater cages and people on rafts and surfboards, as they look like seals from below. a shark the size of bruce(if you don't know, look it up)would be more than capable of sinking a boat like the orca(hey! that's the name of the blatant rip-off we're discussing!), as it would weigh upwards of 6,000 lbs. i could go on, but i don't need to. jaws is amazing(better acting, better effects, better music, better writing), orca is crap(blatant rip-off of jaws, lousy writing, abominable effects, most ridiculous plot this side of an olson twins flick). it doesn't take a masters from columbia university to see that. watch better movies.",0

"i can give you four reasons to see this movie:  1. four of the best filmmakers in the contemporary mexican cinema.  2. four good stories, related into a big scheme.  3. a surprisingly good cast.  4. a bitter reflexion about the biggest trouble in this country (and many others).  (possible spoilers)  alejandro gamboa opens this movie with a good story in a comedic mood about the authority practicing the extortion against regular people and still expecting to be appreciated by its efforts.   then antonio serrano gets more dramatic in the second piece with a story heir to the italian neorealism with a ""peter and the wolf""-like anecdote.  in the third story, the one that seems more independent from this series even in the context, carlos carrera tells us the story of a man being at the wrong place in the wrong moment. but after the recent lynching at tlahuac and the tradition in this awful matter at the state of mexico, this story couldn't be more updated.  and at the end, fernando sariñana returns to the dark humor in the ""grand finale"" in which he puts together the most of the characters from the past sequences in one of the better comedy pieces ever filmed. reprising the center scene from one of his previous films ""todo el poder"", sariñana gives the final lesson of the theme. and by the way, give us the scene that steals the movie with anna ciochetti making a brief striptease.  once the movie has ended, you get a bittersweet feeling about having looked at a good movie (and maybe enjoyed it) with a very painful subject. they say that in mexico people laugh at their own disgrace and this is the best example. this film is a testimony of how mexicans have learn to live in the middle of a crime state(and perhaps accepted it), between two fires: the criminals and the so-called authorities full of corruption. even this movie is a wishful thinking because almost all the good people have been a victim of crime and they don't get this unhurt. if you had an assault without a scratch then you're lucky. meanwhile, don't lose the chance to see this movie, highly recommended.  and it's a beautiful life in mexico...",1

the film had many fundamental values of family and love. it expressed human emotion and was an inspiring story. the script was clear( it was very easy to understand making it perfect for children)and was enjoyable and humorous at times. there were a few charged symbols to look for. the cinematography was acceptable. there was no sense of experimentation that a lot of cinematographers have been doing today(which quiet frankly is getting a little warn out). it was plainly filmed but had a nice soft quality to it. although editing could have been done better i thought it was a nice movie for a family to enjoy. and the organization of information was just thrown at you which was something i didn't like either but in all it was a good movie.,1

"frank tashlin's 'the home front' is one of the more lifeless private snafu shorts, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. rather than have snafu take some inadvisable actions leading to disaster, 'the home front' instead focuses on his loved ones back home and how much they have to offer to the war effort too. snafu realises he was wrong when he thought they had it easy. it's a concept with few possibilities for good gags and instead tashlin plays the risqué card more heavily, extended jokes involving strippers and scantily clad dancing girls in place of much effective comic relief. the result is a well-meaning short which has little relevance or entertainment value today other than as an historical artefact.",0
"*spoilers and extreme bashing lay ahead*  when this show first started, i found it tolerable and fun. fairly oddparents was the kind of cartoon that kids and adults liked. it also had high ratings along with spongebob. but it started to fall because of the following crap that butch hartman and his team shoved into the show.  first off, toilet humor isn't all that funny. you can easily pull off a fast laugh from a little kiddie with a burp, but that's pretty much the only audience that would laugh at such a cliché joke. next there are the kiddie jokes. lol we can see people in their underwear and we can see people cross-dressing. lololol!!! i just can't stop laughing at such gay bliss! somebody help me! but of course, this show wouldn't suck that bad if it weren't for stereotypes. did you see how the team portrayed australians? they saw them as nothing but kangaroo-loving, boomerang-throwing simpletons who live in a hot desert. but now... is the coup de grace of why this show truly sucks the loudest of them all... over-used jokes!!! the show constantly pulls up the same jokes (the majority of them being unfunny) thinking it is like the greatest thing ever! cosmo is mostly the one to blame. i hated how they kept on mentioning ""super toilet"" (which also has a blend of kiddish humor in it just as well) and cosmo would freak out. and who could forget that dumb battery ram joke that every goddamn parent in dimmsdale would use in that one e-mail episode? you know, the one in which every single parent (oblivious to other parents saying it) would utter the exact same sentence before breaking into their kid's room? yes, it may be first class humor to some people, but it is pure s*** to others.  if i'm not mistaken, i do believe butch hartman said something about ending the show. thank god! everyone around my area says it's, like, the funniest nickelodeon show ever. i just can't agree with it i think it's just another pile of horse dung that we get on our cartoon stations everyday, only worse.",0
"a good cast is appallingly wasted in this slower than molasses and haphazardly connived comedy. peter ustinov tries hard here to bring something to life but the result is a dour bore that misses all the right beats that might have made it watchable. regardless of the favorable comments here, this film is awful. badly directed. badly edited. badly acted. badly written. you need to sit through a hundred movies to come across one this bad.  the muddled and excruciatingly laggard plot concerns ustinov conning his way into an american insurance company in order to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds. how he does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he just learns his computer skills seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets, and hoodwinks computer expert robert morley into going to south america and stealing his identity).  as a side plot, ustinov romances fellow loner maggie smith, who just happens to become his secretary by chance after he gets a flat in her building. she ends up sharing scenes that have sexual undertones with bob newhart that go nowhere, while ustinov goes about grafting the money bit by bit and trying to keep one step ahead of newhart and karl malden. then he marries smith and they fly off to brazil, which has become the staple finale of almost every british caper comedy since (nuns on the run? a fish called wanda?)  the surprise twist of an ending is more laughable than everything that came before. by the end i was thinking i must be truly off my rocker to stick out drivel like this. even a cameo by cesar romero didn't help it. one of the most unfunny, poorly paced 'comedies' i've ever seen, and certainly the worst caper. don't waste your time. if you love this you need to see better films.",0
"a pot - boiler if ever i saw one. a supposed thriller borrowing from ""a time to kill"", ""silence of the lambs"", even an inverted ""in the heat of the night"" with a little reverse murder, a la ""strangers on a train"" thrown in, it fails abysmally where all the above, to a large degree, succeeded. namely, in delivering thrills. the plot seems condensed from a bigger book, making the plot developments obvious and uninvolving, while the direction lacks pace and verve. to rein in any kudos, a major twist had to be delivered along the way and here it fails palpably too. connery is clearly slowing down in his old age, barely bothering with his attempt at a us accent and besides seems too old to be the husband of hope lange and the father of those gosh - darn kids of his. he even has a father in law who seems younger than him. laurence fishburne barely gets the chance to inhabit his role and you're confused from the outset as to whether he's a bad guy or a good guy. someone once said that flashbacks shouldn't lie - they do, confusedly, here. the rest of the playing is merely average by a reasonable cast in their underwritten stereotyped roles. the supposed climax managed too, to roll by leaving me firmly entrenched in the back, not as should have been the aim, front edge of my seat. mediocre sloppy hollywood film making for sure.",0
"this is surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable and well made, with some decent gore!. all the characters are decent, and the story is quite fun, plus molly ringwald played the annoying bitch extremely well. i bought this at a pawn shop for a 1$, and it was surprisingly worth it, and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget, plus i loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy. the finale was really cool, as i loved how they defeated the killer, and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well, plus all the characters except for ringwald were surprisingly pretty likable!. it's decently made and written, and i thought it was quite creative and original at times as well, plus some of the death scenes were very impressive. this killer didn't mess around, and i loved it, and slasher fans(like myself) should really enjoy this film, plus the opening was really wicked too, with them filming the movie!. this is a surprisingly above average slasher, that's enjoyable,and well made, with some decent gore, and i say it's well worth the watch!. the direction is good. kimble rendall does a good! job here with solid camera work, using a creepy setting, good angles and keeping the film at a fast moving pace. the acting is solid!. molly ringwald plays the bitch extremely well,and i had troubles feeling sorry for her, after all she was supposed to be the heroine, she turned out better towards the end, but not by much, i'm surprised she decided to do this film, nonetheless she did an excellent job!. frank roberts is fantastic as the killer, he is menacing, creepy and had one hell of a mask, and this guy didn't mess around, he was fantastic!. kylie minogue plays a bitch very well in her small role. jessica napier is cute and does fine as the other heroine. rest of the cast are fine. overall well worth the watch!. *** out of 5",1
"ignoring (if possible) the tediously gratuitous marijuana smoking (which seems to be mandatory in australian government-funded films) the cast of this movie gives a reasonably credible performance. that's a far as it goes. the rest is simply awful. the plot's overburdened with ""wow"" symbolisms which are meant to look good on film but go nowhere. a gross example is the giant peach float, obviously left over from a town parade and donated by the local canning factory. it was just too tempting to waste what was hopefully a free, but nevertheless irrelevant, prop! the peach is given a cursory, unexplained wash-down at one stage but that's where it ends.  similarly, the contrived ""black spot"" road sign where steph's parents were killed, is intended to symbolize the eventual escape from her past, but her escape to what? she's had a pretty good deal where she was, especially considering her visual disability and the unending, loving patience and care of her understanding young female guardian.  the guinness' prize for corny melodrama, however, goes to the characterization of alan. alan successfully aspires to the noble role of trade union shop steward but ""rats"" on his fellow workers by becoming a supervisor for a wicked multi-national - hiss! hiss! as a supervisor, alan performs the boss' villainous dirty work. he implements redundancies until, surprise, surprise, the whole plant is closed and alan himself is left as a pathetic, unemployed failure. no cliché-free zones here, mate! not only this, but alan also loses the seductive steph from the most unlikely relationship you'd encounter. if you think the plot is melodramatic and didactic, don't ask about detail. what's the significance of the shaving cream on steph's seductive leg? why doesn't the hotel, where the couple makes love, eventually twig that someone's gaining illegal entry to one of its grandest bedrooms and, among other pandemoniums, the sheets are regularly soiled - quite spectacularly on one occasion. summing this movie up in one word: avoid, avoid, avoid.",0

"ok, this has got 2 be one of the worst excuses 4 a movie that i have ever had the misfortune of watching. like all other olsen twins movies with the possible exception of new york minute , this film had no story, gaping plot holes,disgustingly putrid acting and bad filming even!!!!!!!!! in case you haven't guessed yet i hate mary kate and ashley!!!!!! the only reason i watched this was because i was really bored and nothing else was on. i wonder if the twins will ever stop making the same stereotypical movies where they have an unbelievably stupid adventure in an exotic location and save the day meanwhile getting the help of two cute guys who drool over them immediately. the least they could would be to have a guy 4 1 of them or have them both falling 4 the same guy. the plot in this story was so imbecilic and just plain dumb. even a toddler could see the flaws in it.maybe they should split up and start making films individually or maybe films with a different kind of story. anyone who liked this movie was no offense-either really stupid, really artificial or has not seen any really good movie. or maybe they are really smart and just have bad cinematic choices. either way i would not recommend this movie to my worst nemesis for a good movie experience.. the only thing it is good 4 is some rib splitting laughter at the pathetic attempts to be cool. if you watch for laughs it's hilarious. basically i give it 0 or less.",0
"like the jeffersons, good times was one of the those classic american sitcoms which was never aired in the uk, not to mention it came out in the 1970s- a decade where of which i wasn't born yet.  but like most fans of the show, i watched a few episodes on you tube- and afterwards, i loved it.  the evans family are headed by james and florida- two parents trying to make ends meet, and who despite their lack of qualifications, encourage their children, who have their own aspirations in life to fulfil them and to take their chances. james was the strict but loving dad, who didn't dare hesitate in disciplining j.j, michael and thelma- should they over-step the line. whilst florida, in contrast was a fair, kind- hearted and considerate mother and loving wife, although she was in many ways similar to james, with regards to their attitudes to parenthood and family values from an afro- american perspective.  the kids were just as lively and entertaining as the parents themselves: j.j was an aspiring artist with a goofy personality and crazy sense of humour, who would often wear multi-coloured outfits, and whose 'dy-no-mite' catchphrase is as infectious and familiar as arnold jackson's 'whatchoo talking' 'bout willis?' from diff'rent strokes. michael was the smart-alec, who dreams of becoming a lawyer, whilst sister thelma had her own dreams and hopes. her verbal taunts with j.j were mostly hilarious, as was the love/hate relationship between brother and sister, which was played out extremely well by both mike evans and bernadette stanis.  over the seasons, there were a few cameo appearances made, most notably from janet jackson, debbie allen and a young gary coleman as himself! i actually prefer good times over say, the cosby show, which was an 80s show because a) i preferred the evans family over the huxtables, both in terms of a) characterisation and b)as i felt it tackled serious and difficult social issues, in a way that resonated with many viewers. it was a comedy but it was also a social commentary which aimed to highlight the lives of working class, afro- americans in 1970s america. the cosby show attempted to cater to the mainstream audience in a 'candy coated' way, as the huxtables were portrayed as blacks who easily assimilated themselves into an upper-class u.s culture we would associate whites with, whereas good times in contrast was much more 'edgier' and it was not afraid to address themes such as drug and child abuse in a realistic way. i actually found that whilst the cosby show can be fun to watch at times, it lacked that bit of 'sassiness' which good times has and of which made it trendier and cooler.  the show did jump the shark during the latter seasons, as it continued after john amos's character, james died in a freak accident (in reality, it was known at the time that john had quit good times for good. and so, his character's death was written as it is on the show). without john, the show suffered and alas, it lost a lot of its charm.  still, for a sitcom, good times ticked all the right boxes. if only they had shown this in the uk during the 80s. as it certainly is, as jj would put it, 'dy-no-mite!!'   my rating: 8 and a half",1
"let me begin by saying i am a big fantasy fan. however, this film is not for me. many far-fetched arguments are trying to support this film's claim that dragons possibly ever existed. the film mentions connections in different stories from different countries, but fails to investigate them more thoroughly, which could have given the film some credibility. the film uses (nice!) cgi to tell us a narrated fantasy story on a young dragon's life. this is combined with popular-tv-show-csi-style flash-forwards to make it look like something scientific, which it is definitely not. in many cases the arguments/clues are far-fetched. in some cases, clues used to show dragons possibly existed, or flew, or spit fire are simply invalid. to see this just makes me get cramp in my toes. even a fantasy film needs some degree of reality in it, but this one just doesn't have it. bottom line: it's a pretentious fantasy-csi documentary, not worth watching.",0
"this film lacked something i couldn't put my finger on at first: charisma on the part of the leading actress. this inevitably translated to lack of chemistry when she shared the screen with her leading man. even the romantic scenes came across as being merely the actors at play. it could very well have been the director who miscalculated what he needed from the actors. i just don't know.  but could it have been the screenplay? just exactly who was the chef in love with? he seemed more enamored of his culinary skills and restaurant, and ultimately of himself and his youthful exploits, than of anybody or anything else. he never convinced me he was in love with the princess.  i was disappointed in this movie. but, don't forget it was nominated for an oscar, so judge for yourself.",0

"major league: back to the minors (1998) ½*   starring: scott bakula, eric bruskotter, corbin bernsen, dennis haysbert, jensen daggett, written and directed by john warren 100 minutes rated pg-13 (for language and some violence)   by blake french:   	believe it or not, in the new john warren comedy ""major league: back to the minors"" there is one funny scene. it consists of a sequence where an infuriated coach throws a baseball hard into the wall behind him only to have it hit the cement and bounce back and smash him in the face. it's not much, but with the exception of a few one-liners, it's all this film has to offer...enough said.   this movie is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and badly written, but also just plain bad. even non-critical audience members will hate this movie with all that they got. it is so familiar it just isn't funny.   how many times does the same movie about sports have to be made? last years we saw this same material in ""air bud: golden receiver,"" and as bad as that film was, this is even worse. at least ""air bud"" was family oriented. ""major league back to the minors"" is too vulgar for a wholesome family to view together on a sunday afternoon. it is too childish for adults. so who is this film for? teenagers? elderly? people who are so desperate for entertainment they would rent something like this?  	the film, like many others like this, has one basic point it tries to make: teamwork conquers all. yes it does, and what a great moral to try to prove. too bad we have already seen and excepted it so many times over and over have such little talent and intelligence that their cheerleaders are men in a ballerina costumes. where the silly announcers form their own ""buddy comedy routine"" muttering one liners to themselves like ""they suck,"" ""this kids fast ball is timed with an hour glass,"" ""this guy dropped out of ball for a while to find something he lost--maybe it was his mind,"" ""somebody needs a nap,"" and ""ever see a sunset as beautiful as that play."" where the characters have such little significance to each other that we never know them by name. and where the only heartfelt lecture scene about teamwork is so unknowledgeable that it is almost funny.  	""major league back to the minors"" is so bad; it stalls its trite ending right in the middle of a good closing sequence. the good baseball team is on a comeback, they are about to win and--the power goes out. i was thinking for a minute that this piece of trash had come to a conclusion, but in reality, its false final scene exists only to add minutes to the running time. the movie basically consists of a series of unrelated sketches that throw in so many putrid jokes it is are not funny. there is another kind-of-funny line of dialogue that has a coach and a player talking to each other about why a long time outfielder is not wanted in that position any longer. the coach's answer: ""you're too old, too slow, and too fat."" the player's reaction is to die for. but that scene certainly does not make this movie noteworthy of you time, and certainly is not worth a cent of your money.   so here is another dreadful entrée into this genre of film, another that is doomed with its own script, which is failed before seen, and another which is so familiar it seems like deja vu all over again.

"i'm grateful to cesar montano and his crew in reviving the once-moribund visayan film understorey. ""panaghoy"" is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular (that claims more speakers than tagalog). the dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the philippines. downside: the corny and stilted acting of the american antagonist. the other item that i didn't appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the ""period"" costume of the same character, and above all, his bright red kit-car that i suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster. without those small yet glaring details, ""panaghoy"" would've been at least a 9 out of 10 on my rating--daghang salamat, manoy cesar! addendum: this film sure beats peque gallaga's ""oro, plata, mata"", which provided a different view of the visayas during the second world war. alos, there are some parts where the cinematography harks back to spielberg's ""the color purple"" and the storyline begins to become reminiscent of ""noli me tangere"".",1

"to call a movie like ""thinner"" bad is like calling the earth round or pauly shore un-talented. no news, but how they got that way is what people want to know.  as far as this movie.... the book was good, even if it was a little derivative of other stories from the ""be careful what you wish for"" genre. burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (constantine from tv's ""room 222"") to several pounds a day.   like i said, it starts out good, but why involve the mobster (mantegna)? why fire automatic weapons so much? why turn it into something so heavily dependent on fx? i thought it would have been much more effective if it focused more on the subtle ramifications of weight loss crazes, diseases, death, gypsy lore and such.   but no, it's not to be. remember, this is stephen king we're talking about.  and the ending... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky. in fact the whole movie talks too much, feeling it has to explain every plot turn to us. not that i expected ""the dead zone"", but i could have done without another ""pet sematary"", thanks anyway.  one star for at least trying to do a halfway decent makeup job. however, the rest of the movie is left to be... say it with me...

"this is the best emma in existence in my opinion. having seen the other version (1996) which is also good, and read the book, i think i can safely say with confidence that this is the true interpretation and is the most faithful to jane austen's masterpiece. the 1996 movie with g. paltrow is good too, it's just that it's almost like a different story altogether. it's very light and fluffy, you don't see the darker edges of the characters and if you just want a pleasant movie, that one would do fine but the intricacies of some of the plot points, such as the churchill/fairfax entanglement is so much glossed over as to be virtually non-existent. but if you want the characters fleshed out a bit, more real and multidimensional, the 1996 tv version is the superior. emma is a remarkable person, but she is flawed. kate beckinsale is masterful at showing the little quirks of the character. you see her look casually disgusted at some of the more simple conversation of harriet smith, yet she shows no remorse for having ruined harriet's proposal until that action has the effect of ruining her own marital happiness at the ending. you see her narcissism and it mirrors frank churchill's in that they would do harm to others to achieve their own aims. for emma, it was playing matchmaker and having a new friend to while away the time with after having suffered the loss of her governess to marriage. for frank churchill, it is securing the promise of the woman he loves while treating her and others abominably to keep the secret. in the book, she realizes all of this in a crushing awakening to all the blunders she has made. both kate beckinsale and gyneth paltrow are convincing in their remorse but paltrow's is more childlike and stagnant while beckinsale's awakening is rather real and serious and you see the transition from child-like, selfish behavior to kind and thoughtful adult. both versions are very good but i prefer this one.",1

"because 'cruel' would be the only word in existence to describe the intentions of these film makers. where do you even begin? in a spout of b*tchiness, i'm going to start with the awful acting of nearly everybody in this movie. scratch that. nearly does not belong in that sentence. i can't think of even one character who was portrayed well. although, in all fairness, it would be nearly impossible to portray these zero dimensional characters in a successful way. still, the girl who played katherine (whose name i purposefully don't include - i'm pretending she doesn't exist) remains one of the worst actors i've ever seen, only eclipsed by the guy who played sebastian. the story was god awful. it attempted to mirror the brilliance that was the first one but failed in so many ways. pretty much every part of it was pointless - though i will admit (grudgingly) that the plot twist was quite good it its surprise. and the ending was at least slightly humorous. but this film is up there with the worst i've seen. don't watch it. just don't. there is absolutely no value in watching it. none. it only takes away the enjoyment of the first.",0
"i saw this not too long ago, and i must say: this movie is terrible. i watch crappy movies for fun. scarecreow is not fun. scarecrow is stupid. you have an incredibly corny villain that enjoys screaming awful puns as he kills his victims(actually worse than the one contained in this sentence). he has his hard luck story that he uses to justify his killings. ""everyone picks on me. the only girl that thinks i'm not trailer-trash likes one of the guys that pick on me. i want to kill everybody. wah."" ok, i'm exaggerating. but the premise to this movie alone is enough to put it near the bottom of the list of crappy movies.  adding to what i just said, the kid's mom is promiscuous, he walks in on his mother and her current boyfriend getting it on, mom's boyfriend tells him to leave, kid refuses, insisting that he isn't going to leave his own house. boyfriend chases kid into corn field. he kills kid right in front of mom, mom screams in terror, boyfriend is like, ""omg! i didn't mean to!"" then he tells mom not to say anything to the police about it. kid was killed under a scarecrow, though. so, like any kid who gets murdered under a scarecrow, he comes back as a killer scarecrow with a vengeance. his victims ""haven't been stalked like this before..."" (scarecrow's official tag line)  to make matters worse, this movie was filmed in a whopping 8 days. that's right, 8 days. i was going to give this movie a 2, because in spite of itself, it has one or two redeeming moments. (they're spoilers, so i won't spoil it for you, if you actually want to see this crap.) i could have somewhat forgiven the bad acting, the horrible special effects, the abysmal script, and the bad camera work, but i simply have no respect for lack of effort on that level.  this movie isn't nearly as good as i'm making it out to be. if you want to see an example of how not to make a movie, or if you enjoy watching bad movies, like i do, then watch this at your own risk. everyone else should stay a safe distance away from this movie at all times.",0
"i can hardly believe i watched this again last night after more than 25 years...  some time back, i watched 6 fu films in a row... boris karloff, and all 5 chris lees. the last 2 lees, both directed (and i use that word loosely) by jess franco, were abominable. at the time, i skipped this one, remembering that, in some ways, it was even worse.  well, i watched it. never again. you know what's worse that an abominable film? a really well-made piece of s***. and that's what fiendish plot is. it is a very good-looking movie. great production design, sets, costumes, music, photography, editing, mostly good cast, some decent acting...  ...and absolutely, positively, one of the worst scripts in movie history!!!!! aaaugh!!!!! the first minute of the film is so deceptive... one might mistake this for a decent movie. and then they start singing ""happy birthday to fu""... and it goes downhill. having burt kwouk (of whom his master says, ""your face-- is familiar."") accidentally pour out fu's elixir vitae to put out a fire, resulting in his being condemned to torture, burial and having one of his ears cut off, was the closest thing to funny they had. it was like someone decided they wanted to do a ""campy"" film-- so ridiculous it would be funny. ridiculous, it is... funny... it ain't. at all.  it's sad, because it's clear in the first few minutes that someone did a lot of research into the fu manchu series in order to get so much of it ""right"". with a different script-- either a really funny one, or a dead serious one, they might have-- could have-- should have-- had a classic on their hands. a film that could have made one forget the horror of those jess franco atrocities... instead of making one want to dig them out as masterpieces, by comparison.  there was a period in the late 70's when a whole slew of classic 30's characters were revived in movies that were universally awful. buck rogers, flash gordon, tarzan, the lone ranger, charlie chan, even doc savage. i'm not sure, this one may be the worst of the lot. it took great self-control not to fast-forward over whole sections of it, especially any scenes containing sid caesar (fbi chief who was also al capone's cousin-- you see what i mean?). it isn't just that the ideas in the film aren't funny... they often make no sense whatsoever. like when they ""audition"" police officers to impersonate the king and queen, and we wind up seeing people ""audition"" dance-hall routines like singing, dancing, and riding a unicycle. how many drugs did the writers of this thing have to take for any of this to make sense to them?   as i said, a shame... and a real waste of all that talent, including that of peter sellers (who played both fu and nayland smith), burt kwouk (who'd been in a chris lee fu film in his time), helen mirren (the police woman who shockingly falls in love with the villain and damn near steals the last half-hour of the film!). i begin to wonder if anyone will ever make a ""proper"" fu manchu film, or if fans will have to settle for karloff's being almost the only one?",0
"turned out to be a classy production with what must have been a low budget. the variety of characters is amazing, from axe-wielding dwarfs to 7ft ghouls! i enjoyed the relationship between the leads, not overly sentimental but romantic enough to keep the interest going. i also enjoyed the mix of humour (which can be very easy to get wrong, too much/not enough) which meant it didn't get too dark, nor too spoofy. it was a great step up from eaves' other efforts, hellbreeder and sanitarium, in terms of storyline and production. they have a great website which is worth checking out. can't wait for bane, if the level of improvement continues, it should be fantastic.",1
"this was the worst movie i have ever seen billy zane in. i understand that this movie was mainly to showcase the new comers, who did pretty good for newbies, but over all, the movie was not believable.  with all of the gunfire, you would think the police would have intervened. even the coin being a bug on sean was stupid. the way sean suddenly realizes the coin is the bug, was not realistic.  looks like this movie was slapped together fast. poor job. get a better writer.  the count down to the end was not in sync with anything. it took longer to fight. and what a coincidence that each time billy was going to blast sean, he'd be out of bullets. once, i can believe, but not twice.   actually, billy's character was goofy. it was so stupid when sean punches him out at the end. it was like a comedy. bad! bad! bad!",0
"this is the biggest load of crap that i have seen in a long time. the last time i hated a movie so much was whilst watching ""28 days later"" and ""magnolia"". there is absolutely no point to this movie, except to see some really sick and twisted sex/rape scenes, gillian anderson relieving herself on the side of the road, and every single sentence of dialog having to use the ""f"" word at least a couple of times in it. it has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget. my friend and i eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour. we had tried to give it a chance, but nothing could save this crud. do not watch it!!!",0
this was one of the first creepy movies i ever saw...i was about 5 at the time. it scared me good! but that night i put chewing gum in one eye to be like the monster...and my mom got very upset. she had to clean my eye with alcohol and the next day my eye smelled like double mint! now that's a movie! hey for it's time it was a great movie. that head sitting on the lab counter top was as real as it got back then. and if your 5 it is very scary! kids now a days are spoiled by special effects that show too much and leave nothing for your minds imagination. your mind can imagine things more scarier than special effects!

"make no mistake, maureen o'sullivan is easily the most gorgeous jane ever, and there will never be one more gorgeous. she is visually stunning. that aside, it takes more than a beautiful woman to make a good film. this is a great film. it not only has the classic tarzan aura, but also the feel of the continuing saga. we become involved with the two white hunters who search for ivory, one of them in love with jane, the other, a roguish catalyst whose character may be one of the best defined and best examined in movie history.and these characterizations are what make this great action flick stand out as a classic. there is the uncomfortable racism which is depicted. however, the africans are depicted as individuals, and at the end, two even become more heroic than the white hunters, and stand out as such. in fact, the one not named evokes probably more sympathy from the audience than any other characters. the finale, also, is one of the reasons to enjoy this movie. the great lion attack has never been duplicated, and the horror is well implied with character reactions more so than a modern gore movie would do with graphic depiction. if i left anything out, it is because i do not want to soil the picture for those who haven't seen it. but it is everything you could want in a movie.",1
"this, i think, is one of the best pictures ever made. it's so pure and beautiful. it really touched me. i'm glad david lynch proved that a film doesn't necessarily need sfx, a twisting, complicated plot or flashy images. way to go,dave. i'd like to see cronenberg do that!",1
this was probably the worst movie i have ever seen in my life!! it was stupid there was no plot and the special affects were ridiculous!! and i have never seen such bad acting in my life! the only good part about the movie were all the hot guys(especially drew fuller). i don't know what these people were thinking when they made this movie!! i didn't even want to finish the whole thing because you get to this point in the movie where the guys are all in bed touching themselves. i mean it was like some kind of sick and twisted kiddy porn! i would advise anyone who has heard of this movie and was interested in seeing it to just forget about it and find another movie to watch! i was very disappointed!! the whole movie was a complete waste of time in my opinion.,0
"michael caine has always claimed that ashanti was ""the only film (he) did purely for the money"" as well as ""the worst film he ever starred in"". hold on, michael, weren't you in the swarm and hurry sundown? and weren't both of those films a good deal worse than ashanti? perhaps caine remembers only too begrudgingly the physically punishing demands of filming an action film in searing 130 degrees fahrenheit temperatures (the director, richard fleischer, was hospitalised as a result of sun-stroke during the shoot). what ashanti actually emerges as is not the career low-point of michael caine. instead, it is a very average chase thriller with a talented cast, exotic locations, boring stretches and a highly formulaic storyline.  dr. david linderby (caine) is a w.h.o medic who is left devastated when his black wife anansa (beverly johnson) goes missing during an aid trip to an african tribal village. linderby gradually realises that his wife has been snatched by slave traders - led by suleiman (peter ustinov) - and he sets off on a continent-wide pursuit which eventually leads to the middle east.  along the way, big stars pop in for ineffective and superfluous guest roles. william holden has a poor cameo as a chopper pilot; omar sharif displays little of his customary charm or grace as a pampered arab millionaire; rex harrison looks rightfully bored during his brief role as a helpful contact who assists caine in his quest. the film is based on a best-seller entitled ebano, by the little-known author alberto vasquez-figueroa, but the suspense that made the book so popular is largely absent in this adaptation. ustinov is charismatic as the slaver (he seems in all his movies to be incapable of giving bad performances), and caine generates believable anguish as the man who thinks he'll never see his wife again. there are occasional flashes of action, but on the whole ashanti is quite slow-moving. all in all, it is a resistible piece of action hokum - not by any stretch as awful as caine has frequently suggested, but not a very inspiring film and certainly a let-down from all the talent involved.",0
"i was eager to see ""mr. fix it"" because i'm a huge david boreanaz fan. what i got, though, was a 1-1/2 hour nap. the premise seemed enjoyable: boreanaz is lance valenteen, proprietor of a business called ""mr. fix it"", where dumped men enlist his help to get their girlfriends to take them back.  among the problems with this movie are the editing, script, and acting. although i've found boreanaz delightful in his other film roles (with the exception of that ""crow"" movie he did), this was disappointing. at times, his character was interesting and others, flat. the supporting cast reminded me of soap opera day players. i realize it wasn't a big-budget film, but some of the scene cuts and music just didn't seem right.  my advice: watch at your own risk.",0
"futz is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in new york in the 1960s (the origins of off off broadway). though it's not for everyone, it is a genuinely brilliant, darkly funny, even more often deeply disturbing tale about love, sex, personal liberty, and revenge, a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when congress wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our constitution. the story is not about being gay, though -- it's about love and sex that don't conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate. on the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any great fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger -- stifling conformity in america.  the stage version won international acclaim in its original production, it toured the u.s. and europe, and with others of its kind, influenced almost all theatre that came after it. luckily, we have preserved here the show pretty much as it was originally conceived, with the original cast and original director, tom o'horgan (who also directed hair and jesus christ superstar on broadway).  this is not a mainstream, easy-to-take, studio film -- this is an aggressive, unsettling, glorious, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget. and it just might change the way you see the world...",1

"mary pickford becomes the chieftain of a scottish clan after the death of her father, and then has a romance. as fellow commenter snow leopard said, the film is rather episodic to begin. some of it is amusing, such as pickford whipping her clansmen to church, while some of it is just there. all in all, the story is weak, especially the recycled, contrived romance plot-line and its climax. the transfer is so dark it's difficult to appreciate the scenery, but even accounting for that, this doesn't appear to be director maurice tourneur's best work. pickford and tourneur collaborated once more in the somewhat more accessible 'the poor little rich girl,' typecasting pickford as a child character.",0
"i saw this movie at the afi dallas festival. most of the audience, including my wife, enjoyed this comedy-drama, but i didn't. it stars lucas haas (brick, alpha dog), molly parker (kissed, the five senses, hollywoodland) and adam scott (first snow, art school confidential). the director is matt bissonnette, who's married to molly parker. all three actors do a fine job in this movie about 3 friends, the marriage of two of them and infidelity involving the third. it all takes place at a lake house and it looks wonderful. the film wants to treat its subject as a comedy first and then a drama, and i thought it needed to be the other way around.",0
"the concept for sarafina appears to be a sound one, that is aside from the musical perspective. it attempts to combine upbeat african music with a story describing the atrocious conditions and atmosphere that black people were forced to endure at the time the film was set. the contradictions of each of the two elements are too glaring and the film never justifies such rapid shifts between jubilation and terror. had it simply been a drama reflecting these conditions it may have been a good film, however the scenes of school children being shot down by soldiers don't exactly sit well next to the songs.   aside from the poor premise the acting isn't the best either, goldberg gives a mediocre performance as does the remainder of the cast. overall a disappointment.  3/10",0
"at first i wasn't sure if i wanted to watch this movie when it came up on my guide so i looked it up on imdb and thought the cover looked pretty cool so i thought i would give it a try expecting a movie like elephant.  once i got past the fact that i am supposed to dislike the alicia character played excellently by busy phillips, i realized what a good job this movie was doing toward setting up the relationship between alicia and deanna. alicia is so mean to deanna played by erika christensen almost throughout the entire movie but we eventually find out that they despite being polar opposites they have one thing in common besides being present at the shooting. they share loneliness and to what extent is revealed as the film progresses.  i've just got to say how much i loved this movie and was glad to see all of the positive comments about it. i couldn't even get through elephant because it just seemed to be exploiting the columbine tragedy. this movie on the other hand was compelling and realistic. busy phillips acting is off the chain!!! that is a good thing and i would love to see her progress into some more mature roles.",1
"eyes of the werewolf (1999) is a really bad movie. the premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible. i wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production. some blind dude gets some new eyes, bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf. nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature. can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out? who is that weird little troll who helps him out and what's up with that female cop? if you really want to find out, check out eyes of the werewolf!  not a bad idea for a movie. i just wished the filmmakers would have spent a lot for time in pre-production before they decided to shoot the movie.",0
"i don't remember the last time i reacted to a performance as emotionally as i did to justin timberlake's in ""edison."" i got so emotional i wanted to scream in anguish, destroy the screen, readily accept the hopeless cries of nihilism. timberlake is horribly miscast; in fact, casting him is like casting andy dick to play the lead role in ""patton,"" or nathan lane to play jesus. but that is almost beside the point.  timberlake is simply a bad actor and he would be equally terrible in any role. i used to have problems with ben affleck's acting talent, but timberlake makes affleck look like sir ian mckellen or dame judi dench. with his metrosexual lisp (read lithp), his boyish glances and emotional expressions which derive from something like ""the 25 cliché expressions for actors,"" he poisons the screen upon which he is inflicted mercilessly, and no matter how you slice it, i do not and will not buy his role as an amateur-turned-crusader-for-justice journalist. it simply will not fly.  however, timberlake alone isn't to blame for his failure. director david j. burke puts him not only in the (essentially) primary role, but also places him aside morgan freeman, kevin spacey, john heard, dylan mcdermott, cary elwes and (i'm surprised he was as good) ll cool j. i can imagine one almost physically suffering watching some of this cast interact with timberlake.  there is an upside to this of course: the moment any of these actors interact without justin there it feels like a double relief. a pleasure, if you will. freeman and spacey may not have more than 10 minutes of screen time alone together, but that ten minutes is blissful in contrast to their scenes with our so-called hero. dylan mcdermott is also a breath of fresh air.  but enough of timberlake bashing - words aren't enough in this particular case to do the trick. ""edison"" is a very, very run-of-the-mill corruption story. it's plot ranges from cliché to simply preposterous. i do, however, admire the motivation behind making it, which i interpret as an homage to films like ""serpico,"" or ""donnie brasco,"" or maybe even ""chinatown."" don't get me wrong - ""edison"" is not even in the same ballpark as these films, but i can stretch my suspension of disbelief to admire its reason for existence, perhaps to justify my sitting through it.  the script, in and of itself, features some surprisingly bad writing. yes, it has some decent interchanges, but any conversation between piper perabo (who is wasted here) and timberlake seems like it was lifted straight out of a dawson's creek episode. it's your typical far-too-glib-for-reality, let's-impress-the-audience-with-how-well-we-articulate (and fail) dialogue. this dialogue, mind you, is punctuated by great music at the wrong moments - sometimes it feels like ""edison"" wants to morph into a music video, where the emotion of the scene is not communicated through acting, but precisely through the badly chosen music and variant film speeds (read slow-motion).  thinking about it, ""edison"" is a curiosity. it's sure as hell got a cast to kill for but the performances are marred by timberlake who simply doesn't work. in film as in most art, if one thing is off, the whole thing feels off. directors must make tough choices. david j. burke missed the mark here. some of the scenes play well in and of themselves, but as a whole, they don't seem to fit like puzzle pieces from different puzzles forced into one incoherent picture. and it's not particularly an exciting puzzle to begin with.",0
"i picked this movie up to replace the dismal choice of daytime television and to go with my thirst for femme fatales. well, for the previous, it is better than daytime television....though i'm not sure how much.  it does have its points but after about the first 20-30 minutes, the good points pan out and one comes to the conclusion that they are watching a made for tv movie that was put together with not much time to make something that will hold together. in short, a terrible sci fi channel type movie.  it has its points such as the future is dirty, like ""blade runner"" showed ..... of course, this is no ""blade runner"". the captain looks, sort of feels like actor robert forster, the kind of person one might want to be around.  but unfortunately, it rather ends up feeling like a bad ""andromeda"" rehash where the muscle of the crew consists of poor copies of the smart gunners of ""aliens"", the mystic is vampire willow sexually intensified, and the new captain might as well be like jan-michael vincent running around on ""danger island"" in the ""banana splits""; he only put on the uniform with the epaulets; he's got very little right to it. all of them running around with their version of force lances inside a ship that looks very much like the 'eureka maru' as they are fighting a class of 'people' who occupy the universe and are broken up into several different tribes or sects of different evolutionary qualities.......just like the nietzcheans in ""andromeda"".  it might have a redeeming feature with michael ironside, but after a while, one gets the feeling that he took the part as a hoot! he probably had fun doing it, but it doesn't help the movie much.  it's ..... ""okay"". okay in the way that one might watch the dvd once without turning it off; if they watch it with commercials, they will probably change the channel. one might watch it once .......... but a few hours later, be wondering what it was that made them watch it all.  for me, that was the femme fatale ............. when she was fighting.",0
"i first learned of the wendigo many years ago in one of alvin schwartz's ""scary stories"" books: according to that story, the wendigo - after calling your name in the wind - drags you along, and then pulls you up into the sky and pulverizes you. while it sounds like a pretty bizarre notion, schwartz's story turned it into a fairly coherent idea.  the movie ""wendigo"" doesn't. it basically consists of every horror flick cliché: family moves to new house and strange things start happening, anyone who harms them is asking for it, and everyone had better listen to the old indian guy. i've seen this stuff so many times that i no longer bother to count.  anyway, avoid it. patricia clarkson and erik per sullivan (dewey on ""malcolm in the middle"") have done far better than this.",0
"this movie was terrible. i thought with all the some what decent actors, it would be better. don't waste your time. eva longoria parker was awful. she should stick to desperate housewives. paul rudd is becoming a b actor. the mess he made in the movie i could never be your woman was the epitome of what i'm saying. and lake bell she was cute but definitely in need of some more acting lessons. watch just like heaven with reese witherspoon...it was a tad better. or any other ghost movie. you will be grateful to not have wasted your precious time. ps i love you is also a good from beyond the grave romance! time to start watching movies rated over 7 out of 10 and listen to the people who have already seen it.",0
"i saw this at a screening last night too. i was totally blown away at how much better this movie was than what i expected. not many movies can combine dark comedy and current event drama and not have it fall apart in the conclusion.  i won't bother rehashing the plot too much because i think the less you know about this movie going into it makes it that much better. but i will say that adam sandler's performance was really refreshing and real. he was funny, and much funnier than most of his most recent comedies. don cheadle was believable as always.  this movie isn't funny like borat or billy madison but it has a good pace about it. i'd say 90% of the audience laughed for most of the film. midway through the movie slows down to address the drama end of things and does a really nice job of tying it all together.  i also thought it was really cool how instead of playing up the whole black friend/white friend thing they chose to just ignore it and focus on the relationships themselves.",1
"wasn't sure what to expect from this movie considering its amazing collection of stars and directors but in the end it didn't disappoint.  for me one of the highlights was the final episode with the american tourist speaking with a dreadful french accent (which made me feel better about mine) which was actually quite touching and a great way to wrap up the movie.  the story of the paramedic and the stabbing victim was also very moving and for pure comedy the coen brothers and steve buscemi take the award. the tom tykwer clip was also impressive although rather ambitious in its scope.  however, the bob hoskins segment was totally cringeworthy and the vampire story was completely farcical. the dialogue in wes craven's section also felt very forced and the chinatown story was completely incomprehensible.  on the whole this film is worth watching for the good bits and has a strong finish. it's not too painful to sit through the bad sections - they only last 5 minutes anyway.  ca vaut la peine!!!",1
"this show will succeed because it appeals to all adults no matter where they are in their relationship. as a man married for 26 years, i empathize with patrick warburton's character: he loves his wife, but he assumes she knows that. i also enjoy his monotone delivery; never gets too excited or too low. a nice ensemble of characters. this will be a nice addition to the monday night line-up.  i don't know how david spade will be in his role. he is best enjoyed in small doses. he also seems a little old to still be trolling for women.  i enjoyed the pilot and i look forward to seeing how the series develops.",1

"this movie is one of the sleepers of all time. i gave it a 10 rating. the story is of the famed 'bushwhackers' out of missouri that fought on the side of the south during the war between the states. the clothing they wore were authentic, the history and why they fought is very accurate and well researched. there was actually one of the battles that did not take place as they depicted... but not bad for hollywood. the actors were well cast and were either the most brilliant of actors or the director really know how to get the best from them. i suspect it was a combination of great directing, super casting to find the right people and excellent performing by the actors. not just one or two... this movie really jelled! it has action, romance, suspense, good guys and bad guys (sometimes depending on your individual perspective) and history all rolled into one movie. even has the future spiderman and jewel. and she's good!",1
"an older man touches a flower in his wife's greenhouse that seems to be wilting. he gets pricked by it, or bitten by something on it. he quickly becomes ill, and at the hospital spits out a large writhing white larva of some kind. a later attempt to resuscitate him with paddles results in a splatter of blood.  a cop is at the hospital because his partner got badly hurt in a shoot-out. somehow the cop gets paired up with one of the female doctors, as well as an entomologist who is brought in. there are several young kids wandering around the hospital, who i suppose we're supposed to find adorable, but who are extremely annoying little brats. they happen to wander into the room where the specimen is being kept, and happen to dump a growth hormone on it. horror movie logic would say they deserve to die for this, but they're never even in any danger.  the critter grows and starts breeding. people run away from it, and sometimes towards it for some reason. the hospital gets surrounded by military who are prepared to destroy everything if need be.  there are no really compelling characters in the movie, and most of the time it seems like people are searching around for the monster. it was fairly boring. clearly it owes something to the alien movies, with the monster being born inside a human and having several stages of its growth. there's also a character named bishop, and the lead actress has sigourney weaver's hair.",0
"red eye is not the kind of movie that's going to win the palme d'or, but wes craven has never been that kind of director, anyway, and his branding is a good indication of what a film-goer can expect.  the fact that red eye is a tight little, undemanding package at 94 minutes is part of its charm and an indication of craven's craft in producing lightweight, but generally enjoyable, box office fare. in fact, it's the perfect kind of movie to show as inflight entertainment, attention-holding without putting any intellectual or emotional challenges on the viewer.  overall there is a cheesy feeling to the plot, vague terrorist subplot motivation and the supporting characters, and the main section has a tv movie feel. however, there are definite elements of hitchcockian suspense, and echoes of schumacher's phone booth, which ultimately is a more sophisticated (and pretentious) play on the same idea of emotional crisis being played out suppressed in public.  for a film that focuses mainly on two people sitting in airline seats, it lives or dies on the characters and script. cillian's icy but eloquent jackson rippner and rachel macadams resourceful lisa are the main reasons the film gets carried off. not only making the dialogue zing but also giving some sort of adam's rib type dimension to their battle of 'male logic' against feminine 'sensitivity'.  in the final portion of the film craven indulges himself a little scream style as man-chases-girl-with-knife. the most surprising revelation here is what brian cox looks like after the 'just for men' treatment, his ubiqutous appearance in films as diverse as super troopers, the ring and this making him the sexegenarian version of jude law.  short haul fun.",1
"i can't stand it when people go see a movie when they know they won't like it. my mom likes violent movies, so why did she see it? she rated it just to bring down the rating. so i know that's why it didn't have a higher rating. i give it a 6/10",1
"this is possibly the worst film i've ever seen. the fact that it has a flimsy storyline is bad enough, that they've hooked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse.  i had severe doubts about the premise of this film even before i started watching, but went into it open minded enough even to accept the way that the writers saw fit to introduce elijah wood's character matt into the hooligan scene.  but the film throws up inaccuracy after inaccuracy, to the point that by the middle of the film each one makes you cringe harder than the time before.  let's clear up a few things: hooligans don't tend to virtually smash up their own pub before a run-of-the-mill league game; they don't set out to kill each other; they don't only wear stone island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). they most certainly don't, when having taken exception to a new firm member, trot off to their rival firms territory for pie and mash. and i'd love to meet the hool who would go and grass on his firm's top boy to the rival firm. (although you can scratch what i said about setting to out kill each other if one does exist).  don't get me wrong,i'm yet to see a film on the subject that doesn't contain some fantasy whims, but this is on a par with the firm for cluelessness.  i found it ironical that wood's american nemesis is morally condemned by his character for being a cocaine user, when this is part and parcel of the british hooligan scene. the film chooses not to challenge wood's morals and instead steers clear of any of the firm using coke.  i could go on, but i think i've made my point.  as for the plot, it's highly unimaginative, and i'm sure if i hadn't spent the entire film bemoaning the points, and more, made above then i would have guessed what was going on sooner than i did. and believe me, i was well in front.  i get the distinct impression this film is aimed at men, with the hope that women will enjoy the injection of emotional issues that are raised.  if i'm right, then the makers have failed completely. it's too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who knows about the scene, and i can't believe the kind of female who looks for emotive films would give a damn about any of the characters given their violent tendencies.  are there any good points? maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but i'm rarely impressed by slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight as the point is a ruck is rousing enough anyway.  there are some funny, if unrealistic moments. wood's trip to school did raise a smile for me. but a few mildly funny moments hardly make up for watching two hours of complete fabricated dross.  if you're british avoid like the plague, if only not to further develop misconceptions of the scene if you're not in the know. if you're american, you may enjoy it, as it's clearly tailored to the market. but no one can deny the plot is flimsy, predictable and ultimately over the top.",0
"ostensibly this is a z-grade dtv horror film.  but with lines like :  ""it's easy to die, i have, many times""  and  ""why are you reading that book ?"" ""because it makes the plot more interesting""  and  ""you made your way in here, now you can make your way out again !"" (after he leads a man into the basement)  (and take a listen to what they chant)  - it's not that clear what this film, made in the era known for post-structuralism, is actually about, or whether its just bad film-making. the acting is atrocious, but some actors i know, so are they hamming it up ?  an old house, cut obviously with a contemporary dwelling, is the site of murders. a (bad) film is made in the grounds and the story replays again.",0
"in answer to the person who made the comment about how the film drags on and who believed there was no purpose to the role of jess's brother here is my response:  the role of jess's brother is to provide a form of dramatic irony in the story. craig sheffer/norman could have foreseen the troubles associated with living life to the full by looking at how jess's brother turned out. there are various instances where brad pitt and his lives run in parallel, for example, when jess's brother takes craig sheffer to a disjointed bar and subsequently he finds brad pitt there a few days later. the dramatic irony was there so craig sheffer's character would have a bigger emotional turmoil at his brothers death, knowing he could have done more to prevent it and subsequently creates a more compelling mood in the film.",1
"hopefully the score has changed by now due to my brilliant and stunning review which persuades all of you to go and watch the film thereby creating an instant chorus of ""8""s, this movie's true score.  as mentioned before chris rock is the king! previous to going to see this movie i wasn't that over the top about him but now i'm banging on the doors of chris rock's website begging him to take me on as his protege. this film is truly funny, if you don't find this movie funny you really need therapy and it's humour which targets all areas of society including race(predictably), class division, love, wealth, employment, dreams, stand up comedy... the list goes on.  there was one slight disappointment for me however. this was that in going into this film i didn't realise that it was actually a remake of ""heaven can wait"" another quite good movie made in 1971 with warren beatty. as such i was quite surprised when i watched this movie and suddenly the plot began to unravel to be distinctly similar to an older movie i had watched on tv a few weeks ago.. regardless this movie is in my opinion the better version out of the two of them simply because of the different areas it covers and the fact that chris rock is funnier than warren beatty any second of any day of any week of any year of any...you get the picture.  well to the actual plot of the film.  don't spoil the experience for yourself! don't read the plot! just go and watch a movie because there have been two reviews on imdb so far that have raved mad about it, go see it because it is the funniest thing you would have seen in a long time, go and see it because it's a cinema experience that doesn't leave you grumbling ad nauseum at the cost of cinema tickets. go see it because it is a good movie!",1
"if you want to watch a good film about how women can fight back against sexual assault, then this film is not the film that you want to watch. it was a social commentary about a woman who was victimized and fights back. spoiler: rosario dawson turns the tables on her assailant. instead of using the criminal justice system, the victim resorts to using vigilantism. she in essence nullifies the judicial system. the film ""the accused"" was a much better film because the victim uses the judicial system and wins. what the ""descent"" does is telling victims of assault that they should resort to violence? is victim any better that the accuser? no!!!",0
"i think its time for seagal to go quietly into the night. what i have just seen makes all his direct to video releases in the last few years look like his early 90's smash hits in comparison.  a secret bio lab is making a new kind of drug that jacks up a human's adrenaline system to the point where they become psychopathic killers or something. somehow seagal is supposed to stop the infection or its the end of the world...or something. seagal also went through hit squads like jellybeans, every time i look up he was commanding a new face so it kinda got hard to follow character development as well i know steven's athsma prevent him from yelling at the top of his lungs but even so why is he constantly being dubbed by people who sound nothing like him? usually the films plot and action sequences can save it from being a total waste of time but this was not even close. like i said, it was more of a horror movie with a lot of blood and shank stabbing rather than straight up fighting. the problem was it wasn't really scary and seagal looked completely out of place because the infected people were supposed to have speed of light movement yet the 40 year old 280 lb seagal killed them all singlehandedly? i guess the lone highlight of the movie was the first 20 minutes where the new recruits ask seagal to come to the strip club with them.  2 out of 10",0
"the good earth is perhaps the most boring film i've seen in my life. the plot is slow and lacking. the acting is borderline comical. while i love paul muni, i can now say i have seen a film that does not do his true ability justice. the only saving grace i found with this film is it's production value. the use of hundreds of extras throughout the film creates a very believable and interesting environment. also, the beautiful effects used to create the illusion of millions of wasps sells easily and was revolutionary at the time. other than the production value i can say little else that is good or entertaining about this film.",0
"i've watched this movie a number of times, and found it to be very good. this movie is also known as ""castle of terror"", ""coffin of terror"", and ""dance macabre"". barbara steele, is her usual beautiful/creepy self. george riviere, the male lead, does a good job with his role. the whole movie is dripping with atmosphere, and there is a good deal of tension throughout. the camera angles are good and the acting, for the most part, isn't bad. this film is quite suitable for a rainy day or evening. i have the dvd uncut version, which is far superior to the edited tv version. grab some popcorn, turn out the lights, settle back and enjoy. john r. tracy",1

"after racism, rural exodus -also known as migration from the country side- is another socio-political issue of the 1960s. westside story had dealt with racism by a love feast in an artistic view. now, midnight cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. it has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away.  director john schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two new york city scums. while the handsome joe buck(voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, the poor ratso rizzo(hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny florida. accordingly, joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into florida. besides ratso helps joe to find his way to do whatever he can. they begin sharing everything in life. they share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny. regrettably as the story progresses, joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover ratso cannot see florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there.  the might is always right, and the feeble has no right in the daylight. thence, ""midnight"" gives the factual sight.  despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in midnight cowboy. every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. thanks to this, midnight cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.",1
"i like movies about ufos, which is why i recently decided to rewatch eyes behind the stars after seeing it when i was a kid back in the late 1970s. and now i'm compelled to write a review about it because i'm afraid i'll start forgetting everything about it fast. you see, even though ebts ain't bad, it's very dull and nondescript. the story is sorta interesting but flat. the actors are good but their roles are boring and a little confusing. the fx are terribly amateurish but i can overlook something like that if the movie is compelling, which, unfortunately, this one ain't.  also, there's very little violence and there's no nudity whatsoever, which makes this 1970s italian sci-fi opus a true oddity, because if there's one thing that distinguishes italian genre movies made in the 1970s from genre movies of other countries made in the same decade, it's the astonishing amount of violence and sex to be found in them. oddly enough, because of the almost complete lack of exploitive elements, ebts stands out from the rest of the pact. i don't know if this can be seen as a compliment though. personally, i can enjoy a movie without sex and violence but i think ebts needed more violence and some sex here and there to spice it up because it is so deadly dull and dry. and the special effects aren't that special.  the story itself is actually interesting. it's a combo of the x-files and antonioni's blowup: a photographer accidentally captures aliens on film during a fashion shoot in the country. the aliens know they were captured on film and they proceed to kidnap the photographer and a model, subsequently destroying any evidence of their presence on earth. the problem starts when the model meets a man at the recently abducted photographer's apartment (this taking place just before she's to be abducted herself). the man takes some of the negatives and leaves, with the aliens having no knowledge of the missing negatives. the whole story is about this man wanting to know more about the aliens and a secret spy group who want to get a hold of the negatives. the majority of the movie centers around boring political intrigue, in the spy vs spy variety. the ufo element of the story is almost unimportant and could have easily been replaced by any cold war mcguffin. but as dull as eyes behind the stars is, it does resemble the x-files a lot! i wonder if chris carter saw this movie. anyway, the best thing in ebts are the pov shots, which are creepy and effective. but the rest is almost completely forgettable, including the goofy looking aliens.  even though i've been mostly negative about this film, i sorta cherish it nonetheless. i still remember the effective ad campaign which scared me when i saw it as a kid. and i own the video. the film could have been so much more if it had been done properly. oh well...",0
"in the rapid economic development of 1990's in china, there is a resurgence of traditional chinese culture, partially due to the rise of nationalism accompanied by the increase in wealth, and more importantly, due to the sense of spiritual belonging after the collapse of the old socialist ideology in the post cultural-revolutionary era.  however, the resurgence of chinese traditional culture, namely, the confucianism, was not without disasters, because chinese are adopted the entire tradition without eliminating the bad part, and the discrimination against girls demonstrated in this film is an excellent example.  moreover, not only the part that should be discarded were inherited, the good part that was supposed to be inherited, such as the traditional opera, and its technique, such as changing face, was ignored in the resurgence, and facing extinction.  the director used this film to criticize the problem of re-embracing tradition by contemporary china and this is the deeper meaning behind the movie.",1

"there's some very clever humour in this film, which is both a parody of and a tribute to actors. however, after a while it just seems an exercise in style (notwithstanding great gags such as balasko continuing the part of dussolier, and very good acting by all involved) and i was wondering why blier made this film. all is revealed in the ending, when blier, directing claude brasseur, gets a phone call from his dad (bernard blier) - from heaven, and gets the chance to say how much he misses him. an effective emotional capper and obviously heartfelt. but there isn't really sufficient dramatic tension or emotional involvement to keep the rest of the film interesting throughout it's entire running time. some really nice scenes and sequences, however, and anyone who likes these 'mosntres sacrés' of the french cinema should get a fair amount of enjoyment out of this film.",1
"goebbels motivation in backing down was not explored. in the aftermath of stalingrad the reich had decided to go for 'total war'. this is referred to in the film. part of this was to use women in the war effort, which germany had not previously done to any great extent. an ss massacre of women would have faced goebbels with a public relations disaster of massive proportion. his preference was to make the problem go away as quietly as possible, on the basis that the jewish men could always be rounded up later. i understand the majority survived the war.  his other problem was that the 'red' berlin had never been very enthusiastically behind the nazi cause and had to be handled cautiously. again a massacre of women could have cost the nazis what mediocre level of support they had in their capital city.  it was interesting that the majority of ss uniforms showed patches which indicated that the men wearing them were not of german nationality, but were from german origins in other countries such as lithuania or latvia",1

"why oh why do people take good material and feel the need to change it some how? having read the book on which this film is allegedly based a couple of years ago, i can say that there is little if anything from the original book. i went into this film with low expectations - i knew it would have a crappy telemovie feel to it - but it even failed to meet these.  this is not a prequel - the only relationship it has with the original is the name. this is not the story of carlito brigante, it is the story of a totally different character who's been given the same name. they have just totally spat in the face of every carlito's way fan out there; adding insult to injury by casting luis guzman, who plays a crucial character in the original movie, in a different role.  what's most disappointing is that now that this film has been made no other film will be made addressing the original, untouched material of the book carlito's way - something i really would have liked to have seen. i felt the same way about chopper - they have four books as well as interviews worth of fantastic non-fictional material and could have made a brilliant biography of australia's most feared underworld figure, instead they made a ho-hum film about a deranged but strangely pathetic small time crook (though eric bana's performance was spot-on). now we will never get to see carlito's real initial rise and fall.  the three stars is because, looking at it purely as a stand-alone flick, it is not so appalling - there are some decent performances (jay hernandez is no carlito but he could be good in other roles) and the story is not too bad. even puffy combs suits his role. but they totally misunderstand the nature of the underworld at that time (i am a bit of a crime-non-fiction buff)- something which the original film and the books got right (having been written by then attorney and now judge edwin torres).  the fact is though, it's not a stand alone - it's perhaps the most disappointing prequel ever filmed.",0
"this may not be one of the best movies ever made but overall it's a very enjoyable, light-hearted piece of froth in which everyone involved seems to be having a good time. highly recommended for it's feel-good factor alone. ok, so frank sinatra's ""acting"" leaves a lot to be desired but his singing is a great redeeming feature and the songs fit in perfectly with the romantic atmosphere of the film. sinatra went on to make many more films where his undoubted acting ability shone through but in this, his first venture into hollywood, his voice, not his acting, is his main contribution to this movie. i've just watched it again on tv and it still lifts my mood as much as it did the first time i saw it many many years ago.",1

"should have been titled 'balderdash!' little in the film is true except the name of the island and the fact submarines were involved. little more than training film quality with poor camera work, muddy stock footage and perhaps the low point of stereotyping 'japs' with laughing japanese infantry, laughing japanese fighter pilots and one-dimensional square-jawed americans dying left and right. sixty years later it is unintentionally funny as an odd artifact and as an opportunity to see what is possible when the war fever is upon you. the plot and the dialogue remind me of playing guns on a summer's afternoon in my childhood, peering through the neighbor's hedge to gain a fatal advantage on my best friend steve and my little brother. in actual fact, the makin island raid was a near total failure with carlson and his men wandering around in the dark exchanging gunfire with shadows until finally, thirsty and completely disoriented, looking for someone to surrender to, before they happened upon some equally confused japanese soldiers who promptly surrendered to them! in the withdrawal several of carlson's marines ended up on another island and were abandoned! the film, of course, couldn't tell that story, not in 1943, so this bit of whimsy was fabricated and rushed into release to the beating of drums. with randolph scott, and his jaw, as colonel thorwald (carlson) leading a unit comprised almost entirely of stock caricatures, the green recruit (harry landon, robert mitchum), the grizzled veteran (j. carroll naish, milburn stone, sam levene), the country-bumpkin (rod cameron), the all-american boy (alan curtis), and scores of sneering (when they weren't laughing) 'japs'. and yet the cast nearly overcomes the material. almost. randolph scott's narrow range is well suited to his role of earnest commander and he is supported by a solid group of professionals who do their best with thin gruel. but in the end, the one-note object of the exercise wins. any pretense is totally abandoned at the close when randy scott simply looks directly into the camera and delivers a stirring (well sorta stirring) call to arms. the cast was better than this material. so was the audience. should be viewed with reefer madness and a bottle of moderately priced merlot.",0
"anyone who actually had the ability to sit through this movie and walk away feeling like it was a good film does not appreciate quality movies. this movie was an insult to watch, the direction was high school film class quality as well as the cinematography. the blair witch project had better cinematography and i hate that move with a passion! the storyline had the potential to be a very intense very good movie but it fell flat from the first 10 minutes through the rest of the movie. someone mentioned that this film was about a child's imagination, okay thats all good and fine. but they still could have done better things with this script than what they did. i mean come on, the indian in the store. did the kid look at the little idol and suddenly imagine the indian and the entire story about an indian spirit called wendigo? which they mention to the store employee and she casually says there is no one but me that works here, so you think okay creepy ghost scenario, but then she just barters for the amount on the idol and we forget about the little kid seeing this guy. that was so lame it goes beyond pathetic. the ending left you wondering not only what happened to otis in the hospital but also with the feeling of omg!!! why the hell did i just waste my time watching this!! this is a move that i recommend not to watch, there are definitely better quality films out there that won't insult your intelligence! thank god i never had to pay to see this movie, i would have demanded my money back! for those that were easily entertained by this movie.... it's very sad that you lowered your standards to this level of film making to actually say that it was a good movie.",0
"i watched grendel the other night and am compelled to put together a public service announcement.  grendel is another version of beowulf, the thousand-year-old anglo-saxon epic poem. the scifi channel has a growing catalog of inoffensive and uninteresting movies, and the previews promised an inauthentic low-budget mini-epic, but this one refused to let me switch channels. it was staggeringly, overwhelmingly, bad. i watched in fascination and horror at the train wreck you couldn't tear your eyes away from. i reached for a notepad and managed to capture part of what i was seeing. the following may contain spoilers or might just save your sanity. you've been warned.  - just to get it over with, beowulf's warriors wore horned helmets. trivial issue compared to what came after. it also appears that the helmets were in a bin and handed to whichever actor wandered by next. fit, appearance and function were apparently irrelevant.  - marina sirtis had obviously been blackmailed into doing the movie by the ringling brothers, barnum and bailey circus. she managed to avoid a red rubber nose, but the clowns had already done the rest of her makeup.  - ben cross pretended not to be embarrassed as the king. his character, hrothgar, must have become king of the danes only minutes before the film opened and hadn't had a chance to get the crown resized to fit him yet.  - to facilitate the actors' return to their day jobs waiting tables, none were required to change their hairstyles at all. the variety of hair included cornrows, sideburns, buzz cuts and a mullet and at least served to distract from the dialog. to prove it was a multi-national cast, all were encouraged to retain whatever accent they chose.  - as is typical with this type of movie (at least since mad max), leather armor was a requirement. in this case it was odd-shaped, ill-fitting and brand-new.  - the female love interest, ingrid, played by alexis peters, followed a long-standing tradition of hotties who should be watched with the volume turned completely down.  - the unintended focus of the movie was a repeating, compound crossbow with exploding bolts. it never needed to be loaded and even had a recoil when fired. it managed to shred the laws of physics, the integrity of the original legend, historical fact and plot suspense all by itself.  - hrothgar's palace, heorot, rather than being a norse long hall, apparently was designed and constructed by artisans who sank with atlantis.  - beowulf arrived at the danes' homeland in a two-masted stern-castled ship that originally was part of a set, the other two being the santa maria and the pinta.  - prince unferth observed beowulf's ship's approach using a telescope. before you could recover from that astounding innovation, you got to see the ship from his point of view. judging from the angle, the prince was in an aircraft of some sort.  - fun fact 1: in bulgaria, fire (as from a fireplace) creates light without heat. this explains why you could see the actors' breath whether indoors or out.  - fun fact 2: dark age dancing in denmark looks like slow dances i went to in the 8th grade.  - fun fact 3: you, too, can make a catapult with a timed-release air-burst explosive. but, don't expect it to actually harm anything. incidentally, beowulf was apparently a veteran of world war ii, yelling ""incoming!"" to shred any remaining suspension of disbelief.  - grendel was so upset and always in a snit because as a completely cgi creation he couldn't leave footprints. even in snow.  - grendel's mom (""hag"") was in a foul mood because she was a single mother and junior hadn't inherited her wings. recessive gene, i suppose. by the way, we can now make an educated guess that grendel's pop was probably swamp thing.  - grendel and mom chose to randomly kill, fly away with or drag away their prey based only on a close reading of the next few pages of the script.  - fun medical fact: being slammed by a mythical beast hard enough to be thrown fifty feet against stone causes slight facial scratches that don't bleed much.  - the sword of legend beowulf used to dispatch the hag was as long as he was tall and would have contained enough steel to put a second deck on the golden gate bridge. luckily the wobbling dispelled any concerns over its weight.  - best line of the movie: prince unferth had just been impaled by hag and spit a quart of blood roughly six feet. princess ingrid cradled him gently and said, ""you're going to be okay, my prince."" so much for that job at the triage clinic.  i feel better now.",0
"it was only on my second viewing, years later, that i realized two things about this movie: 1) i enjoyed it immensely, and 2) that because its execution is decidedly sharper than the premise itself warrants. i had laughed my way through the movie before it occurred to me to renew my initial protests--valleyspeak and loogies and airheadedness (even *good*-natured airheadedness) just aren't inherently funny, especially when drawn out to feature length. but though the movie's momentum does begin to sputter out towards the end, reeves and winter and sadler (and hal landon jr. in an unforgettable scene) display such a remarkable sense of comic timing throughout that even the more clumsily-scripted jokes (e.g. ted failing to recognize a certain inhabitant of hell) work as effortlessly as the witter ones (e.g. the challenge). and the teaming of winter and reeves clicks so well that the teaming of bill and ted (who spend only one scene separated in the entire movie, disaster if they're not well-matched) appears utterly unstrained.  (side note: i found the first movie to be only sporadically entertaining--sightly different comic sensibilities there, it seems.)  i give it a 7.75. surprisingly good fun.",1
"when i rented this movie i thought i was going to see a horror-movie. however, there is little horror in this typical seventies mystery-drama directed by strange james t. flocker. nice-looking matt boston carries the picture with his fine performance and the typical strange atmosphere of flocker's movies is all-present.",1
"the first time i saw this ""film"" i loved it. when i was 11, i was more interested in the music and dancing. as i've grown older, i've become more interested in the acting as well. while the first half is just a retrospective of michael's career (from the jackson 5 up to ""bad""), it was still entertaining to watch. the ""badder"" sequence could've been left out, though the kids were pretty good. ""speed demon"" and ""leave me alone"" were funny, especially when the police officer tells michael, ""i need your autograph right here"", after stopping him for dancing in a no-dancing zone. but it's ""smooth criminal"" that's the icing on the cake. joe pesci did an excellent job as the toughie (and that hair was wild). the dancing is perfect, and so are the special effects. the only thing i could have done without was the spiders. any fan of michael's should see this, if you haven't already. i give it a 10+!",1
"fantastically putrid. i don't mean to imply above that only a few people should avoid ""doc savage."" almost every demographic group would be bored by this trivial, tv-movie-quality production. it's a little like the 60's ""batman"" tv series, except it's not funny. even accidentally. you're better off taking a nap.",0
"xizao is a rare little movie. it is simple and undemanding, and at the same time so rewarding in emotion and joy. the story is simple, and the theme of old and new clashing is wonderfully introduced in the first scenes. this theme is the essence of the movie, but it would have fallen flat if it wasn't for the magnificent characters and the actors portraying them.  the aging patriarch, master liu, is a relic of china's pre-expansion days. he runs a bath house in an old neighbourhood. every single scene set in the bath house is a source of jelaousy for us stressed out, unhappy people. not even hardened cynics can find any flaws in this wonderful setting.  master liu's mentally handicapped son er ming is the second truly powerful character in the movie, coupled with his modern-life brother. the interactions between these three people, and the various visitors to the bath house, are amazingly detailed and heart-felt, with some scenes packing so much emotion it's beyond almost everything seen in movies.  with its regime-critical message, this movie was not only censored, but also given unreasonably small coverage. it could be a coincidence, but when a movie of this caliber is virtually impossible to find, even on the internet(!), you can't help getting suspicious.  so help free speech and the movie world, buy, rent, copy this wonderful movie, and if you happen to own the dvd, if there even is one, then share share share!",1
"this is a film i decided to go and see because i'm a huge fan of adult animation. i quite often find that when a film doesn't evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style, it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his styles.  this film is certainly more about style than story. while i found the story interesting (a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as blade runner and many anime films), it was a bit hard to follow at times, and didn't feel like it all came together as well as it could have. it definitely had a mixed sense of french animation and japanese anime coming together. whether thats a good thing or not is up to the viewer. visually this film is a treat for the eyes, and in that sense a work of art.  if you like adult animation, or would like to see a film that is different from most films out at the moment. i would recommend it. all i can say is that i enjoyed the experience of the film but did come away slightly disappointed because it could have been better",1
"this, for lack of a better term, movie is lousy. where do i start......  cinemaphotography - this was, perhaps, the worst i've seen this year. it looked like the camera was being tossed from camera man to camera man. maybe they only had one camera. it gives you the sensation of being a volleyball.  there are a bunch of scenes, haphazardly, thrown in with no continuity at all. when they did the 'split screen', it was absurd. everything was squished flat, it looked ridiculous.  the color tones were way off. these people need to learn how to balance a camera. this 'movie' is poorly made, and poorly done.  the plot - you got to be kidding. if i was an ss agent, i'd sue the producers. looked like the marks brothers with radios and guns. sutherland was in his '24' mode - i can see this for free. eva longoria would have been better with a little less on, and a lot more showing. as an action bimbo she wasn't much.  i couldn't see a real plot, other than douglas boinking the presidents wife. never did say why the mercenaries were trying to kill the pres. i just don't see the president of the united states running for his life in the utility tunnels of a building, like a rat in a maze. p-l-e-a-s-e.  hollywood is dead. this movie is the proof. i like 'the big screen'. have since i was a kid. many more 'movies' like this and i'll quit going. whats the matter hollywood, made so many chick flicks, forget how to make a real movie? if i owned a theater, i'd start running the old movies. the one with real actors, good story lines - and good cinemaphotography.  this 'movie' is a dog. don't waste your time or money on it. i rate this 'movie' a zero! douglas isn't suited for this role. i can over look his age, but his just is to much of a wimp to carry this off.",0
"this is an interesting little flick made in 1967, with cool jazzy twangy soundtrack music and a plot that will make you laugh...ok, it's not really stupid but it's cheesy fun. i saw many similarities between this and 'creature with the blue hand' (aka the bloody dead) and they do have the same director! scotland yard's finest is investigating the murders of young ladies at a college. seems that criminals are being let loose from a local prison to do the bidding of some evil person and then returned when their work is done. there's a nifty device hidden inside a bible that squirts prussic acid, and there's another device that is neither nifty nor clandestine, it looks like a large squirt gun and the victim must be pretty near soaked before they expire. joachim fuchsberger plays an inspector and he mostly chews gum and looks off into the distance. there's a ""monk"", and how anyone identifies this thing as a ""monk"" is beyond me, it carries a whip and dresses in a red outfit with a red hood, more of a klan member of a different color than a monk. there's all kinds of nifty devices like a fireplace hearth that goes up and down to admit the monk, and it steps right over the fire without setting his robe alight, a nifty trick right there. this is an odd combo of crime drama with goofy overtones, and while it's rather silly at times it is fun to watch. 7 out of 10, not bad....",1
"i've read all the rave reviews here and am impressed with the imagination of those who loved this film. i can't say that i found much to recommend it. the leonard cohen sound track is not only excessively heavy-handed but dreary beyond measure. the film looks authentic enough, but something's got to happen for it to work, and nothing much does: a cursory plot (not a real problem for me), not much character development, nothing thematically. it just slogs along. flawed as it is, cimino's ""heaven's gate"" has some moments of genuine wonder and is a film i'd sooner watch again. for a brilliant reconception of the west, hbo's ""deadwood"" is much superior to ""mccabe.""",0
"obviously a film that has had great influence not only on the buddy genre but action genre as well. george lucas had to be a fan of this flick as so much of his star wars series seems to a homage to gunga din. the characters that grant, mclaglen, and fairbanks play are just precursors of han solo, luke skywalker, and chewbacca. even sam jaffe's gunga din morphed into c-3po and r2-d2 and like him or not: jar jar binks.  today this film is viewed as non pc but there is a speech by eduardo ciannelli as guru the leader of the indian opposition to the british raj that could can be echoed in the sentiments of many today.   to a young boy this was a great film. three strong male leads and only a hint of romance. there was a time when young boys deemed kissing the girl in saturday matinee film was just mush. not like today when the more skin is greeted with delight. too late to lament lost innocence.  hopefully this film will not be forgotten and a few who are channel surfing will stop at tcm and catch a film with action, adventure, and a cast of thousands instead of cgi actors.",1
"this film is pure 'hollywood hokum'. it is based upon a novel called 'not too narrow  not too deep' by richard sale, which may or may not have been interesting; it would take research to find out! the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film, so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start. there is not one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic, either in terms of events or characters. it is pure hollywood fantasy in every respect. two well-known actors, paul lukas and peter lorre, are so under-used and wasted that there was no point in their being in the film at all. they must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette, hoping that the flavour will be enhanced. the film is a ponderous attempt at producing a 'morality tale', and is so corny that it is laughable. the story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in french guiana who want to escape from their french colonial prison through a jungle (very much a hollywood set jungle, with a rubber snake). naturally there has to be a woman in the story, so joan crawford hams it up as a down-on-her-luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to clark gable, one of the escaped criminals. crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high-heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh. gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions, crinkling his brow as was his wont, smirking and looking suggestively at everybody, which was his manner of acting. it is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be clark gable that surely he hasn't any time left to be a thief. (attention-seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people not see them.) the whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment. an attempt at religiosity and 'depth' is made by injecting into the story a mysterious 'angel of mercy' who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate. he helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths, helping them to find 'peace' in their last gasps. this character is played very well by ian hunter, who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge, smiles enigmatically, makes cryptic prophetic remarks, and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow. the theme is meant to be redemption. you might call it the donald duck version of 'hollywood goes moral and gets heavy'. for real depth, hitchcock's 'i confess' of 1953 shows how it should really be done. by contrast, this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of meaning were in tinsel town, and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something, all they could come up with was, you guessed it, more tinsel.",0
"i saw the german version of the movie in german television and i was really amazed. i generally like to see documentaries, but i can't remember to have seen one that is better than 'earth'. i knew some of the scenes from youtube videos that i found by random browsing. i also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores, running on the displayed high definition tvs. after seeing the movie it's obvious to me why the footage is so popular among youtube users and multimedia retail managers: it's just so awesome and spectacular that you can't help but stare on the screen, no matter if you're generally interested in nature documentaries or not.  without hesitating a 10 out of 10. for sure, there are more thrilling movies, but in regard of documentaries, 'earth' is definitely one of the best of it's genre.",1

"what makes midnight cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which joe buck becomes bonded to ratso rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both. there really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character, but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other.  this film features jon voight's finest performance and probably dustin hoffman's as well. the rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film. also, for those interested, andy warhol's apprentice paul morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene.  if you haven't seen this movie, it is essential. check it out.",1
"what we have here is a compelling piece of low budget horror with a relatively original premise, a cast that is filled with familiar faces and one of the most convincing filming locations in the history of horror films. so...could anyone please tell me why this movie is so utterly underrated??? ""prison"" is the finnish director harlin's american debut, which still counts as his best effort even though he went on making blockbuster hits like ""die hard 2"", ""cliffhanger"" and ""deep blue sea"". the story entirely takes place in an ancient and ramshackle wyoming prison, re-opened for the cause of over-population in other, more modern state penitentiaries. inside the former execution dungeons, the restless spirit of the electric chair's last victim still dwells around. the now promoted warden eaton sharpe (lane smith) was there already 40 years ago, when this innocent man was put to death, and the spirit still remembers his vile role in the unfair trial. it seems that the time for vengeance has finally arrived. viggo mortensen plays the good car thief who has to prevent an even larger body count and chelsea field is the humane social worker who slowly unravels the secrets from the past.  ""prison"" contains over half a dozen memorable gore sequences but it's the unbearably tense atmosphere that'll stick to you for certain! unlike any other horror picture from that decade, ""prison"" features an amazing sense of realism! by this, i refer to the authentic scenery and the mood inside the prison walls, of course, and not towards the supernatural murders that are being committed... even though these are genuinely unsettling as well. the film's best parts are images of realistic and tough prison-drama sequences combined with visual mayhem and shocking horror. the absolute best terror-moment (providing me with nightmares ever since i saw it at rather young age) focuses on a grizzly death-struggle involving barbed wire. haunting!! the screenplay only suffers one flaw, but that's a common one...almost inevitable, i guess: clichés! the story introduces nearly every possible stereotype there is in a prison surrounding. we've got the ugly, fat pervert with his 'cute' boy-toy, the cowardly and racist guard avoids confrontation at all costs and  naturally  the old 'n wise black con who serves a lifetime (did i hear anybody yell the name morgan freeman?) don't stare yourself blind on these clichés is my advise, as there are so many other elements to admire. the photography is dark and moist, the mystery is upheld long and successfully and the supportive inmate-roles of class b-actors are excellent (the fans will recognize tom everett, tom 'tiny' lister and even immortal horror icon kane hodder). forget about wes craven's god-awful attempt ""shocker"" or the downright pathetic cheese-flick ""the chair"". this is the only prison chiller worth tracking down! especially considering viggo mortensen peaking popularity nowadays (i heard he starred in a successful franchise involving elves, hobbits and other fairy creatures...) this true 80's horror gem oughts to get an urgent dvd-release!",1
"i'm not saying that because the production values were so low, but because it was filmed terribly. that shot of the girl washing her hair in the creek? did we really need to sit there for an overlong shot and watch her do that for 5 minutes in the same spot? it was terrible, the lighting was just plain bad. you could barely see anything and when the characters were talking, you could barely hear what they were saying. did i watch the whole movie? of course not i skipped through most of it, and i don't want to hear anyone say i need to watch the whole thing first to judge it. this film was so poorly done and executed that even by independent and low budget standards it's just plain terrible. awful movie...don't waste any time on it unless you want a good laugh, but even then it's not because of the actors ""funny"" lines, it's because of how painstakingly bad the production is.",0
"as dr. alan feinstone, corbin bernsen turns a marvelously deranged performance in ""the dentist"".  with his already obsessive compulsive tendencies in high gear, the irs hounding him, and a very suspicious acting wife; dr. alan feinstone is losing his sanity more and more each day.  when the doc indeed does realize that his wife is having an affair with the local pool boy, it sets off a string of events that lead to torture, murder, ant total mayhem! ""the dentist"" is a solid film! bernsen makes the character of dr. feinstone relatable and hateable at the same time. even though he is completely out of his gourd, the audience will still feel sympathy towards him. that my friends.....is damn good acting.  a nice solid cast of supporting actors round out this gem of a film. excellent direction, good killings and gore, and effective pacing will keep you entertained throughout the movies run.  highly recommended!",1
"first of all, i firmly believe that norwegian movies are continually getting better. from the tedious emotional films of the 70's and 80's, movies from this place actually started to contain a bit of humour. imagine.. actual comedies were made! movies were actually starting to get entertaining and funny, as opposed to long, dark, depressing and boring.  during the 90's and 00's several really great movies were made by a 'new generation' of filmmakers. movie after movie were praised by critics and played loads of money. it became the norm!  then came united...  *minor spoilers* it's just simply not funny. not once. not ever. but the thing is... we think its funny. because we're used to norwegian movies to be funny. especially with a cast like this with a few really funny comedians. but.. they neither say nor do anything funny! where's the humor? show me the humor! is it the awkward clerk played by harald eia? is it the overacting totally ridiculously unrealistic football coach? is it the commentaries by arne scheie? the movie is just not funny!  but thats not my main rant about united. that namely is the predictability. (and it is here i fear that norwegian comedies have come to a standstill since i have seen this in many other movies as well.) all the time you just know its going to end well. all characters are exactly as they are presented in the start of the movie, and everybody gets exactly what they deserve in the end. there's absolutely no room for surprises at all!  all in all i can say that i sat with a bad feeling after seeing this movie. it was the one movie that made me realize that we probably need some new blood in norwegian movie making... again!  rating: 1/6",0
"*soiler* it's fake! the whole thing is a fake! there is no ghosts or zombies, alan is a lord and his cousin or brother or half brother or something like that wants the castle and his title for himself. so he invests this overly complicated and needless pointless plan ala scooby-doo to drive alan to commit suicide. most of the movie is him picking up redheads and attacking them. he's not even killing them. he drops off to sleep and the girl vanishes and he thinks he buried them someplace. if he looked at the so-called ghost of evelyn, he could tell she was wearing gloves! my god what a waste of time. don't bother watching it, renting and if you bought it and haven't watched it yet, sell it. quickly! do yourself a favor and stay away from the night evelyn came out of the grave. i give this stinker the crap-o-lantern.",0

"this movie rates as one of my all time favourite top 10 movies. many people seeing it for the first time and knowing little about many of the themes in the movie probably won't understand why i find it so enthralling so i will try to explain...  the movie is very rich in historical detail and cultural insights, and while it has a few minor anachronisms, they are completely forgivable. the story is a retelling of the famous duel between the monk benkei and the young prince yoshitsune on gojo bridge. during the fight according to legend yoshitsune bests benkei and the monk becomes the prince's loyal retainer. this movie is a revision of that story however and involves war, dark prophecy, and political maneuvering.  one of the main themes in the movie is ""mappo"", which is the prophecy by the buddha that after 1000 years his teachings would fail and the world would fall into chaos. it was believed in heian japan, after the eruption of mt fuji and the civil war between the taira (heike) and the minamoto (genji) that the world would fall into anarchy and everything would collapse. it is a time of demons.  next you have the way in which the movie resolves the issue of yoshitsune's sword training by the tenku (raven goblins) of karuma. defeated clans often escaped into the mountains and disguised themselves as demons to scare the locals off. this is said to be where ninja clans began historically. yoshitsune's depiction in gojo nicely accommodates all of this.  then there is benkei, and the various strains of buddhism depicted, including a lot of esoteric buddhism of the shingon sect. these are all depicted quite accurately, and just to add a little extra, the movie manages to convey the power of meditation and ki energy in a way that makes it integral to the story, i.e. it uses magic realism to add an extra dimension to the film but does it in such a way as to make it tactical and menacing.  all-in-all it is filled with fascinating tidbits and rings surprisingly true-to-life for the period. the scenery and the costuming are also completely unmissable and very authentic. the soundtrack is great, very brooding and ominous. i also thought that the actual acting performances were surprisingly good. benkei is a great brooding anti-hero, shanao (yoshitsune)is depicted as a young man testing his limits and growing increasingly drunk on his own power, and tetsukichi the scavenging sword-smith makes for and interesting depiction of the ""common man"" and his less than flattering opinion of the killers who fancy themselves his social betters.  as to the plot, to see why it is so good, i really suggest you dig up an old book on japanese history and see how this retelling turns an almost lighthearted robin hood vs little john story into a gory tale of intrigue, violence and infernal karma.",1
"this movie was terrific and even with a less than convincing ending, it's still well worth seeing. the film begins as claudette colbert is about to marry robert ryan. when the minister asks if anyone has any objections, a guy jumps up and announces that colbert can't get married because she already is married!! colbert insists this isn't true, but when they investigate they find that the justice of the peace and many others remember her wedding and there is even a signed wedding license! slowly, it becomes apparent that claudette's mind is slipping and people around her seriously doubt her sanity. then, when the supposed first husband is murdered, all evidence and suspicion falls on colbert.  the film is an exciting mystery suspense film, as what i have so far described is only the first half of the movie. what follows is amazingly intelligent and captivating. unfortunately, the conclusion, though, is a bit of a let-down, as the guiding force behind all this turns out to come ""right out of left field""--and is baffling since it was so unexpected and impossible to guess based on the information given to the viewer. however, in spite of this, the film was so good, i can even excuse the limp ending. in particular, robert ryan did a great job as the ""knuckle-busting"" fiancé, though apart from him the other performances were also excellent.",1
"illudere (to delude) comes from latin verb 'ludere' (to play), so you're warned about the 'spy game' as a cruel and yet elaborate and intelligent (!) activity stemmin' from a complex and as it may appear absurd and vain personal history, whatever it may be; and yet i feel fascinated by the mechanism of treason and loyalty, the raw material of any relationship, from the personal to the social; after, many years ago, i was able to finish the book it was a revelation! at the beginning i was so bored if not for the surprising style of the writing (i really started to love le carre after that novel). the main character is not wavering at all: he has made a choice to redeem his weakness by following the path of faith to friendship and love, or is he not? after this novel you can clearly understand the darker version of green's 'our man in havana' wrote by lecarre with 'the tailor of panama'; there is no game left, there it ends either in tragedy or in a grotesque comical way, or both. there is no smiley here to upheld decent human qualities in 'the service', or at least there is no point to introduce him in this case. the bbc has done a superb work with these series from lecarre's novels: the actors are excellent, as are the locations and sets; of course the script here is brilliantly adapted. be warned though, even if someone may find it laughable, the after taste is bitter.",1
"this film is terrible. you don't really need to read this review further. if you are planning on watching it, suffice to say - don't (unless you are studying how not to make a good movie).  the acting is horrendous... serious amateur hour. throughout the movie i thought that it was interesting that they found someone who speaks and looks like michael madsen, only to find out that it is actually him! a new low even for him!!  the plot is terrible. people who claim that it is original or good have probably never seen a decent movie before. even by the standard of hollywood action flicks, this is a terrible movie.  don't watch it!!! go for a jog instead - at least you won't feel like killing yourself.",0
"needed an excuse to get out of the house while paint dried - left the movie after an hour to return and watch the paint dry.  i don't recall ever walking out on a movie before, but i really tried to stay. the script was not up to the cast and just kept ""going and going"" badly - come on! uma thurman doing this stuff? fairly lame special effects. these were older characters and actors doing superficial horny 20-something lives - just sort of annoying and wrong feeling.  this review is base only on the first hour - it might have gotten better. i just had to get home and see if the paint dried a darker shade than when it went on.",0
"why panic never got a good theatrical release is easily seen: it's much too smart, and audiences would have probably had a difficult time with it, comparing it to american beauty in its probing of a midlife crisis, and sopranos and analyze this in it's study of illegal goings-on amidst family life. though panic may seem to derive from unoriginal material, brommel's lifelike characters coupled with deft dialogue and observant direction make the film a realistic look at the undoing of a middle aged man.  william h. macy stars as alex, a hitman who works for his father's (sutherland) contract-killing business. he leads a double life, with his wife (ullman) and son unaware of his real trade. in his middle-age, he becomes increasingly disgusted with what he has done all his life. under his calm, collected facade stirs repressed resentment for his father's controlling grasp on his life. when he meets a young woman(campbell) he feels invigored and decides it's time to quit the family business.  the fact that writer/director henry brommel decided to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract-killing is disposable. he could have easily substituted it with any undesirable profession; his characters are so well-developed and believable, scenes handled so smoothly and realisticly and dialogue written so insightfully and naturally that the focus falls on macy's conflicted character rather than his job as a hitman. brommel's script feels like a shakespearean tragedy, with a definite theme of destiny running throughout.  in alex, macy creates a tragic, easily sympathetic character, and turns in yet another brooding, great performance, as can always be expected. donald sutherland is also effectively abrasive and abusive as his overbearing father, and ullman's dramatic turn as macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where her mood subtly darkens and peaks in an affecting scene of emotional confusion.  henry brommel's first feature, panic is a film that is well-crafted in its sincerity. with a first-rate cast, a plausible script, terse dialogue, and nice direction, this character-study is hopefully just a taste of brommel's aptness for creating characters that seem real.   8 out of 10",1
"this documentary on schlockmeister william castle takes a few cheap shots at the naive '50s-'60s environment in which he did his most characteristic work--look at the funny, silly people with the ghost-glasses--but it's also affectionate and lively, with particularly bright commentary from john waters, who was absolutely the target audience for such things at the time, and from castle's daughter, who adored her dad and also is pretty perceptive about how he plied his craft. (we never find out what became of the other castle offspring.) the movies were not very good, it makes clear, but his marketing of them was brilliant, and he appears to have been a sweet, hardworking family man. fun people keep popping up, like ""straight jacket""'s diane baker, who looks great, and anne helm, whom she replaced at the instigation of star joan crawford. darryl hickman all but explodes into giggles at the happy memory of working with castle on ""the tingler,"" and there's enough footage to give us an idea of the level of castle's talent--not very high, but very energetic. a pleasant look at a time when audiences were more easily pleased, and it does make you nostalgic for simpler movie-going days.",1
"""sandra, the making of a woman"" is a standout among exploitation films, and is so for two reasons: (1) an excellent, yet effortless, performance by monica gayle, and (2) the fact that gary graver was at the helm of the project. these two talents, both of whom are quite underrated, make ""sandra"" a film that should be seen.  another key element of the film's success is its realism -- there is nothing fake or ""hollywood"" about this set-in-california film. it is truly a slice of life. the modest house in which sandra lives at the beginning of the film, the simple dresses worn by the character, the scene where sandra wakes up in the morning to find uschi digart bouncing at her front door, and sandra sits on the couch without make-up, while digart tries to sell her some cosmetics, looking truly as if she just woke up (but nevertheless beautiful), the harmless weirdo sandra picks up who likes to make love with her while he wears a bra, the one-room apartment into which sandra moves --all of these elements of the film seem totally real, and as such, the viewer is drawn into sandra's little world from the beginning and immediately becomes interested in her and wants her to succeed. sandra also makes her case for free love with eloquence and dignity and she comes off with a lot of class.  this film could have easily failed in less competent hands, and could have gone off in any of the usual sexploitation directions, but the garver/gale team see to it that ""sandra"" is not only the making of a woman but the making of an excellent film.",1
"what do you call a horror story without horror and story?   this is the most irritating thing about the film: i get the feeling the writers never really decided what's actually going on in the film! it's a different thing to know it, give hints for the audience and not completely reveal it, but here, you get the feeling the screenwriters don't know it, characters in the film do not know it and audience sees that no one knows! (remember ""cube""? even that film knew more about itself.)   i've consumed a lot of 80's horror / gore films and this movie certainly has its roots deep in those films. but a lot of important things are missing. we really know nothing about the characters. they keep repeating empty lines over and over again. the story isn't really developing - it never goes anywhere. b-acting is ok in this type of horror films, but there's not much to act in the script. we don't care about the characters. there's nothing to remember about them. there's not even cheesy humor or unnecessary sex. and most importantly - no thrills, no chills.  you only get some commonly used elements of the horror film genre. they show the lordi monsters one by one but their characters don't really contribute anything for the story.  i honestly believe that this amount of story, character development and atmosphere could be achieved with minimal amount of crew and equipment. oh yeah, film makers used to do that - and more - some 20 years ago! i felt the shared embarrassment of the audience as the film ended. too bad really.",0
"i think this movie was probably a lot more powerful when it first debuted in 1943, though nowadays it seems a bit too preachy and static to elevate it to greatness. the film is set in 1940--just before the entry of the us into the war. paul lukas plays the very earnest and decent head of his family. he's a german who has spent seven years fighting the nazis and avoiding capture. bette davis is his very understanding and long-suffering wife who has managed to educate and raise the children without him from time to time. as the film begins, they are crossing the border from mexico to the usa and for the first time in years, they are going to relax and stop running.  the problem for me was that the family was too perfect and too decent--making them seem like obvious positive propaganda instead of a real family suffering through real problems. while this had a very noble goal at the time, it just seems phony today. in particular, the incredibly odd and extremely scripted dialog used by the children just didn't ring true. it sounded more like anti-fascism speeches than the voices of real children. they were as a result extremely annoying--particularly the littlest one who came off, at times, as a brat. about the only ones who sounded real were bette davis and her extended american family as well as the scumbag romanian living with them (though he had no discernible accent).  it's really tough to believe that the ultra-famous dashiel hammett wrote this dialog, as it just doesn't sound true to life. the story was based on the play by his lover, lillian hellman. and, the basic story idea and plot is good,...but the dialog is just bad at times. overall, an interesting curio and a film with some excellent moments,...but that's really about all.",1
"as a kid i thought this movie was great. it had animals, it had beautiful music, and it had my favorite actor: michael j. fox. now, i still love this movie, for different reasons. it has well trained animals that are put through various stunts and scenes that look excellent on camera. it has beautiful, well-written musical that fits the scenes perfectly, with rousing fast-paced melodies and the heart wrenching main theme, that still makes me cry. even when people hum it. and it has my favorite actor, michael j. fox.   based on a book, this is the story of three house pets, an intelligent, overly-trusting and considerably paternal lab by the name of shadow, a witty and vain - but still smart - cat with a fear of water named sassy and a street-smart ridiculously curious and slightly neurotic bulldog, chance. the three are taken to a friend's farm when their family goes away. dismayed and worried, the pets break out and plan a trip across the sierra mountains for the trip of their lives. a truly incredible journey. so what, maybe home is just over that mountain. but what if it isn't?   i suggest homeward bound for people that like the three amazing actors providing the voices for the lead animal characters, and for anyone else that ... yeah, everyone go watch it.",1
"all the talent mr. sooraj barjatya showed in his first 3 movies, i thought were all an accident because his 4th one main prem ki diwani hoon was so bad. but i have to say it wasn't an accident. this guy is talented and the way he has done vivah is just brilliant. right from the first scene it affects you. the sequences between shahid and amrita are awesome. the chemistry between these two actors gives glimpses of that between srk and kajol. as usual alok nath as the good and loving father is fantastic, so is anupam kher. but its a shahid-amrita film.amrita looks good in most scenes though shahid does look a little young to get married but he does a good job of a shy but yet morally strong groom. this movie will especially be liked by those who has gone through such beautiful moments in their life. all in all a brilliant film. hats off to mr. sooraj barjatya...",1
"first of all, the actor they have to play jesus has blue eyes... half the actors they have playing jews have blue eyes. aren't there enough brown-eyed actors out there? jesus being depicted as having blue eyes is one of my pet peeves. he was a full-blooded jew! second of all, what is it with old english-language movies that are supposed to take place in non-english-speaking countries, and everybody has english accents? (another example is david lean's ""dr. zhivago"".) aren't there enough either jewish actors or actors who can do a israeli accent? the movie often is not true to the scriptures, and so seems to doubt the legitimacy of jesus's claim to be the messiah. in the bible, when jesus is baptized by john, a voice comes from heaven saying ""this is my beloved son, in whom i am well pleased"" (matthew 3:17, mark 1:11, luke 3:22). in the movie, john the baptist says this! the screenwriter seems to be trying to portray the believers as crazy, as well. for example, in the bible, the angel gabriel tells mary she will become pregnant with the son of god (luke 1:26-38), but in the movie, we do not see or hear any angel - mary appears to be talking to a moonbeam, and when mary's mother hears her talking to someone and peeks in on her, she doesn't hear or see anyone either. also, in the movie, when jesus is speaking to the pharisees in the temple in jerusalem, he says, ""you shall not see me here again, not until you learn to cry, 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord', for i and my father are one and the same."" the correct line (matthew 23:39 and luke 13:35)is ""you will not see me again until you say, 'blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord.'"" period. jesus never claimed to be god. the movie cuts out a lot of important parts (the sermon on the mount is very expurgated), but then spends a lot of time on stuff that isn't even in the bible (a whole scene with mary magdalene talking with a john). it seems like the screenwriter, instead of wanting to do a movie version of the scriptures, wanted to make a movie about what he thinks might have really happened behind (and between) the scenes. the movie has one gem though - during the scene where jesus tells the parable of the prodigal son, at matthew the tax collector's house, i had tears streaming down my face. it is the best movie i've seen about jesus's ministry (but that isn't saying much, because the others are just terrible). ""jesus christ superstar"" is my favourite movie about jesus's last days (""the passion of the christ"" is way too graphic), though i like how ""jesus of nazareth"", instead of just ending with jesus's death, continues on and shows his resurrection.",0
"this remake of the 1962 orginal film'o the book has some very good parts to commend it and some fine performances by some fine actors - however scorsese opts toward the end for the most formulaic of plot twists and an embarrassingly overacted shakespearean demise that had me looking at my watch.  deniro is a superb actor, dedicated to giving his all in the work he does, however he needs direction to focus his talent, and this is sorely lacking in the last five minutes of the film.  gregory peck's cameo is serviceable but nothing more whilst robert michum is always fun to watch, even with as few lines as this.  nick nolte turns in a better performance than lorenzo's oil but is not on the same form as ""weeds"". joe don baker has some great lines while juliette lewis proves yet again that talent sometimes skips a generation.  some good points? the start credits(!), the first view of cody's back when doing dips in the prison, the scene where cody is attacked with baseball bats, sam bowden's decent into full-fledged panic, cody's outwardly calm but unnerving prescence.  the worst? the ""cleaning woman - but not really!!!"" part. clinging bare-handed to the underside of a car for a hundred miles at high speed. (are there no speed bumps in the us?) the ""he's dead - but not really!!!"" parts and the aforementioned rambling ending.  i may watch the original again, but i've yet to be tempted to watch the remake in four years since seeing it.",0
"about three minutes into this thing i started fast-forwarding, pausing only during the nudity (why is it that bad movies always include such good looking women?). in ten minutes i was done, and wishing i could get my money back from the rental store. the people who write these movies should be sanctioned by the mpaa. come on writers - the bad guys always get into the car with the bomb activated by the good guy's remote control! that's the way its been done since the days of the ottoman empire! also, to add insult to injury, the ""twist"" at the end was so formulaic, that it could have come from any action movie written in the past 25 years. burt reynolds was fine, but he should concentrate on real movies.  this movie is just a waste of time - run away! run away!",0
"direction must be the problem here. i recently heard john cleese speaking of working a skit for fawlty towers. he was supposed to attack his car with a branch. the first branch was too flimsy and not funny. the second branch was too stiff to be funny. the third was just flimsy enough to be funny. this sort of attention to detail is missing from ""corky romano"". no matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was, it wasn't fixed, and wasn't left on the cutting room floor. the one value i can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repaired.  i've scanned dozens of other reviews here. the number of reviews praising this absolute waste of time bolsters my suspicion that some people are getting paid to promote titles. i can't fathom how anyone over the age of 9 could rate this title more than a 4, max. i mean, come on, 5 is average. i can't imagine anyone, even those making money off of this, rating it even as much as average.  this makes my list of the 10 worst movies of all time. and, hey, i actually like the three stooges and can even tolerate ed wood!",0

(spoilers, sorta)  the acting is decent enough. the story simply isn't very interesting. the whole 'still awake' premise becomes nullified by the astral projection stuff(not kidding).   the surgery scene is initially tense, a bit discomforting, but then becomes utterly banal.  not horrible, but not memorable. terrence howard's least interesting role to date, so far as i've seen.   kind of boring, overall.",0

"i just watched this movie, by mistake. what a little gem. this film made in 1956 looks, and feels, like a late seventies movie. and is in fact better, more restrained and correct than, say, blue soldier. the environmental, anthropological undertones are way ahead of its time. the understated cinematography is superb and terribly realistic. much more than dances with wolves, the last hunt manages to convey the look and feel of the buffalo ""killing fields"" of the late 1800s. probably because those in the movie were real killing fields. the movie was shot during legal forestry directed buffalo culls, so the animals you see are really being shot, the bones are real. in conclusion, a very under-rated western masterpiece, superbly acted, directed and shot.",1

"normally when i go on a raid of the local hollywood video i head towards the b-horror movies. to me the basic principals behind a b-horror movie is it's camp value, heavy gore, lots of needless nudity, and special effects that anyone can put together with a pack of corn syrup and latex. i rented cradle of fear strictly because i've been a fan of the band since they released they're first demo in 1995. the movie started off on an interesting note and then when i saw dani filth stomp on an extremely obvious latex mask i laughed. when i saw the lesbian sex scene for the sake of a lesbian sex scene i laughed even harder. i spent pretty much the entire movie laughing and when i wasn't laughing i was shaking my head thinking about how a multi-million dollar rock star would want to make a movie that seemed like it was on a budget of multi-hundreds of dollars. the whole point of this movie to me seemed to attract the ""hardcore goth kids who think death, destruction, sex, blood, and satan are the greatest things invented since lava lamps. that was really it. to me this movie seemed like 80.5% of the things that happened in this movie just happened for the sake of being satanic. this movie had a lot of potential and really could have been a real good movie but in the end this ""movie"" really is just an extended cradle of filth video.",0

"on the 28th of december, 1895, in the grand café in paris, film history was writing itself while louis lumière showed his short films, all single shots, to a paying audience. 'la sortie des usines lumière' was the first film to be played and i wish i was there, not only to see the film, but also the reactions of the audience.  we start with closed doors of the lumière factory. apparently, since the image seems a photograph, people thought they were just going to see a slide show, not something they were hoping for. but then the doors open and people are streaming out, heading home. first a lot of women, then some men, and one man on a bike with a big dog. when they are all out the doors close again.  whether this is the first film or not (some say 'l'arrivée d'un train à la ciotat' was the first film lumière recorded), it is an impressive piece of early cinema. being bored by this is close to impossible for multiple reasons. one simple reason: it is only fifty seconds long. but also for people who normally only like the special effect films there must be something interesting here; you don't get to see historical things like this every day.",1

blank check is one of those kids movies that could have been a great suspense thriller for the kids but instead it's a tired lame home alone ripoff that isn't worth a dime. quigley is a criminal who just escaped from jail and gets his hidden million dollars from a big score and then we meet preston a frustrated kid whose room is taken over by his brothers to start a business and obviously dad treats his brothers better because they make money the same day he goes to a kid's birthday party and since his dad is a cheapo he goes on little kids rides while the other kids go on roller coasters then he receives a birthday card and a check of 11 bucks how cheap is this family? so he goes to the bank to open an account and meets the gorgeous shea stanley were her parents mets fans? he finds out he needs 200 to open a account meanwhile quigley gives his million to his banker friend and finds out the bills are marked so he will send a lackey named juice to get the unmarked ones when preston leaves his bike gets run over by quigley he's about to write a check when he spots the cops and bolts back home his parents scolded him about his busted up bike and gets grounded what? their kid got almost run over and they worried about a bike? so preston forges a million dollar check via his computer and comes back only to be escorted to the banker thinking that he's juice he gives preston the money but the real juice came and realized they been duped by a kid! so preston buys a mansion under the name macintosh gets a limo driver who says unfunny jokes and goes on a epic shopping spree then he spots shea and talks about opening his account kid you're loaded and you're talking about opening an account? we soon realized shea is actually an fbi agent tracking down quigley and his two other accomplice's then he told his cheapy dad he's got a job working for mr macintosh and spends the day riding go karts playng vr games and hanging out with his limo driver buddy then he goes out on a date with shea in a fancy restaurant what a 10 year old wining and dining a 20 something fbi agent? afterwards he takes her to a street geyser and playing around in the water messing up shea's 300 dollar dress yet she takes it well if this was a bit realistic she would slap him for messing up her expensive dress so quigley and the others still mad interrogates a little kid and quickly spills the beans and preston is being chased by quigley in a scene taken from the original script and afterwords he is hosting mr macintoshs birthday which is really his birthday when he discovers he couldn't pay for the party he sits in his chair and dad talks to macintosh which he doesn't know it's his son he's talking to and talks about preston should be a real kid and has his whole childhood ahead of him and wants preston to go home early what? an hour ago you were grilling him about his finances! so preston asks everyone to leave and sits alone pondering when quigley and the others break in to the house to make preston pay and so he faces then in a finale that rips off home alone quigley gets spun around in a ball while preston is driving a go kart juice gets hit in the groin and more antics ensue until the trio get preston cornered and when it seem all hope is lost shea and a bunch of swat guys come to save the day and so quigley and his crew get sent to jail but is there any hope for preston and shea? there is and she kisses him in the lips what? what? what? a grown woman kissed a kid in the lips. come on is she mentally disabled? i mean an fbi agent who knows the country's laws would risk her career to kiss a kid? she could get arrested on the spot! and the most creepiest part of all is that isn't goodbye and she'll see him in 6 or 7 years! oh dear and so he comes home to his family celebrating his birthday so the moral of the story is love and respect can be bought? what are they smoking? the bottom line is that is a waste of time the morals are whacked it's flat as a tortilla the kid is annoying the villains are lame the comic relief isn't funny the brothers are unlikable the dad is even worse the romantic subplot is creepy the plot's shallow and the only saving grace is the cinematography from bill pope which went on to shoot the matrix trilogy and two of the spider-man films so people don't waste your money and go watch home alone instead.   this has been a samuel franco review.,0
"i very nearly walked out, but i'd paid my money, and my nearly-as-disgusted friend wanted to hold out. after the endearing, wide-eyed innocence of ""a new hope"" and the thrilling sophistication of ""the empire strikes back,"" i remember awaiting ""return of the jedi"" with almost aching anticipation. but from the opening scene of this insultingly commercial sewage, i was bitterly disappointed, and enraged at lucas. he should have been ashamed of himself, but this abomination undeniably proves that he doesn't have subatomic particle of shame in his cold, greedy heart. episode i would go on to reinforce this fact -- your honor, i call jarjar binks (but please issue barf bags to the members of the jury first).  from the initial raising of the gate at jabba's lair, this ""film"" was nothing more than a two-plus-hour commercial for as many licensable, profit-making action figures as lucas could cram into it -- the pig-like guards, the hokey flesh-pigtailed flunky, that vile muppet-pet of jabba's, the new and recycled cabaret figures, the monsters, etc., etc., ad vomitum. then there were the detestably cute and marketable ewoks. pile on top of that all of the rebel alliance aliens. fifteen seconds each on-screen (or less) and the kiddies just gotta have one for their collection. the blatant, exploitative financial baiting of children is nauseating.  lucas didn't even bother to come up with a new plot -- he just exhumed the death star from ""a new hope"" and heaved in a boatload of cheap sentiment. what an appalling slap in the face to his fans. i can't shake the notion that lucas took a perverse pleasure in inflicting this dreck on his fans: ""i've got these lemmings hooked so bad that i can crank out the worst piece of stinking, putrid garbage that i could dream up, and they'll flock to the theaters to scarf it up. plus, all the kiddies will whine and torture their parents until they buy the brats a complete collection of action figures of every single incidental undeveloped, cartoonish caricature that i stuffed in, and i get a cut from every single one. it'll make me even more obscenely rich.""  there may have been a paltry, partial handful of redeeming moments in this miserable rip-off. i seem to recall that harrison ford managed to just barely keep his nose above the surface of this cesspool. but whatever tiny few bright spots there may be are massively obliterated by the offensive commercialism that lucas so avariciously embraced in this total, absolute sell-out to profit.",0
"roommates sugar and bobby lee are abducted by menacing dudes while out shopping one day and taken back to a secluded island that the girls reluctantly tell the thugs that they last visited when they were ten years of age and that a fortune is located on. all that just pretty much bookends a movie that is pretty much one long flashback about the girls first visit to the island and subsequent fight with a cannibalistic family.  this one is extremely horribly acted by everyone involved to the point that i started feeling bad for poor hank worden who truly deserved much much better. as much as i didn't like ""barracuda"" (that's on the same dvd) i have to admit that this film makes that one look like citizen kane.  eye candy: one pair of tits (they might belong to kirsten baker)   my grade: f   dark sky dvd extras: vintage ads for various drive-in food; and trailers for ""bonnie's kids"" (features nudity), ""the centerfold girls"", ""part-time wife"" (features nudity), ""psychic killer"", & ""eaten alive"". the dvd also comes with 1978's ""barracuda""",0
"i've seen a slew of ""80s rocker horrors"" over the years, from rubbish like ""terror on tour"" to ridiculously fun gems like ""slumber party massacre 2."" somehow i managed to keep putting this one off, which is strange because it's probably the most popular and well received one. well, i finally caught up with it and it's easily the best of this mostly awful (but almost always endearing!) subgenre. the plot (which was pretty much lifted in the film ""black roses"") concerns a mulleted misfit named eddie, whose ridiculed by all in his high school for his taste in music. he loves 80s metal, especially his idol sammi curr (played by the late great tony fields.) after sammi is killed, eddie favorite radio dj gives him sammi's final recording. once eddie plays the record backwards, he discovers he's a bit tougher, and bad things start happening to those who taunt him. is sammi's music possessed? ""trick or treat"" is well-made and a total hoot. the special effects are awesome, even though it does feature the typical 80s laser beams. i grew up in the 80s, and while i wasn't a fan of heavy metal, i do remember the urban legend about playing a record backwards hearing the sounds of satan worshipping. haha! i also remember being told by my older siblings and neighbors that both kiss and ozzy worshipped satan, so it's very amusing to see them both make cameos as a harmless radio dj and a anti-rock priest. if only i had seen this film as a kid! while the film seems to poke fun at the popular connection in the 80s between alleged devil worship and heavy metal, the viewer never really finds out why sammi curr is back from the dead creating havoc and killing whoever gets in his way. this is movie's weakest point, but if you can overlook that, it's loads of fun.",1
"the main problem with the documentary ""czech dream"" is that isn't really saying what it thinks it's saying.  in an audacious - i hesitate to use the word ""inspired"" - act of street theater, vit klusak and filip remunda, two student filmmakers from the czech republic, pulled off a major corporate hoax to serve as the basis for their movie: they deliberately fabricated a phony ""hypermarket"" (the eastern european equivalent of costco or wal mart super store), built an entire ad campaign around it - replete with billboards, radio and tv spots, an official logo, a catchy theme song and photos of fake merchandise - and then waited around to see just how many ""dopes"" would show up to their creation on opening day. they even built a makeshift façade to convince people that the store itself actually existed.  one might well ask, ""why do such a thing?"" well, that's a very good question, but the answer the filmmakers provide isn't all that satisfying a one. essentially, we're told that the purpose of the stunt was to show how easily people can be manipulated into believing something - even something that's not true - simply through the power of advertising. and the movie makers run for moral cover by claiming that the ""real"" (i.e. higher) purpose for the charade is to convince the czech people not to fall for all the advertisements encouraging them to join the european union. fair enough - especially when one considers that the actual advertisers who agree to go along with the stunt declaim against the unethical nature of lying to customers, all the while justifying their collaboration in the deception by claiming it to be a form of ""research"" into what does and does not work in advertising. in a way, by allowing themselves to be caught on camera making these comments, these ad men and women are as much dupes of the filmmakers as the poor unsuspecting people who are the primary target of the ruse.  but, in many ways, the satirical arrow not only does not hit its intended target, it ironically zeroes right back around on the very filmmakers who launched it. for it is they themselves and not the good-hearted and naturally trusting people who ultimately come off as the unethical and classless ones here, as they proceed to make fools out of perfectly decent people, some of them old and handicapped and forced to travel long distances on foot to get to the spot. and what is all this supposed to prove anyway? that people are ""greedy"" because they go to the opening of a new supermarket looking for bargains? or that they're stupid and gullible because they don't suspect that there might not be an actual market even though one has been advertised? such vigilance would require a level of cynicism that would make it virtually impossible to function in the real world.  no, i'm afraid this smart-alecky, nasty little ""stunt"" only proves what complete and utter jerks the filmmakers are for making some really nice people feel like idiots. and, indeed many of them, when they finally discover the trick that's been played on them, react with a graciousness and good humor i'm not sure i would be able to muster were i to find myself in their position.  i'm not saying that the movie isn't gripping - something akin to witnessing a massive traffic accident in action - but, when the dust has finally settled and all the disappointed customers return red-faced and empty-handed to their homes, we can safely declare that they are not the ones who should be feeling ashamed.",0
"inspired at least a little by ivy benson & her all girls orchestra, who performed throughout the war years at the covent garden opera house, this film chronicles the attempts by an elderly saxophone player to reform the (almost) all girl band with whom she played as a schoolgirl towards the end of wwii. all too brief flashbacks to the original band on stage bring us some wonderful music, and help to fill in the background to the band members, and in particular to the girls' relationships with the lone male member - their transvestite drummer (who is trying to dodge the call-up).  ian holm (""lord of the rings"", ""cromwell and fairfax"") and judi dench turn in superb leading performances as the recently widowed elizabeth, and the conniving, womanizing patrick, the drummer. the late joan sims is perfect as the band's leader, now playing bar piano at the sea-side, and june whitfield glows as the salvation army trombone player. cameo appearances by other greats like cleo laine, leslie caron, olympia dukakis and billie whitelaw make this an unforgettable experience. the movie is a romp down memory lane, with an all star cast of what ought, by all rights, to be a bunch of over-the-hill actresses. all i can say is, i hope i look as good at their age! leslie caron, in particular, is still an incredible fox, at 69 years of age. she certainly still gets my pulse going! as i watched it, i was mentally berating the casting director for not using women of the appropriate age. afterwards, i looked these girls up, and discovered that every one of them is old enough to have been performing in the london of 1944 (although this might be a bit of a stretch for judi dench).  if you like swing bands, thrive on nostalgia, or just want to see how good a woman can manage look with almost three quarters of a century behind her, don't miss this film.

"some critics found this film bleak, but for me there was enough good humour and optimism to overcome this impression. for example, the quietly positive and stoic character of the daughter is the still centre of the film, often counterbalancing the unhappy aspects of the setting and plotline.  the film is full of original ideas and characters, and the final outcome is not predictable: i felt it could've gone either way.  by the way, many reviews i've read mention the effective use of black and white, but the print i saw, shown on the sbs tv network here in australia, was in full colour.

"i wanted to watch this movie, but one bizarre ridiculous scene after another forced me to shut it off. character's don't seem to react to anything. consider this: heath ledger is walking a night (through a cemetery i believe) when he is attacked by spirits, which he drives away. once past this ordeal he calmly walks away and meets up with a friend that saw it all. when asked what happen he says blandly ""attacked by demons, nothing serious."", as if this is only a little more exciting than a flat tire.  i shut it off when they go to ask something-a demon or something, i stopped caring-a ques ion. the answer can only be rented out of someone with the energy of their death, and the priest watch in what appears to be vague annoyance as a man is strung up and hung and they ask his thrashing, dying body question.  0 out of **** stars.",0
"i've seen my fair share of badly thought-out endings and final twists to films, but i don't recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did.  the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would 'surprise' us all.... and it did, but perhaps not in the way the directors had hoped. i was left feeling surprised that connery, harris, fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey, individually or collectively.  the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall. but once the twist was revealed, the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable, the underlying motive for revenge was ill-conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far-fetched. what's worse is that, once the twist was revealed, the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable.  harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he never gives a bad performance, even if the movie ain't that great! so all in all, it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested. the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema.",0
"i have to agree with some of the other comments and even go a step further.   nothing about this film worked, absolutely nothing. delmar our central character makes the decision to become a surrogate mother in order to earn enough money to buy a restaurant but along the way fall for a wise ex-jailbird. at the same time her friend hortense is trying to get her lawyer boyfriend to finally marry her. she also happens to be sleeping with marlon who is desperately in love with her. then there's delmar's brother jethro who gets involved with a former coke addict, missy who reveals she was sexually abused by her adopted father. on the sidelines we also have the eccentricmother who has an assortment of equally odd friends, one of whom dies on the couch at the beginning of the film. so far so good but after introducing these characters and story lines addressing life, death, grief and love in the first half, the film simply loses direction.   if the writer had only selected one or two characters and allowed us to follow their stories maybe things would have been fine but equal screen time is given to all with the result that no one story or character is fully developed. for instance, why does delmar think she will be able to hand over her child in exchange for money, especially when the prospective parents are a creepy bigoted lawyer and his semi alcoholic and depressed wife? why is hortense so desperate to marry a man who is a jerk and clearly doesn't love her? how is it missy manages to kick her coke habit overnight? is jethro regularly drawn to women with overwhelming problems, or is missy the exception? has delmar and jethro's mother always been on the eccentric side, or is it a more recent development? why is jethro so keen on cadillacs that he has one in the middle of his living room? why did moses spend years in prison for stealing a car, a relatively minor crime? how does delmar manage to end up giving birth to moses' baby when there is no suggestion that they ever had sex?   these questions are posed in the screenplay but sadly are never answered. i can only assume they were answered in the original novel and that is why the writer felt the need to include it all in the script. big mistake. losing several subplots especially the hortense and marlon story, which adds nothing to the overall film, would have tightened things considerably and allowed more time to develop the delmar, jethro and moses characters who are clearly more central to the plot and underlying themes than anyone else.   add to that the most pedestrian directing style seen outside of the average soap opera and the result is a huge missed opportunity for all, including jorja fox who does her best to rise above the material. i'm not surprised that this appears to have been the director's last film as this effort shows no evidence of a visual style or ability to tell a moving and intelligent story.",0
"my take: a goofy, yet imaginative mess.   keanu reeves (yes! that keanu reeves) and alex winter return as the two punk-rock idiots in this sequel to the time-trotting adventure comedy bill and ted's excellent adventure, now a cult classic. in this sequel, bill and ted are given much more to do than travel through time. they might as well travel heaven and hell too! during the beginning of this sequel, bill and ted are preparing for a ""battle of the bands"" competition which may make them more famous than ever. meanwhile, many years in a futuristic civilization, the time-wizard from the first film (the always watchable george carlin) is running a university praising bill and ted's names. there, an evil tyrant (joss ackland, from the hunt for red october) plots to get rid of the two idiot rock-stars once and for all. so he sends two identical android replicas (in the words of bill and ted: robot us's) to do the dirty job.  there after, bill and ted experience death and must find their way through hell, with inhabitants that happens to include the duo's worst memories, and then through heaven in an attempt to get back to earth to save their girlfriends... and their show. along this whacked-out voyage, they play board games with none other than death (william sadler, from die hard 2), reminiscent to a similar moment in the 1957 foreign film classic the seventh seal, aid help from a couple of intelligent alien beings and more.  bogus journey's array of exuberant special effects gimmicks aren't up to to-date standards, and even some of the humor and the for-the-time look and feel are somewhat dated (to be honest, the film also feels like it was released on the wrong year, even for the 90's). but with it's no little lack of imagination and a lively turn by both the performances and direction, bill and ted's bogus journey is fun, imaginative, and yes, bogus.  rating: ***1/2 out of 5.",1
"seriously, the fact that this show is so popular just boggles the mind. this show isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't original, it's just a steaming pile of bull crap. let me start with the characters. the characters are all one-dimensional morons with loud, exaggerated voices that just sound like fingernails on a blackboard. the voice acting could've been better. then there's the animation. my god, it hurts my eyes just looking at it. everything is too flat, too pointy, too bright, and too candy coated. then there's the humor, or lack thereof. it's completely idiotic! they just take these b-grade jokes that aren't even that funny in the first place and then repeat them to death. they also throw in some pointless potty humor which sickens me. and finally, last and least, the music. it's just plain annoying. it sounds like it was composed on a child's computer and generates no emotion whatsoever. i wish there was a score lower than 1, i really do. this show seriously needs to be canceled. it's a show i try to avoid like the plague. whenever i hear the theme song i immediately turn the tv off. if you've never watched this show then don't. watch quality programming like the simpsons or futurama.",0
"given the chance to write, direct and star in my own movie, i would probably choose something about robot women with guns. anthony hopkins, however, decided to make possibly the strangest movie anyone has ever seen. ""slipstream"" is a movie that is so strange that even david lynch would probably look at the person next to him and say 'what's going on?'.  this is a movie where, in one scene, a man crosses the road towards a yellow car facing to the right which suddenly changes into a pink car facing to the left. this is a movie where two characters have a conversation interspersed with shots of random people laughing and insects climbing up walls. this is a movie where a man starts talking about ""invasion of the bodysnatchers"" only for the actor of that particular movie to suddenly show up as himself (and then disappear into thin air).   this is a movie that decides to throw the need for a coherent plot straight out of the window and use fifteen different edits whilst doing so, as well as changing from black and white to colour for seemingly no reason at all.  i must, however, commend mr hopkins for his choice of actors in this movie (some of whom portray multiple characters). all of those involved throw themselves into their roles, even if they probably have no idea what they're actually doing. my favourite here was christian slater's thug in a hat who was impressively menacing whilst babbling nonsense and singing the american national anthem.   anthony hopkins has been quoted saying that he did this movie as a joke and that's possibly the best way to sum up ""slipstream"". it's a joke on the audience. you'll watch it from beginning to end, trying to understand what is going on and hoping that the answer will come, only to discover that the answer never actually does. what the punchline to this particular joke is, only anthony hopkins will ever know.  i mentioned david lynch earlier and i'm a big fan of that particular director. i would guess that anthony hopkins shares my love for the likes of ""twin peaks"", ""blue velvet"" and ""lost highway"". however, ""slipstream"" isn't as satisfying as any of the movies of lynch despite imitating many of his techniques (although i was surprised to discover that nobody talks backwards in ""slipstream""). it's far too chaotic and random - as another reviewer here pointed out, it's the movie version of alzheimer's disease. no doubt there are a small number out there who are able to watch this and draw something from it. unfortunately for the rest of us, ""slipstream"" quickly becomes an annoying and confusing experience that was only made due to hopkins' involvement.  watch at your own risk.",0
"i watched this on the movies with my girlfriend at the time and i can say that i didn't have the best time mainly because i didn't know about ned kelly or his story.  but since this is a biopic, it's important to at least know what to expect from the character.  i don't know if the manner the events are told are true, or if it everything is fictional. but the way ned kelly is portrayed as a hero and a fighter for justice really makes me want to believe everything is true. i don't think he's portrayed as a redneck criminal or thief, but that's just my opinion.  this is a solid western-type movie for everybody's tastes. heath ledger is great as always and the sexy naomi watts charms the screen.  give this movie a chance if it airs on cable. otherwise, i don't think i could recommend it.",1
"i actually prefer robin williams in his more serious roles (e.g. good will hunting, the fisher king, the world according to garp). these are my favorite robin williams movies. but seize the day, although well-acted, is one of the worst movies i've ever seen and certainly the worst robin williams movie (even worse than death to smoochy, club paradise, and alladin on ice).  every good story is going to have its ups and downs. this movie, however, is one giant down. i don't need a feel-good hollywood cheese-fest, but i've got to have something other than 90 minutes of complete and utter hopelessness. this movie reminds me of ""love liza"" (which is actually worse) because it seems that the only point of the movie is to see how far one person can fall. the answer? who cares.",0
"salvage: 4 out of 10. groundhog day meets a christian coalition horror film. okay maybe it's not that bad. but it is close.  claire (played by alicia silverstonesque lauren currie lewis) is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer (chris ferry who is quite menacing and brutal). i say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream.. or was it? (cue music)  the basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot (done quite well the first time) is repeated over and over again. and since claire wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality i just stopped caring what happened to claire and started wondering what lame twist at the end was going to pull this together.  i was rooting for a séance (which honestly would have made more sense) but instead got one of those too obvious by half surprise endings (think the village or below) yup the film collapses faster than donnie darko's directors cut. all the great twist endings in horror movies the sixth sense, the original invasion of the body snatchers, happy birthday to me worked because the audience wasn't expecting a left field explanation. (heck even the canoe ending in the original friday the 13th was worth a jolt)  salvage on the other hand screams twist ending with every scene change. other nagging faults is the one note piano soundtrack (though the featured songs were decent) the obvious time padding (claire doing the dishes, claire's mother's subplots), the way claire says ""hello is anyone there"" every time she thinks there is a serial killer around.  also some of the secondary acting roles (in particular claire's mother played by maureen olander who resembles a mary kay zombie) shows the first time actor low budget roots.  both too clever by half and not nearly clever enough salvage keeps your interest if only to see how they are going to fix this mess. problem is they really don't.",0
"personally, i absolutely love this movie and novel(i read the book first and decided to see the movie). first of all the plot is truly original and one of a kind. the acting is also great and i love the cast. judd crandall (plays fred gwynne) fits his role perfectly and really sells it to you. there are also a few corny lines thrown in there (idk if they were meant to be corny), but they really will lighten up the mood and provide a good laugh. the maine atmosphere is really a perfect spot to film this movie and it kind of draws you in throughout the movie. not only will you love it but you'll want to see it again and again, i recommend this 100% to any horror fan!!",1

"first of all, when people hear 'guy ritchie', they immediately think of snatch. yes, snatch was a good movie, but the problem is that everyone associates guy ritchie to snatch. they don't expect him to explore new frontiers. this movie revolver is different than snatch; it's much darker and is very complex. the reason i gave a rating of 10 is because i've had to watch revolver 3 times to understand everything. so this movie toys with your head. it's very cleverly written.  this movie is different than snatch. it was done wonderfully, the cinematography is beautiful, and you can recognize guy ritchie's personal touch (style of directing) in it.  what won me over was the complexity of the protagonist and how we are left with more questions than answers.",1
"i had been looking forward to how to lose friends & alienate people for months, particularly due to the fact that kirsten dunst and simon pegg were starring. simon pegg is a comedic genius and kirsten dunst has always been a favorite actress of mine. how to lose friends & alienate people hit the spot! of course not perfect, but very enjoyable and funny. how to lose friends & alienate people follows the life of sidney young, a smalltime, bumbling, british celebrity journalist, who is hired by an upscale magazine in new york city. in spectacular fashion sidney enters high society and burns bridges with bosses, peers and superstars. after disrupting one black-tie event by allowing a wild pig to run rampant, sidney catches the attention of clayton harding, editor of sharp, and accepts a job with the magazine in new york city. clayton warns sidney that he'd better impress and charm everyone he can, if he wants to succeed. instead, sidney instantly insults and annoys fellow writer alison olsen (kirsten dunst). he dares to target the star clients of power publicist eleanor johnson (gillian anderson). he also upsets his direct boss lawrence maddox (danny huston). sidney finds creative ways to annoy nearly everyone. his saving grace, a rising starlet sophie maes (megan fox) who develops an odd affection for him. in time, allison's friendship might be the only thing saving sydney from his downward spiraling career. the storyline is very interesting and the acting was top notch with what the actors were given. simon pegg is still hilarious as ever! he makes sydney bumbling, obnoxious, and annoying as real as it gets, but later in time making sydney not just likable, but also a real character who you root for in the end. kirsten dunst and jeff bridges were brilliant! kirsten had some very wonderful acting and hilarious scenes, and jeff bridges is just jeff f*cking bridges! how can you not like him?! he makes clayton a very humorous character with some wit and overall you just love the guy. gillian anderson, megan fox, and danny huston were great as the supporting cast. each had their own personality that were overall pretty unlikable, but that's what just made the film work. one thing i didn't enjoy was how one dimensional some of the characters were. i understand that most were the supporting cast, but some of the cast was underused and could've given the film some more spice to it. how to lose friends & alienate people will never be on anyone's top 10 films ever, or even top 10 comedies ever, but it has a very high entertainment level and some scenes may even charm you as well. how to lose friends & alienate people is definitely one of the better romantic comedies of the year! 8/10",1
rajkumar santoshi without any doubt has directed the greatest movies and biggest box office hits of indian cinema.  this movie falls short of all expectations as this movie stars two great actors mr. amitabh bachchan and akshay kumar and when you have these two actors in the same movie you have to make a magnum opus.  in the later part of the movie you can make out that amitabh bachchan's voice has been dubbed by some other person which was due to his illness.  still the movie did'nt had proper character development plus cinematography was'nt good too and one thing that bollywood should learn is that they should use visual effects only when it is needed and when applied should be done with a high budget.the script had so many flaws which gives the viewer excuses to attend his phone calls rather than watching the movie.  the new comer shakes the leg well but could not act well but where the movie loses big time is the storyline screenplay and cinematography.  a talented actor like bhoomika chawla has been wasted in the movie as well as sushant singh.  but every director once in a while in his career makes a bad film.  so watch it only if you are a fan of multi-starrer flop movies.,0
"this game was really great and quite a challenge. it has a great, spooky story line and the graphics are also very good. i would recommend this game to all horror fans and is very gripping from start to finish. the only problem with this game is that i would have liked more weapons but thats just me.   a truly great game for rpg and shoot'em'up fans.  >",1
"what an insult to olivia d'abo who plays the film's heroine, robin, to have keanu reeves appear so large on the box art of the film (and at least on recent reissues, to have only reeves appear on the box), considering that she was the star. i realize that it is his name that will ultimately sell this long-forgotten after school special, but at least give the woman some credit.   despite that, this has to be one of the worst teen sports-themed films that i have ever seen, and it strives very hard to add not only every teen and sports movie cliché from the class warfare between the feuding gymnasts to the teen romance. and, in striving to somehow deliver itself as an amateur alternative of flashdance (with the music in one of the warehouse dance scenes is even quite close to michael sembello's notable 'maniac' which was made famous by flashdance, or was it the other way around?). it includes similar dance sequences and worse yet, even the 80s dance and sports traditions of corny dance-offs between the heroine and her antagonist(s), the one who doubts her successes and abilities on the team. we saw this in trashin' (a vert ramp joust) and rad (bmx dancing at the prom, although it wasn't much for competition, but rather for fun) for example. in fact, this movie is chock full of unrealistic corniness, such as the somewhat homo-erotic rolling in the clothes at the salvation army with robin and her friend from the team.  nonetheless, the film is about a young girl who comes from a rather poor background. to top it off in a massive need to squeeze from audiences as much sympathy as possible, she lives with her ailing mother, her obnoxious sister, and her careless (and slightly abusive) stepfather. needless to say, homelife is not so appealing. add to the mix, a talent for gymnastics, but several obstacles to joining the team (including the nuisance of her arrogant, snobby teammates, and a coach who also eventually doubts her abilities to compete well). and, of course, we can't forget that she's got eyes for one of the pretty boy preppies who is dating one of the obnoxious teammates, nor that she doesn't have a steady boyfriend (although keanu as tommy later enters the picture). could this kid be any more pathetic? and it seems that one mess after another comes along to embarrass herself in her painfully long, redundant, and clichéd quest to prove her worth to everyone.  but, even the major moments of cheesiness which comprise most of the film, are hardly worth mentioning considering that the biggest distraction to this film is the horrible acting and dialog. (i like how the gym coach suddenly appears at the diner in the middle of the dance-off to scold the teammates). it makes episodes of 'amazing stories' look like shakespeare.  i imagine anyone able to locate this film and watch it these days is probably drawn to it mostly because of the nostalgic factor. for that you might be satisfied, but it is also an incredibly forced drama. so, caveat emptour.",0
"i've seen this film in avant-premiere at imagina festival in monaco.  i saw the first trailer four years ago, and from this moment, i was waiting to see the final result. i haven't been disappointed.  it is a full 3d movie with a high contrasted black and white render. clearly inspired by some comic books, such as the ones from f. miller. in this optic, it goes one step further than the excellent ""sin city"" adaptation from r. rodriguez. this time, (almost) no grey or any middle color, but a graphic style never seen before in a realistic animated film.(can't wait for scanner darkly)  the massive use of motion capture gives a lot of life and credibility to the characters and we forget really soon the technical aspect to concentrate on more classic elements, such as direction or plot. the direction stays sober and controlled despite the infinite possibilities of the medium, and that is a really good surprise.  the futuristic story (paris 2053) makes it a classic sci-fiction movie and maintain the viewer interested till the end. despite a classic base plot (an investigation that goes far beyond initial expectations)the atmosphere and some interesting recurring themes (genetics, absolute power of certain firms...)gives this movie a great interest.  despite it is an animated film, this one is obviously not made for children. you won't find here any funny pet or any stupid family moral, only the cold reality. it is far closer to a good film noir.  i found that the setting is one of the best aspect of the film: we still feel the well known paris, but it is morphed by a fine touch of futurism.  nevertheless, i regret a few mistakes. the montage is sometimes a bit flat, one or two very cliché slow motion effects and some poor dialogs. even though the technical is excellent, it shows its limits in some romantic sequences (a bit like ""final fantasy"" did). those little things makes it a 7/10.  altogether, it is a successful artistic challenge that you have to watch if you can. the director, christian volckman, knows how not to fall into potential traps (luckyly, they didn't ask john woo to do the job!).  to conclude, it is a film with blasting visuals, an intelligent story and a wonderful art direction. watch it if you can!  please excuse me for the spelling mistakes.",1
"this is really really bad. lamas shows just how a second rate actor does his job. but what makes it worth watching is the scene where oj angrily grabs a fellow cop by the throat as if to kill them while the jukebox plays a song with the lyric ""i got the evidence on you!"". (makes me want to hear the rest of the lyrics - attributed to david gregoli and leslie oren but i couldn't find it on itunes). talk about seeing into the future...too funny for words. the rest of the movie is forgettable. the score and songs are more interesting than the script. ditto the sequel. which begs the question of why they would do a sequel at all. my understanding was that foreign sales drives a lot of these b movies. doesn't say much for the world's viewing habits.",0
"next to ""star wars"" and ""the wizard of oz,"" this remains one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. it's a true shame it's not as well-known as the former films (maybe because it sticks to a story based on legends rather than contemporary or sci-fi settings, and that it's british, meaning a smaller market for films) but its wonderful to know that it's deserved that reputation.  like all great family films, one can be a child, an adult, or even a teenager to enjoy this film (i'm currently 18), but one must appreciate classic films first. i absolutely adore this film. it has an extraordinary music score by miklos rozsa (perhaps my favorite classic film score) that rivals any john williams ""star wars"" score, a fast but not flashy pace, beautiful sets, dialog, and use of color (both the sets and cinematography won oscars), and state-of-the-art oscar-winning special effects (for the time, and some are still stunning). and, of course, june duprez's sultry looks as the princess rivals that of catherine zeta-jones' (she even looks like jones in a way!).  in conclusion, this is one of my all-time favorite movie (next to ""the adventures of robin hood"") and it truly deserves more attention. it is a true adventure of enchantment throughout, and, along with ""robin hood,"" it's my desert island film that i could watch over and over again without getting annoyed.  stars: **** (excellent)",1
"go see this movie for the gorgeous imagery of andy goldsworthy's sculptures, and treat yourself to a thoroughly eye-opening and relaxing experience. the music perfectly complements the footage, but never draws attention towards itself. some commentators called the interview snippets with the artist a weak spot, but consider this: why would you expand on this in a movie, if you can read andy's musings at length in his books, or attend one of his excellent lectures? this medium is much more suitable to show the ephemeral nature of the artist's works, and is used expertly in this respect.",1
"i am not going to lie. despite looking interesting, i watched the notorious bettie page because i had heard (and it was fairly obvious just by looking at a synopsis or anything about the film), that gretchen mol got naked in it. i have never been a fan of mol, but i cannot resist seeing an attractive woman taking off her clothes. yes, that may be perverted, but its a theme and ideal central to the very core of the movie, and helps to make the film a lot stronger than it probably should be.  the film chronicles bettie page's (mol) life from her physical and sexually abused days as a kid in high school in the south, and onto her new life in new york. she wants to be an actress, but she has to pay bills too. after taking a few seemingly innocent shots on a local beach, page slowly becomes a modeling sensation, and quickly jumps from suggestive photos to sexually provocative pin-up photographs.  i feel the briefness of the film (just over ninety minutes) is both a curse and blessing for it. on one hand, the film never overstays its welcome. you get to know page within a few short minutes, and then it gets right into her modeling career and does not look back. but it curses the film as well, because we never really get a chance to grasp everything that is going on. she just kind of jumps around between modeling shoots and the controversies that they create before jumping right into the major senate investigation that takes up much of the final act of the film. you just sit there, and attempt to absorb it all, and more just comes right at you. it feels like the filmmakers wanted to summarize too much material in too short a film. it begs for longer sequences, and begs more for even longer explanations. it does not feel rushed; it just does not feel all there.  another bit of a fumble, although a bit more of a curiosity, is the use of colour throughout the film. the majority is in black and white, but frequently, splashes and sequences of colour do emerge. but while this may have been done as a symbolic gesture early on, it becomes a bit of a distraction as it continually pops up later on before cutting back to black and white. it gets confusing, and becomes more of a tedious interference than anything else as the film goes on.  while it may fumble a bit with the actions, the film stays dead-on with its themes. page, who i know little to nothing about, is played off innocently, and her world is exactly the same. save for a few shady characters during her teenage years, everyone she encounters is an innocent, and everything she does has an innocence to it. i never thought i would look at full frontal nudity as being something that was anything other than vulgar and depraved, but here, it truly is something to marvel at. all at once, it is beautiful and innocent. even the most sexually perverted moments in the film (albeit tame compared to today's standards) have an innocent and angelic feeling to them. there is just something about the way mol's nude body is portrayed that it just strikes at such a different chord than nude bodies in other films. it just feels so natural and so wondrous, that if there were any reason to watch the film, it would be to see the spectacular depictions of mol's body as she plays bettie page.  the other reason is mol herself. as page, she exemplifies that 1950's southern belle everyone knows (or can at least imagine). despite her profession, she is still a normal person, and still looks at herself as being religious. mol plays her exactly to the right amount of squeaky-cleanliness needed to make this character feel authentically from the 1950's. she plays her with such matter-of-factness that you would be hard-set not to think that mol was actually bettie page herself.  unfortunately, the supporting cast have very little moments to shine, and are totally overshadowed by mol's wonderful performance. none of them do anything particularly pleasing, and none of them really have that same strength in their role as mol does. this is not really the fault of the actors, but more of the fact that they do not have much to work with. many of them are totally recognizable, such as oscar-nominee david strathairn (in a role a little too close to one of his better performances), sarah paulson (recent golden globe nominee for studio 60 on the sunset strip), and character actor lili taylor, but you would be hard set to really place their performance in being anything other than okay. none of these characters are really developed, and they really just stand as character cut-outs who mol runs loops around as she picks up steam in her brilliant performance.  really, this film is worthwhile for its portrayal of nudity, and for gretchen mol's excellent performance of bettie page. everything else is a bit too muddled and awkward than it should be. had more work been done to develop supporting characters and not just blast right through the story, this film would have been a much better biographical film. as it stands, it is just a vehicle for mol to really rise into the stratosphere of popularity as an actress.  7/10.",1
"dripping with symbolism and filled with marvelous cinematography, extase is so much more than the erotic drama we've all come to expect. this is almost a silent film, with what dialogue there is in german, and highly simplified german at that. perhaps the filmmakers intended the film to reach the widest possible european audience, as anyone with even a little high school level deutsch can easily dispense with the subtitles. the story is of little importance anyway, with the film succeeding on a cinematic level, not a narrative one. symbols of fecundity and the power of nature overwhelm the human characters--there are even scenes where flowers obscure the face of supposed star hedy lamarr--and there are moments here that will remind viewers of the works of dreyer, vertov, and riefenstahl. if the film has any message to convey, i think it's a political one: bourgeois man is timid and impotent; working class man is a happy, productive creature; and woman is the creator, destined to be unfulfilled until she has borne a child. this blend of soviet socialist realism and national socialist dogma doesn't overwhelm the film by any means--it's a beauty to watch from beginning to end--but it does place it in a very distinct artistic era. and, oh yeah, hedy does get her kit off.",1
"a stunning realization occurs when some sort of phenomenon takes place!! be it, firecrackers going off, witnessing a robbery, a hurricane nonchalantly devastating everything in it's path, or, for that matter, any other spectacular occurrence !! in the case of the maclean family, however, reveille was something which was no more complex than their day to day lives..montana in the early twentieth century was an environment which was rough and tumble...the maclean family was comprised of four people, the father, a minister, who was ideologically driven to raise his family properly. his wife was god fearing, and dutiful. the two boys were, well...boys!!.. what else can you say?...brad pitt starred in this film before he was really the!! brad pitt, and his acting performance in this film was, to say the least, remarkable!!!.. his brother, norman, was the cerebral type, he was touched by emotions that were genuine, and motivated by a set of values that missoula, montana concurred with!! paul (brad pitt) was a misfit from the offset, and lived on the edge...you would think that montana in the 1920's had no such thing, yet somehow, gambling, drinking, and violent confrontations, were as much a part of paul, as was his fly fishing rod!! fly fishing!! did i say that? parenthetically, this was the core of this movie's theme!! the recreation of fly fishing served as the cohesive bond which homogenized the kindred spirits of the maclean brothers, and to a lesser degree, the father!! i would describe the acting in this film as incredibly believable, and the cinematography went beyond sensational.. put it this way, anyone who sees this film will want to live in montana.. breathtaking filmography of bluer than blue mountains and streams captured the youth and effervescence that the maclean brothers had for life...seldom in a film do you witness whereby feelings immediately invoke a dogged tenacity to accomplish whatever it may be that someone wishes to accomplish..the maclean brothers lived life to the fullest, and for better or worse, the father knew that this was going to be the only way the two of them could become men!!...robert redford directs this film, and tells the story of the maclean's through the perspective of the older brother, norman...norman gets offered a position at the university of chicago at age 26, and marries the woman he will always be in love with...what this film also points out, is that the younger brother, paul, has attained an accomplishment of his own by being the epitome of a remarkable fly fisherman!! the seedier side of life prevails in the younger brother's existence, and exerts an insidious form of consternation for the maclean family!! as most human shortcomings go, the maclean family made light of turbulent waters, (literally) and thus, established unity as a family, by putting necessary blinders on!!!  the end of the movie ""river runs through it"" presents an epigram of life through the eyes of the older brother.. for norman maclean, stoicism is a prerequisite to perseverance in his emeritus years!! such a fate is largely due to the fact that reflecting on his life is tantamount to yearning for people who have passed away! the fond memories of his brother, his wife, his mother, and his father, must now be viewed philosophically!! for norman, his life has been relegated to stubborn facts that have determined his dubious outlook, and precarious resolve! something as simple as the statement ""this was your life, and that is how you lived it"" is a somber recollection of the joy, the sorrow, the regrets, and the love, he gave, as well as was the recipient of!! best put in the last sermon he heard his father give, his father said ""we can completely love someone without completely understanding them"".. whether you agree with what has happened in your life or not, it happened nonetheless! norman maclean must come to grips with the fact that his life has been fragmented by misunderstandings! norman maclean has become a decrepit octogenarian who is polarized by virtual conclusions to his life!! the murky waters of montana's picturesque rivers serve as a vicious and desultory finalization to his years on earth!! without question, the very prolific statement of ""what seems complicated is really very simple"" purveys a very acrimonious message in this movie...more simply put...the people and places which were important in norman's life, are now only a bittersweet memory....merely a painfully intellectual rumination of events which are aggravated by the haunted waters of montana's beautiful streams and rivers...to which, for the entire maclean family, ""all things merge into one and a river runs through it""",1
"surely no saturday morning tv kids' show was ever done this poorly. after all, those producers had to count on the audience coming back. well, in this awful offering, they could at least count the money they saved on sets. the script could have been a reject from some long-forgotten space opera serial, with a few smarmy lines added for cool-dude gerald mohr to murmur to naura hayden. no director could have done anything decent with such a loony storyline, so the action just plods boringly along. the spaceship props are absurd--a bulova wall clock and portable typewriter, for example--but the planet sets have got to be some of the worst in cinematic history. most are crude drawings, and it's all bathed in an often misfocused red light. even mohr's bare hairy chest is used as a prop. and it's a bad one--as rib-thin as the plot. any viewer who can make it to the end of this movie will hear a message from the martians--and will probably agree completely!",0
"pickup on south street (1953), directed by movie maverick samuel fuller, contains a stunning opening that establishes a double complication. subway rider candy (susan peters) collides with pickpocket skip mccoy (richard widmark dipped in shades of sinatra cool). she's unaware that she carries valuable microfilm; mccoy is unaware of grifting it. both are unaware of being observed by two federal agents. thus the grift sets in motion a degree of knowledges. candy is doubly watched (skip and the police) and therefore doubly naive; skip, the overconfident petty thief, is singularly unaware, trailed by federal agents; the feds, all knowing, are ultimately helpless. they can't stop the ""passing"" of government secrets or the spread of communism.",1

"updated january 1st, 2006  parsifal is one of my two favorite wagner operas or music dramas, to be more accurate, (meistersinger is the other.) though it's hard to imagine it as the ""top of anyone's pops"". the libretto, by the composer as usual, is a muddle of religion, paganism, eroticism, and possibly even homo-eroticism, and its length may make it seem to the audience like hearing paint dry.  wagner, being a famous anti-semite, (klingsor may be one of his surrogate jewish villains.) naturally entrusted the premiere to an unconverted (not for want of rw's trying!) hermann levi, who was his favorite conductor! (go figure!) kundry, a most mixed-up-gal and another likely jewish surrogate, is both villainous or benevolent, depending on the scene.  considering that many video versions of parsifal seem on the stodgy side, this film of the opera is, in comparison, a breath of fresh air. hans-jürgen syberberg, the director, has brought considerable imagination to it but it's hard to know why he made some of his choices. for example: the notorious dual parsifals (of each gender!), the puppets, the death-mask-of-wagner set and various dolls and symbols such as the nazi swastika in one of the traveling scenes. (if i remember, the ""real"" engelbert humperdinck wrote the actual music to pad out the scene changes.) though wagner himself died much too early to be an actual nazi, many of his descendants (as well as his second wife cosima.) were at least fellow-travelers, including their grandson wolfgang wagner who still runs the bayreuth festival at an advanced age. in fact, wolfgang's son gottfried wagner, in complete opposition to his father, has tried to come to terms honestly with his great-grandfather.  syberberg, too, seems politically ambiguous from what i've read. in 1977, he made a well-known film on hitler, ""hitler: ein film aus deutschland"" (sometimes called ""our hitler"" in english.). since it lasts all of 8 hours and hasn't been widely distributed, most people have not seen it (including myself.).  armin jordan, the conductor of the audio cd on which this film is based, plays amfortas (sung by wolfgang schöne) edith clever (yvonne minton) plays kundry, michael kutter and karin krick play the dual parsifals (both sung by reiner goldberg.!) and robert lloyd and aage haugland both play and sing gurnemanz and klingsor.  though the opera takes place over a long period of time and all (except kundry?) have been described as having aged considerably between acts 2 and 3, no one looks a day older by the end of the opera. (the magic of the grail? in this opera the grail is the cup from which jesus drank at the last supper and not mary magdalene as in more recent times, an idea i find preposterous!).  the conducting and singing are all quite serviceable and the dvd seems to have improved the sound, if not the picture, to a great extent. (yes, i agree that ""kna's"" approach is superior, even on the second, stereo, version but he is probably superior to all recorded versions on the whole.)  not a parsifal for all wagnerites but i think it works quite well as a filmed opera.",1
"a man wakes from a nightmare about bats. he and his wife go out into the desert for a picnic on their honeymoon. he seems to hear a strange noise, and she is disturbed by the sight of a bat crawling across their picnic blanket. he wants to go on a tour of a cave, which has something to do with some kind of work he is doing, but she wants to enjoy their honeymoon. she relents. they go on the tour, but leave the group to make out. she falls down a slope, where she is disturbed by insects. he follows her. he hears the strange noise again, and seems to know a bat is approaching; one does, and gets in her hair. he fights it off her, and it attacks him, biting his forehead.  they get out of the cave, but when they are in a gondola at a ski resort, he starts having seizures in which he has hallucinations or visions of bats attacking people. he becomes angry when this happens. he's unable to drink alcohol without spitting it out. his wife worries about rabies, and he starts a pasteur treatment for that, but reacts violently to the injection.  and then some people are killed. we see parts of the man's transformation into a bat person. it seems it is not just in his mind. whether the bat bite causes these transformations is not clear, since he already was having some symptoms prior to the bite.  while the title seems inappropriate, the implication at the end is that the same thing is happening to another person. not a very good movie, but i liked the variety of the desert, cave, and ski-slope locations, and some of the weirder scenes. i didn't think this was as bad as other people do, and i didn't think the 1999 movie bats was as bad as others think either (i rated that one a 5/10).",0
"this movie starts out with an execution of a practitioner of witchcraft and his mistress. his head is chopped off and buried separately of his body...sounds like ""the thing that wouldn't die"" doesn't it? well it does play out a little like that, but once the body is reunited with the head, all the interesting and gruesome deaths are done and the movie moves very slowly. i mean the movie is only 88 minutes long and i kept thinking ""when is it going to end""? the characters in the movie are idiots for the most part and they pretty much deserve to die for being really stupid. the villain is also very bad as he is slow moving and really you wonder how he manages to do anything considering he is afraid of jewelery. the only thing to keep you watching after the head is reattached is the fact that there are so many boobs being flashed that you really begin to lose track. still i want to see a horror movie, not a soft core porn flick and as a horror movie it is way to slow moving with way to many slow stretches to be even somewhat enjoyable. and don't read the back of the box as it made it out like there were flesh eating zombies attacking the town, there isn't...only a small scene where three or four zombies attack a house and are so easily repelled they are not a factor in the movie at all and their scene is rather pointless. so for the most part i say you should avoid this movie unless you come across it for really cheap.",0
"well, it turned out as i expected: visual overload but nothing else added to the original. what did surprise me however was that the storyline was fairly drastically changed compared to the 1968 flick. initially this awoke my interest, but what eventually surprised was that the new twists and turns (a) were apparently invented in order to present us with a typical hollywood-like product and (b) made the whole storyline improbable! the 1968 story was breathtakingly straightforward, and included no time-storms or any bogus of that sort: it just stated that when you come home after a long journey, things might have changed a bit. earth might have fallen in the hands of apes, for example. like many 'old' movies, it's main ingredient was suspense (hell, does anyone understand that word these days?). in this burton movie, an attempt has been made to turn the whole thing into an action movie, but at what cost? surely, the images are overwhelming, and a lot of time and money has been put into the design of a complete ape-culture (even ape-music!), but what's wrong?  first, the suspension of disbelief is made very hard, because the apes have a lot of hollywood-human traits. i refer especially to ari and the slave-trader. these traits include emotional skills like irony, sarcasm, and an overtly displayed array of 'subtle' emotions. it makes you forget that the apes are apes, which is essential.  second, the humans talk. of course, we can imagine that humans will never forget how to speak, but the fact that the apes had speech and the humans didn't made the ape/human role-switching very tangible and stressing in the 1968 version. the wound in the throat that charlton heston gets there is essential to his survival and his later regained speech essential to his uniqueness and the interest that dr. zira has in him (so, no need for things like human rights activists or ape-human love in order to explain things).  third, the fact that they talk ads a great deal to the implausibility, but is a necessary twist in the new movie, since capt. davidson has to play the hollywood-let's-save-the-whole-world- and-have-a-good-ending-for-everyone- and-still-make-it-to-the-lounge-bar- for-a-cool-diet-coke character. oh my god, will they never learn? i new it from the start, when there was only one guy who got lost! they were in need of a hero! and then the script writers go on reasoning: we need one guy... so, why would one guy get lost... because he tries to save an ape from an electromagnetic storm... implausible! but it's necessary because it shows the audience that he respects apes! since, in these modern and politically correct times, we can't have a xenophobic ape-hater like charlton heston's 68 character loose on the screen: let's give them a bubblegum version!  fourth, okay, the general twist of the original 'discovering the truth' of the 1968 film to the modern version (he finds that his own mother ship crashed on the planet ages ago and that their lab-apes developed their society, where heston simply discovered that just, somehow, the apes overtook the earth while he was away) is nicely done. the second, battle-part comes as an anti-climax. that's because this movie has added the first two planet of the apes movies in one plot. nice try, but the chill you feel when davidson and you discover that he's lost on the planet forever just washes out due to the uninteresting battle-part.  fifth: the ending!!! for chrissakes, who came up with that?! (a) davidson crashes twice with his escape pod, which seems an unsteerable object, while the chimp manages to simply land gracefully? come on, who'd believe that? if the pods are really small space crafts (davidson simply flies off into space at the end) and not merely escape vessels, he might have managed a safe landing at least once, no? and what about that ending???? i mean, in the original film it was clear that everything took place on earth. but here: the whole movie takes place on a distant planet, and suddenly the same (there's a thade statue) ape culture is on earth??? how come? did the apes of the far planet evolve technologically, flew into the time storm and colonised earth before davidson's mission took off? why is thade worshiped? stupid stupid stupid.  helena bonham carter is even adorable and beautiful as an ape, but i'd expected no less. i preferred her ape above estella warren as a human, but maybe i got some loose wire in my head. nevertheless, the only convincing apes were tim roth as thade (wonderful!) and ari's household ape (the ex-general, but i forgot his name).  nonono, a lot of things could and should have been added/altered to the 1968 pic, but not the plot, at least not in that way. it was simple and clear and needed no additional explaining. it was nicely tongue-in cheek and caricatured. don't stylize everything...",0
"""moonstruck"" is a lovely little film directed by superb story teller, norman jewison (in the heat of the night, fiddler on the roof, the hurricane). the film is great on many levels. it shows a good slice of italian culture, has a touching romance, and (best of all) is a hilarious comedy.  one thing i liked most about the film was the relative unconventional looks of the actors. nicolas cage looks positively odd for most of the film, and cher... well, cher always looks a little odd.  overall, it's a fun film, and easy to recommend.  7.4 out of 10",1
"an actor's first film is usually something one can afford to miss - it's often that first job where the lack of film experience by everyone involved is truly on display, and this film is no exception.  but worse than that, even by 1982 standards this is so bad, it's hysterically funny. filmed entirely in the chicago area on an obviously small budget, most of the acting by the entire cast is stiff, wooden, and cartoonish - a cross between a high school play and bad community theater. noise from nearby traffic often drowns out the dialog, and the dialog is truly bad, very declarative in a way that comes off as forced and expedient rather than natural and organic. scenes are contrived and choppy, and even though the characters go through a span of years, neither the children nor the adults age at all.  i do believe it's possible to make a christian film that's palatable to a large, secular audience, but too often the creators of such films are so focused on 'the message' or in this case, their own autobiographical ties to the project that good film production values are tossed aside. (i'm sure it's no coincidence that the main character has the same name as the producer/director/editor - and cast member.)   luckily, michael madsen was much more interesting - and believable - to watch in his subsequent films. careers like his are certainly not built on films like this one.",0
"i looked over the other comments and was thoroughly amused to find that clearly only people who actually worked on the movie had commented. i mean, i hate to say bad things about an amateur production, but if you make a bad movie and want to comment on it, tone it down a little. ""groundbreaking"" is a little over the top. this is a boston based college production that doesn't even achieve the level of most amateur college film. it's what you would expect a bunch of kids to do. a silly action film without much creativity. it's pretty funny if you're willing to poke fun at it. not something you will ever see unless you are a student at emerson college.",0
"beautiful story of wisconsin native, dan jansen, and his real life, agonizing struggle to win the 1994 olympic gold medal in speed skating, despite his overwhelming emotional loss with the death of his much loved best friend and family member; his sister, jane.  this story's main focus is to sensitively portray the real life emotional turmoil of grief, that one feels in loosing a special loved one, and the struggle to productively cope and rise above the great loss! it is the incredible story of dan jansen's heartbreak in loosing his beloved sister to leukemia, his struggle to cope with the intensity of his grief, while still maintaining his dream to win at the olympics, and his ultimate triumph in winning the gold medal in speed skating for america, and in honor of his sister's memory; thereby fulfilling his childhood promise to jane!  after dan jansen's remarkable gold medal performance in the winter olympic in lillihamer, norway, he established a foundation in 1994 to help fight leukemia, which claimed the life of his sister, and to support youth sports programs, educational and scholarship awards. his dan jansen foundation promotes the philosophy that: ""as his father always told him at a young age: 'there is more to life than skating around in circles!' maintaining a proper perspective is key! so, too, is setting goals, and realizing one's dreams through perseverence, overcoming adversity and never giving up!""  recommended for anyone who has ever suffered the great loss of someone very special, and dearly loved within your life! and, for anyone who still believes in the achievement of dreams, and never giving up!",1
i don't know who could find fault with a simply human and funny film like this with lots of delights for your heart. i enjoyed each minute of it and guessed the ending half way through the movie -- but that did not disappoint me at all. it will not only touch your heart but it's such a good family friendly film--we need many more like these!,1
"drew barrymore plays young holly gooding, who moves in with aspiring hack screenwriter patrick highsmith (george newbern) and completely disrupts his life by claiming that her ""doppelganger"", or evil twin, is out to kill her and her family.  this silly horror film is kind of hard to take seriously, even if the film-makers and actors themselves seem to be dead serious. ""doppelganger"" is muddled, with some unpleasantly dumb dialog.  some viewers will note that drew's character's name is drawn from audrey hepburn's role in ""breakfast at tiffany's"", and that newbern's character's name is a play on the name of famed author patricia highsmith (he is actually trying to re-write ""breakfast"" as a horror film, believe it or not!).  i suppose that it deserves some credit for not being quite your typical horror film - i mean, writer/director avi nesher seems to genuinely care for his characters, and gives his film more plot than standard slasher fare.  after a silly villain-explains-everything-to-the-audience confrontation, the film goes on to submit a hideous, out-there climax that has to be seen to be believed. this film certainly does not skimp on the gore.  but hey! drew kills her mother in this one. no, i'm not joking. jaid barrymore shows up near the beginning only to get violently slaughtered.  drew is always very watchable, and very sexy in this one. newbern comes off as a likable-enough, ""nice"" sort of guy. but the highpoint of the film has to be the scene with sally kellerman, an attractive veteran who's very professional in her one scene as a former nun who's started a phone sex business(!!!!!!).  the film is basically junk but fairly amusing on a sleazy, sordid little level.  4/10",0
"all i can say is, if you don't fall in love with big and little edie after watching this movie, then you're not human! even after watching it for the first time, i was hooked. it is a mesmerizing experience that is difficult to describe, as i'm sure other fans will attest to. after watching it, you will cry to think that these two wonderful ladies are no longer with us. at least we have grey gardens to remember them! i think we all long to possess the fierce independence these two ladies were graced with. although i have always admired jackie onassis kennedy, she does not stay in your heart the way big and little edie do. what a rare treat to have know such people; i only wish i had!",1

"the ruth snyder - judd gray murder in 1927 inspired ogden nash to write a broadway play called machinal. more famously, it inspired james m. cain to write two short novels which anyone who has actually reached the point where they are reading this review would be familiar with - double indemnity and the postman always rings twice. both became film noir classics of the 1940's, double indemnity being arguably the most perfect noir ever made. some of the real-life elements of the snyder-gray story were captured by cain - the old age and indifference of albert gray, ruth's high sex drive, ruth and judd's passionate affair and complicity in the murder and that famous double indemnity insurance clause. missing elements included the fact that the actual setting was a very urban manhattan - albert snyder being a respected newspaper editor. the numerous incompetent and failed attempts were also ignored in order to cut to the chase.  cain's double indemnity was filmed perfectly by billy wilder - let's ignore stanwyck's ridiculous wig as one of those interesting accidents of film lore! the postman always rings twice, however, was filmed thrice and ossessione, an italian version and luchino visconti's first film, was the first of three versions. before commenting on it, i'll recommend the lana turner - john garfield version of 1946 in its entirety and five minutes of the 1981 jack nicholson - jessica lange version for the great sex scene on the dining table.  ossessione is not as noirish as the postman always rings twice. it has a strong neo-realist look which makes it a great movie, but a lot of the essential noir elements are missing. it does not have low-key lighting and unconventional camera angles. the dialog is not hard-boiled and instead the film concentrates more on characterization. this is the longest version of the story and goes deeply into characterization. its also a lot more sexual than the lana turner version. we have a very obvious adulterous relationship and giovanna is very obviously a nymphomaniac. a new character is introduced into the story - la spagnola - with very obvious homosexual overtones. there is also a small, but very well-played role for a dancer who moonlights as a prostitute.  this is a far greater study of the working class than of crime. the audience really gets the feeling of poverty and grime. the drifter is a complete tramp, the wife is no lana turner and may even have been a prostitute before marriage. her husband is an obscene capitalist - obese, rude and arrogant. i think the casting was brilliant for this film. my only beef is with the overlong running time. everything is drawn out too long and it would have been more effective if it had been more economical. nevertheless, fans of noir and realism will definitely like ossessione, as i did.",1
"this movie has very good acting by virtually all the cast, a gripping story with a chilling ending, great music, and excellent visuals without significant special effects. it is interesting to note though that, like so much science fiction, its predictions for the future don't appear likely to come to pass as early as depicted. that's not to say we're out of the woods yet, but 2022 is now obviously too soon to be in this condition. it shares this failing with a fairly illustrious list of science fiction classics: ""1984"", ""2001: a space odyssey (compare its space station with our international space station) and isaac asimov's ""i robot"" (positronic brains were to have been invented in the 1990's).",1

"a confused mess from start to finish. like they used to say about the beatles'songs, there was a secret message if you played the lp backward. if one had the patience to watch this films scenes from finish to start, you'd come away with the same degree of disappointment.  apart from all of this psychedelic hodge podge of flashbacks and false starts, the clearest characters were the movie backers, out for revenge if the movie didn't get sorted. there was nothing to like about these two either. overacting, shouting and threats were delivered in comic book fashion. i think one dimensional was an overstatement.  okay, so maybe the artsy types are rolling their eyes reveling in the fact that unlike them, we plebeians just didn't get it. well i'm afraid there was nothing to get. and the two cardinal sins of any bad movie carried from start to finish. a non-existent and pathetic story line if you want to call it that, and by far the worst, not a single character you cared about in the least.",0
"i've really enjoyed this adaptation of ""emma"".i have seen it many times and am always looking forward to seeing it again.though it only lasts 107 minutes, most of the novel plot and sub-plots were developed in a satisfactory way. all the characters are well-portrayed. most of the dialogues come directly from the novel with no silly jokes added as in emma thompson's sense and sensibility.  as a foreigner, i particularly appreciate the perfect diction of the actors. the setting and costumes were beautiful. i find this version quite on a par with the 1995 miniseries ""pride and prejudice"" but then the producer and screenwriter were the same. kate beckinsale did a really good job portraying ""emma"" of whom jane austen said she would create a heroin no-one but her would love. she is snobbish but has just enough youth and inexperience to be still likable. mark strong was also very good at portraying mr knightley, not an easy part, i think, though he has not the charisma shown by colin firth's mr darcy in pride and prejudice. even the end scene (the harvest festival) which does not happen in the novel provides a fitting end except for when it shows emma being cold and almost unpleasant with frank churchill whereas in the novel she was thoroughly reconciled with him, even telling him that she would have enjoyed the duplicity, had she been in his situation. a strange departure from the faithfulness otherwise shown throughout the film. i find the costumes more beautiful and elaborate than in other adaptations from jane austen's novels.",1
"one question that must be asked immediately is: would this film have been made if the women in it were not the aunt and cousin of jacqueline lee bouvier kennedy onassis?  the answer is: probably not.  but, thankfully, they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of jackie.  this documentary by the maysles brothers on the existence (one could hardly call it a life) of edith b. beale, jr., and her daughter edith bouvier beale (edie), has the same appeal of a train wreck -- you don't want to look but you have to.  big edith and little edie live in a once magnificent mansion in east hampton, new york, that is slowly decaying around them. the once beautiful gardens are now a jungle.  magnificent oil painting lean against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vie for space on the walls next to covers of old magazines.  living alone together for many years has broken down many barriers between the two women but erected others.  clothing is seems to be optional. edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with panty hose pulled up over them and bits and pieces of cloth wrapped and pinned around her torso and head.  as edith says ""edie is still beautiful at 56."" and indeed she is. there are times when she is almost luminescent and both women show the beauty that once was there.  there is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension.  their eating habits are (to be polite) strange. ice cream spread on crackers. a dinner party for edith's birthday of wonder bread sandwiches served on fine china with plastic utensils.  time is irrelevant in their world; as edie says ""i don't have any clocks.""  their relationships with men are oh-so-strange.  edie feels like edith thwarted any of her attempts at happiness. she says ""if you can't get a man to propose to you, you might as well be dead."" to which edith replies ""i'll take a dog any day.""  it is obvious that edith doesn't see her role in edie's lack of male companionship. early in the film she states ""france fell but edie didn't.  sometimes it is difficult to hear exactly what is being said. both women talk at the same time and constantly contradict each other.  there is a strange relationship with animals throughout the film; edie feeds the raccoons in the attic with wonder bread and cat food. the cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere.  at one point edie declares ""the hallmark of aristocracy is responsibility."" but they seem to be unable to take responsibility for themselves.  this is a difficult film to watch but well worth the effort.",1
"this is a wonderful movie in a lot of ways. everyone in my family enjoyed it. the animation is excellent and easily demonstrates that there are plenty of producers who create films that are as visually brilliant as anything that comes from the disney studio.  one difference from the normal disney fare is that this dreamworks movie does not feature some wise-cracking side kick for comedy relief. and, there are no sudden moments where the characters break into song. i am sure that a scene at the beginning of the film would not appear in a disney picture: the birth of spirit. but it is done tastefully and is not offensive at all. ""spirit"" was a great breath of fresh air. don't get me wrong. i have loved disney for years and will continue to do so.   ""spirit"" is another example of great animated fare. as soon as it was over, my kids wanted to watch it again. i had the same feeling. i thoroughly recommend it.",1
"remade today, this film would be a very creepy, very disturbing dark comedy. stalking, obsession, and a web of lies and manipulations are given a 1948 gloss of aren't-they-cute harmlessness. drake plays the stalker, an unabashed user of people, alternately pathetic and manipulative, grant plays the stalking victim, alternately angry and oblivious.  vastly disturbing; i haven't been able to look at classic romances with the same suspension of disbelief since.

"sometimes laughter in the middle of a horror film is a signal of its greatness. i remember the nervous laughter from the audience in the re-release of the excorcist really nervous laughter. it punctuated just how freaked out we all were watching the voice of satan coming out of a 12 year old girl. in the case of the 2006 remake of the 1972 cult classic the wicker man however, it made me think that this new wickerman is about as scary as the south park character, scuzzlebut, the friendly forest monster with tv's patrick duffy for a leg and a celery stalk for an arm who's favorite hobby is weaving wicker baskets.  3 years ago a friend of mine in hollywood told me that he heard that nicolas cage was going to do a remake of the film. i started laughing and my friend (keith) got mad at me touting nicolas cage as a great actor. i just didn't think that he could pull it off and unfortunately for moviegoers i was right. gone is the realness, the outstanding original music, the originality, the creepiness and the wonderfully powerful dialogue. instead we have horror movie clichés, affected acting and changes to the storyline that make any believability fall apart. like many of the countless hollywood remakes we have been inundated with lately this feels like we are watching 4th graders on a playground ""playing wickerman"".  the original film takes place on a remote scottish isle where a scottish police officer is lured there to find a missing young girl named rowan morrison. in the new spin a california cop (cage) is lured to an island of the coast of washington state by his ex-girlfriend to find her missing daughter. she sends a photo and the missing daughter looks exactly like a young girl he tried to save in a fiery crash not long ago. the crash still haunts him in part because the girl's body was never found. yet even after he gets a letter with her picture in it that connection is completely cast aside as he heads north, alone, to help his ex-girlfriend find her daughter. he arrives to find an island full of actors pretending to be the descendants of wiccans, many of whom seem like they didn't get call backs for roles in the village. and like the village it isn't long before you realize there is nothing to be afraid of here. not even the cloudy eyed blind sisters who speak in unison.  i think that the opportunity in hollywood to make great amounts of money on a film often comes at great expense to the artistry. i think someone like nicolas cage who is in so many films these days loses touch with the magic that film can be when it gets to the point where he has a personal chef on the set preparing his snacks. we needed a bad re-make of the wickerman like we needed yet another '9-11' movie. i'm starting to wonder if nicolas changed his surname from coppola because he wanted to or because he was pleaded with to do so.",0

"there are some redeeming qualities to this show. one is that the theme tune does have a decent melody. the show does have a nice premise. also, i am probably in the minority, but i like wanda. i like the fact she is caring, and is more a mother figure to timmy. however, despite all this, i do not like this show, it isn't excrement but i do find it very annoying.  i wouldn't say that it is the best animated show on planet earth. when i use that term for an animated tv show, i think of peter pan and the pirates, i think of darkwing duck, i think of scooby doo and i think of talespin. and i hope i am not the only one who really likes the wild thornberrys and resent the fact it gets poked fun at. nor do i think fairly odd parents is the worst animated show on planet earth. i accept it's annoying, and in some ways overrated, but it isn't the worst show on nickolodean. that is chalk zone, god that show is unwatchable. but the worst animated show i've ever seen is shaggy and scooby doo:get a clue, which is crudely animated, unfunny and frankly a disgrace.  one thing i don't like about this show is the animation. the characters, forgive me if i offend, have very weird facial features, and a lot of the backgrounds are dull and lack the colour that make spongebob squarepants and wild thornberrys so nice to look at. the characters with the exception of wanda i find very annoying. i can't believe such a talented voice actress like tara strong(aka. charendoff) voiced timmy. timmy i don't find very likable as a lead character at all, he is annoying and sometimes patronising, and he is a poor decision maker as well. and his voice gets on my nerves. i actually like strong but not in this show. another annoying character is cosmo, the supposedly funny character. instead, his jokes are as unfunny as they could become. they are either a) contrived, or b) over familiar. timmy's parents are awful characters, who don't give a toss about their son, and their personalities wear well thin.  the story lines are very unoriginal on the most part, and i keep thinking, where have i seen this before. the episodes after the arrival of the baby i thought were unwatchable. even worse is the scripts, very unfunny, childish, witless and suffer from a complete lack of energy.  all in all, not the worst show ever, but pretty poor for an animation fan, and fairly uncomfortable to sit through. 3/10- there are redeeming qualities, and i completely understand if people like it. bethany cox",0

"never viewed this film and consider it a great classic with great veteran actors. in the period that this film was made, people in america were different, there was no tv or all the modern things we have today, except the radio and the starting out of great films being made in hollywood. sweet innocent tales of young romance between a young girl or guy was viewed differently than it is today. ann shirley,""murder my sweet"",'44 played a young orphan gal who was called carrot top because of her red hair and found herself being taken into a home of two elderly folks, who were like two wise owls and watched over ann shirley. it was a small town and everyone knew everyone and if anything happened, the entire town found out about it within minutes. it is a down to earth film with nice decent people trying to help each other in a very very simple way of living. today, it seems very corn ball and stupid, but believe me, this was the way people were in america during the 1920'. & 30's and they were a great generation that loved good family films.",1
"this motion picture has a steady, haunting pace backed up with great acting (one of chamberlain's best performances) and a story that is revealed to us over time.  beyond that, the music fully establishes the mood and assists in maintaining an uneasy, cautious and somber tone.  weir's story is enhanced by using aboriginals, their stories and their tensions with the dominant white population to deliver a fantasy tale that is ominous.  although they are unrelated in story as well as genre, this maintained the same feeling within me as ursula le guin's ""lathe of heaven"" (1980).   ""the last wave"" is a dramatic thriller with some shocking moments. remember, ""hacking and slicing"" doesn't make a film a horror movie, it's the psychological element of fear and trepidation that rests within us all.",1
"either or, i love the suspension of any formulaic plot in this movie. i have re-visited it many times and it always holds up. a little too stylized for some but i fancy that any opera lover will love it. norman jewison, a fellow canadian, takes enormous chances with his movies and his casting and it nearly always pays off in movies that are off centre and somehow delicious, as this one is. i have often wondered at the paucity of cher's acting roles, whether she has chosen to minimize this part of her life or she does not get enough good roles to chew on. i have found her to be a superb actress who can retreat into a role, as in this particular one or be loud and daring and fierce as in ""mask"". i found the comedic strokes broad at times ( a hair salon called ""cinderella"")but this was the whole intent of both the writer and director. nicolas page plays the angst ridden tenor of opera, all extravagant gestures, at one point demanding a knife so as to slit his own throat. the brooklyn scenes are magical, this is a brooklyn under moonlight, romanticized and dramatic, just like opera. all in all a very satisfying film not to everyone's taste by a long shot, i loved the ending, everyone brought together like a greek chorus, every part subtly nuanced and blending with the others, the camera pulling away down the hall, leaving the players talking. 8 out of 10.",1
"the film looks super on paper. a romantic comedy in which a frantic lover gets dragged into a smuggling thriller should be generic cross-breeding gold, especially with this excellent romcomic cast.  i'm afraid lawrence kasdan simply gives his two stars too much rope though and they duly go and hang themselves. adam brooks' script may well be to blame but you'd expect better from the kevin kline of a fish called wanda. instead the two ping-pong off one another and the unlikely burgeoning romance is never reconciled satisfactorily with the reason either of them are in and dashing around france.  jean reno co-stars amiably as the cop-with-a-heart and i guess wishes he was a star-with-a-part. mind you he went on to do those pink panther remake(s!) so perhaps he was ok with this... 3/10",0

"  how this film ever got a 6 star average is beyond me. the script is so banal, and frankly an insult to whomevers life it is based upon. the cinematography comes straight from the slick world of advertising, and the talented ridley scott should be ashamed. demi moore however, shows none a surprise by participating in this film, if one looks at her tracklist. all in all, a ""high concept"" style film that even don simpson would be ashamed of.",0
"this was a personal favorite of mine when i was young, it had everything that was great with 90's kids movies... lovable dinosaurs, cute kids, an eccentric villain, and a few great songs (and not the typical little mermaid/beauty and the beast type songs, but ones that are atually entertaining)! i ran into this movie again recently and i still love it as much as ever! i recommend that everyone of every age should see this movie, and i definitely think that it should be introduced to the younger generations! sorry not the most informative, i'm in kinda a rush... just please, trust me. all who go against this movie are killing their inner child!",1
"alain chabat is a fine actor, writer and director but maybe a trifle misguided to take an 'idea' credit for a story that probably had them rolling in the aisles when aristophanes was still learning that it's 'i' before 'e' except after 'c'. but, like i said, chabat is a fine actor and he can do charm when he needs to. i'm also gradually overcoming an aversion to charlotte gainsbourg who also turns in an accomplished performance. if you absolutely insist on knowing, the 'plot' is the one about the guy well into his forties and more than content to be single. this doesn't sit well with his mother and five sisters and to get them off his back he makes an 'arrangement' with the sister of a colleague to pose - for fifteen thousand euros -as his new girlfriend, allow the romance to come to fruition with a wedding and then jilt him, thus getting him off the hook. naturally they wind up together but along the way there's some sub-benedek and beatrice duelling and all things considered it's a pretty painless ninety minutes and performing so well at the french box office that a sequel may not be out of the question.",1
"i love sharks. and mutants. and explosions. theoretically, with those parameters in mind, hammerhead: shark frenzy should have been the best movie ever.  it is not.  the monster looks like a villain from power rangers, and has approximately the same range of rubbery movement. this might be okay if the makers weren't quite as proud of its design as they seem to be. that is to say, for a guy in a big rubber suit in an action/scifi/horror flick that could benefit from some mystery, the shark gets a lot of screen time. granted, it is usually shaky and erratic. i guess you're supposed to assume that it's so scary that even the camera guy freaks out.  the camera goes to a person about to get eaten, the camera goes to the shark. the camera goes back to the person about to get eaten, only now they are screaming and armless. and so on.  the costuming is bad, the acting is poor, and the special effects are sub-par, but the writing is by far the worst. things happen completely randomly so that more people can be eaten, or so something can explode. because let me tell you, the people who made this movie definitely went in with a more explosions = more better mindset. characters shoot cars and there is a massive explosion. they shoot helicopters, there is a massive explosion. barrels, rocks, trees, whatever, they all explode, so much so that the freaking shark even explodes at the end.  speaking of which, i don't care how crazy a person is, i find it hard to believe that anyone would think trying to make a giant half-person half-shark have sex with a woman in order to make freaky shark people babies is a good idea. that is, unless that person is the mad scientist in this movie.  the bad thing is, the movie is so random (and at times, boring) that even its badness is not really enough to hold a person's prolonged interest. it might be a good one to mst3k with your friends, but past that, if you happen to catch this bad boy on, do yourself a favor and change the channel.",0
"night of the living homeless is a funny spoof of the 1978 film(and the 2004 remake) of ""dawn of the dead"".only this time...with the homeless.the episode has homeless people all coming to south park and the people cannot figure out why.they treat the homeless like zombies who want change and a few of the parents end up on the roof of a supermarket like in the movie.so now it's up to the boys to find out where they came from and how to get rid of them.this is a fairly funny episode with some good moments like the boys singing their own version of the 2pac/dr.dre song ""california love"".overall a good episode.  8/10",1
"every movie from the thirties is dated, but if you were to watch only john ford movies it would seem more dated than if you watched others. i.e. grand hotel is comparatively modern melodrama. with ford, there's always the hard-sell of someone's nobility (abe, the joads). always the over-emphasis of some heavy's badness. always the poorly crafted, awkward and obvious scripts. this is no exception. it's just a rather belabored device to deliver sentiment. and sentiment is all this has going for it.  what ford does here doesn't make me appreciative of lincoln, it just makes me wonder how the states were ever settled by the population of complete morons depicted here. ford went on to make decent movies. this is too dated to be anything but bad. it feels entirely false.   henry fonda with a fake nose is bizarre. and no one from illinois would pronounce the trailing 's,' or say ""shonuff!""",0
"since crouching tiger hidden dragon came along, there's been a lot of talk about a revival of the hong kong movie industry. don't believe it. the people now making movies in hk give new meaning to the word crass. running out of time 2 is a perfect example. ekin cheng is the name draw, here, but he spends most of the film just grinning idiotically and flipping a coin. he flips the coin over and over and again and again. why? who knows? sean lau plays a cop who chases after the coin-flipping pretty boy. but once again: who knows why? there's a pretty actress in the female lead who runs some sort of company and she has to pay a ransom or something but she mostly just looks like she would rather be at a spa or shopping centre than in front of a camera. nothing makes any sense. there is no action. there is no sex. there is no comedy. all there is is a name: ekin cheng. and you know what? who cares?",0
"this review contains spoilers for those who are not aware of the details of the true story on which this movie is based.  the right to be presumed ""innocent until proven guilty"" is a basic entitlement of anyone in a civilised society; but according to fred schepisi's partisan but sadly convincing story of a famous australian murder trial, it was not granted to lindy chamberlain, accused of killing her baby. the story suggesting her innocence was unlikely (a dingo was alleged to have taken it), but those implying her guilt even more so, and there was no solid evidence against her. but the australian public was transfixed by the possibility of her guilt, and the deeply religious chamberlains appeared creepy when appearing in the media (and the media themselves, of course, were anything but innocent in this process). so although cleared by an initial inquest, they were later prosecuted and convicted. although chamberlain was eventually released, this shamefully only followed the discovery of new evidence ""proving"" their innocence, something no defendants should have to produce.  'a cry in the dark' is well acted throughout, especially by meryl streep, who puts on a convincing australian accent (at least to this pom's ears) and manages keep lindy sympathetic (to us) while still conveying how she managed to become a national hate figure. the scenes where she actually gets imprisoned are simple but heartbreaking, because we believe in the characters as real.   regardless of the accuracy of its portrayal of this story (something i can't comment on), the wider theme of this film will ring horribly true to anyone with a passing knowledge of the british popular press and its ruthless habit of appealing directly to their readership's least charitable instincts. no legal system will ever be perfect; but the current cry against asylum seekers in contemporary british tabloids comes from exactly the same pit of evil as the voices that put lindy chamberlain away. i'm not a religious man, but the bible still contains some killer lines (if you'll excuse the pun). ""judge not lest ye be judged"" is one of them.",1
"before i start, i _love_ eddie izzard. i think he's one of the funniest stand-ups around today. possibly that means i'm going into this with too high expectations, but i just didn't find eddie funny in this outing.  i think the main problem is eddie is trying too hard to be eddie. everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic, and we all love him for it. but in circle, he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny, and completely lost me in places. many of the topics he covers he has covered before - i even think i recognised a few recycled jokes in there.  if you buy the dvd you'll find a behind-the-scenes look at eddie's tour (interesting in places, but not very funny), and a french language version of one of his shows. die-hards will enjoy seeing eddie in a different language, but subtitled comedy isn't very funny.  if you're a fan of eddie you've either got this already or you're going to buy it whatever i say. if you're just passing through, buy glorious or dressed to kill - you won't be disappointed. with circle, you probably will.",0
"it's difficult to precisely put into words the sheer awfulness of this film. an entirely new vocabulary will have to be invented to describe the complete absence of anything even remotely recognizable as 'humor' or even 'entertainment' in ""rabbit test."" so, as a small contribution to this future effort, i'd like to suggest this word:   ""hubiriffic"" (adj.) a combination of 'hubristic' and 'terrific'; used to describe overly ambitious debacles like the film ""rabbit test.""  joan rivers and ""hollywood squares"" producer jay redack have severely over-reached their meager abilities to amuse in this 82-minute festival of wretchedness. trying to put together an airplane! style comedy with a moldy collection of gags, (note to joan: german doctors haven't been funny since vaudeville) disinterred from their graves in the catskills - that's is bad enough. but compounding this cinematic crime is river's directorial style, which can best be described as 'ugly', and a cast of once-and-future has-beens so eager to please they overplay even the weakest of throwaway gags.  adrift in this sargasso sea of sap is a hapless billy crystal in his film debut role as the film's hapless protagonist lionel. watching crystal in this pic is much like watching a blind person take a stroll in a minefield; eventually the cringe reflex becomes a semi-permanent condition as cheap joke after cheap joke blows up in his face.  i can only speculate about the sort of audience who might actually like rabbit test. cabbages, mollusks and mildly retarded lizards are all likely candidates. but for self-aware, thinking humans - i'd enthusiastically recommend pouring bleach in your eyes before i'd recommend ""rabbit test.""",0
"i can't believe i actually sat through the whole thing. this movie has the worst acting since killjoy.  here is a brief outline of the plot: the movie starts out with jojo and that other chick sitting around on the beach, drooling over a skinny blonde-haired beach ""hunk"" who looks like he hasn't been to the gym a day in his life. somehow, everyone knows him, and every single chick in the movie wants him. uh oh! here comes the competition! the stereotypical ""hot chick"" and her best friends, who drive an ugly pink car. we soon find out jojo's mom got the job of a lifetime in australia, which means that jojo would have to move and leave her best friend behind (oh no, i think i'm gonna cry). a huge storm comes, and fills their swimming pool with nasty water. somehow, for no apparent reason, the little chick falls into the pool, and comes face to face with, yup, you guessed it, a mermaid! this is where the ""story"" really takes off. basically, they want to get the mermaid to fall in love with the ""hunk"".  this is a preteen flick with acting so bad, it makes the 80's look like the pinnacle of oscar-worthy performances. this movie has all the clichés possible... the best friends, the ""hunk"" who everyone wants, the ""hot"" bad girl and her bitchy friends, the scary old man... you name it, it's in there. i took one for a lot of people by watching this. consider my hour and 40 minutes a sacrifice to you. please, don't see this movie. don't make it so i suffered in vain.",0
"if an auteur gives himself 2 credits before the main title and about 15 more credits before the movie starts, and the first shot shows the auteur rolling around on a bed in lycra bike shorts, it won't be a surprise to observe that said auteur has the kind of body that should never be seen in spandex. the kind of look that might be useful to a homosexual aversion therapist.  others have given this thing the dishing it deserves. for me the most pitiable moment came when the trip from la was signified by a plane landing at what appeared to be lax; and the return was signified by a shot of a fedex cargo plane.",0
"given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president, this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance. for entertainment value i found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant. i was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time, but also found the music and dancing incredible. also it is quite cool to see sammy davis jr as such a very young child actor. he plays rufus jones, a young boy who is being consoled by his mammy. he is told 'why some day you could be president'. this was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing, charming and funny. the bulk of the movie is a fantasy sequence of what the government would be like if it was run by a black man. they depict the seats of government as being like a revivalist baptist church.  the fact was when i stumbled onto this movie one day it drew me in. it is really well done and very entertaining. i believe if we can look beyond the racism we can see this movie for all it brings us. in fact to realize that it is not only not ridiculous to have a black president, but that it is normal, just makes this movie that much more relevant. it clearly marks a moment in time for our collective consciousness.",1
for a comedy this has a decent and inventive plot and trey parker and matt stone's comic timing is perfect. there are dozens of funny moments to this fantastic movie. i especially like the multitude of colors and the way the clash in the sports arena scenes. robert stacks unsolved mysteries spoof is also very amusing.,1
"a small town is attacked by a horde of bloodthirsty vampires. the only hope is a lone avenger and a group of ragtag survivors.  released in 1993, ""darkness"" garnered something of a cult following upon release. it's easy to see why-it's loaded (and i mean freaking loaded) with gore, and it's energy and enthusiasm, like that found in other no-budget cult horror flicks like ""the dead next door"" and ""the children of ravensback"", is actually rather infectious.  while that may be true, that's sadly not enough to save it. the film was shot on a super 8, so the image is grainy and dark, making things very difficult to see (it would have been great if it had obscured the protagonists dreadful mullet.) also grating is the soundtrack, made up of annoying casio keyboard and even more annoying death metal (seriously, what is it with these no budget horror flicks and bad death metal?) while one isn't expecting oscar worthy performances, the acting is still strictly amateur hour, as the actors sometimes seem almost confused instead of frightened or threatened.  in the end, i'm sure fans of no-budget gorefests will love this. everyone else though, will wish there was a little more meat on the ribs.",0

"at first, three words: read the book! really guys - this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters. i loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film. it was ludicrous, with half a heart and the story bad explained. the novel - in the first place! - wasn't meant to focus on an adventure! that's only the surroundings. in the film, the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat! additional, the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious! they screwed it up! ... i'll never watch it again!",0
"...that the bette davis version of this film was better than the kim novak version.  despite all of the other comments written here, i really prefer the bette davis version, even though the novak version has a more coherent story line.  however: davis' mildred's raw emotions seem to me to be more apt to a sluttish girl who seems easily to become a prostitute.  and it is those raw emotions that constitute *part* of what the poor doctor falls in love with. he has emotions of despair, of failure, of ""otherness"" - strong emotions that he represses. davis' mildred, on the other hand, displays her emotions immediately and without censure. she has no feelings of despair, or of failure, or of ""otherness""; rather, she is merely surviving as a poor cockney woman in the victorian era.  novak's portrayal was a more vulnerable mildred than was davis', almost through the the whole movie. davis' mildred was **never** vulnerable until she actually had to go to the doctor and beg for assistance. and when he reviles her - for her method of keeping body and soul together, and for continually taking advantage of his love for her - she unleashes arguably the most passionate repudiation of snobbish holier than thou attitude ever seen on screen: ""i wiped my mouth! i wiped my mouth!!"" novak's vulnerability was excellent. davis' realism was monumental.  imdb votes concur!",1
"remember these two stories fondly and in the first, set in the not too distant future, we see a young boy preparing for examination day, the state i.q test. the boy is slightly puzzled as to his parents anxiety as some of his friends have already done it already and eventually goes off to do the test. upon arriving he is given an injection and is curious as to why. the examiner smiles and tells him that it is just to make sure he tells the truth. the boy then asks, puzzled again, why wouldn't he? it is later and the parents are sitting waiting worriedly by the screen when a message appears and declares that the state are sorry, but their son's i.q level has exceeded the national quotient and ask politely would they like a private burial. a corker of a concluding scene! a message from charity was a heart warming story about a fluke mental connection between a girl from the past and a guy from the present. which pans out into a weird story of witchcraft accusations in the past and delving into the history pages in the present. a nice story with a heartwarming conclusion.",1
"i recommend watching this film with your significant other if you're planning a romantic evening with him/her. the chemistry between johnny weissmuller and maureen o'sullivan as tarzan and jane is so steamy it could fog up your screen.  after the original film, we begin to see how tarzan and jane have adapted to the jungle and to each other. jane's skimpy jungle wear and tarzan's protest when jane covers up for their visitors illuminates that they are not just romantically, but also quite sexually in love.  one's imagination can supplement the constant touching and love talk between tarzan & jane to portray how much jane is actually teaching tarzan about love emotionally, romantically and sexually. and jane's student is not only embracing but also thriving with his previously untapped sexuality.  the skin show in this film is off the charts. in addition to jane's two-piece sexy midriff, leg, and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with tarzan. (although it is not o'sullivan, but olympic swimmer josephine mckim who doubles for her in this scene) weissmuller, also reveals a tremendous body and perfect pectorals in his barely there loincloth. the ladies will delight when weissmuller emerges from the water after his lengthy fight with the giant crocodile and sounds his yell - with his water soaked loincloth practically falling off his hips.  it's a shame that the over-protective censors toned down the adult nature of the tarzan films after this entry. although the weissmuller tarzan films would still prosper in the years to come, they would rarely approach the sex appeal of this movie.",1
"well well well. as good as john carpenter's season 1 outing in ""masters of horror"" was, this is the complete opposite. he certainly proved he was still a master of horror with ""cigarette burns"" but ""pro-life"" is perhaps the worst i have seen from him.  it's stupid, totally devoid of creepy atmosphere and tension and it overstays it's welcome, despite the less-than-an-hour running time. the script is nonsense, the characters are irritable and un-appealing and the conclusion is beyond absurd.  and for those suckers who actually bought the dvd (one of them being me); did you see how carpenter describes the film? he's actually proud of it and he talks about it as his best work for a long time, and he praises the script. and in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious screw up that made it to the final cut, he just says he didn't feel it essential to rectify the mistake and he just let it be there. i fear the old master has completely lost his touch. i sincerely hope i'm proved wrong.  i want to leave on a positive note and mention that the creature effects are awesome, though. technically speaking, this film is top notch, with effective lighting schemes and make up effects.",0
"no one would argue that this 1945 war film was a masterpiece. (how could any 1945 war film be a masterpiece?) and yet this is an extremely effective telling of a true story, that of al schmidt, blinded on guadalcanal, as played by john garfield, who spent days wearing a blindfold to capture the nuances of a blind person's actions. robert leckie, in ""helmet for my pillow"",denigrates schmidt's popularity in favor of his foxhole mate, who was killed, writing that ""the country must have needed live heroes.""   well, i suppose the country did. and they had one here. there is a single combat scene in the movie, bound to the studio lot, lasting only ten minutes or so, and occurring less than halfway through the film instead of being saved for the climax, but it is the scariest and most realistic depiction of men under fire that i can remember having seen on screen, including those in ""saving private ryan"". men yell with fear, scream at each other and at the enemy, and bleed and die, without the aid of color, stereophonic sound, squibs, or gore.  simply from a technological point of view, the film is outstanding. it isn't just that we learn how complicated a mechanism a .30 caliber, water-cooled browning machine gun is, or that it must be fired in bursts of only a few rounds, or that it isn't waved around like a fire hose, as in so many other war movies. the technical precision adds to the scene's riveting quality. the need to stick to short bursts is horrifying when dozens of shrieking enemies are pouring across a creek fifty feet away with the sole aim of exterminating you and your two isolated comrades confined to a small gun emplacement.   the performances are solid, if not bravura, including those of the ubiquitous 1940s support, john ridgeley, and a radiant, youthful eleanor parker. the framing love story is spare, but it works, and ultimately is quite moving. a striking dream sequence is included. it's not bunuel, but for a routine 1945 film, it stands out as original and effective.   albert maltz may have overwritten the script, or it may have been altered by someone else. it could have used the kind of pruning that might have introduced some much needed ambiguity. still, there are odd verbal punctuations that have a surprising impact on the viewer -- ""why don't god strike me dead?"" and, ""in the eyes, lee. get 'em in the eyes!"" depths of anguish in a few corny words. and a surprising amount of bitterness expressed by wounded veterans in a 1945 war film.   notes that might seem false to a contemporary viewer but perhaps shouldn't: the dated vernacular which it's difficult to believe many of today's kids could think was actually ever spoken -- ""private gab,"" ""dope"", ""drip,"" ""gee,"" ""you dumb coot,"" ""dame,"" ""a swell guy,"" and ""feeling sorry for yourself."" let us consider the historical context and be kind in our judgments. at the time, some of this goofy lingo was at the cutting edge.   real weak points? the wounded veterans get together and argue with each other about how much of a collective future they have and the argument is oversimply resolved with a conclusion along the lines of, ""just because you have a silver plate in your head doesn't mean people will think you're a bad person."" there are sometimes voice overs and silent prayers that are both unnecessary and downright unimaginative. ""please, god, let him return to me,"" and that sort of thing.   well, the film makers were operating within the constraints of their times. maybe that's why the final fade is on a shot of independence hall and the inspiring strains of ""america the beautiful"" swell in the back.   none of this can undo the film's virtues, which are considerable, particularly the impact of that horrifying combat scene. it's not on television that often. if you have a chance, by all means catch it.",1
"i couldn't believe my eyes once i've watched this movie. there's no point in it either then blood and violence. unlike other scary movies that had gore and a meaning to it this movie is just blood, gore, and killing one after another. this movie isn't interesting at all, has no meaningful plot or story line, nor does it have an intelligence in it. the blood looks very fake and this movie overall, is pointless. don't even waste your time with it. it's just an hour or two of mindless violence. it has many bloody scenes that aren't scary but just plain revolting. this is probably the worst horror film i have ever watched out of all the horror films i ever saw.",0
"in 2054 paris, avalon, a computer generated system, controls the city and when a young woman is kidnapped, detective karas (craig) must go against avalon to find her.  renaissance is a splendid blend of film making mixed with a conceptual futuristic narrative that lights up the screen in a shocking manor with a noir themed ideology and conceptual montages that should delight many.  pixar are the animation masters. their numerous oscar winning films are endless from the charming toy story to the mystifying wall-e and so any company or director has a real challenge to knock them of their perch. renaissance isn't a film aimed for the young audience though, and like 2007's persepolis, brings a strong and mature approach to the genre of animation to make an older and more challenging film to its targeted older generation.  in 2005 robert rodriguez released a shockingly brilliant noir sin city that shook up the whole usage of green screen with a splendid balance of filming in black and white with the odd spurts of colour and a year later, christian volckman took up a similar approach with this equally visually masterful stroke of film making.  volckman's picture however is a full on animation but it doesn't half look realistic for the majority of it's strong 1 hour and 40 minutes of running time. the faces of the character's are well portrayed and in particular, this film has got to be the finest ever for the usage of shadow. the fact we never know if its night or day is irrelevant when simply gazing into the stony faces as the shadows blend across their expressions. it is almost a clever use of pathetic fallacy, and is finely directed also.  for anyone who has seen persepolis you will have come to the conclusion it is one of the finest directed animations ever screened for the simple but highly conceptual artistic style by marjane satrapi  renaissance is equally on terms with that picture and in many instances rivals it with stronger graphics and a darker tone to reflect the mood. one scene in particular when karas appears out of darkness is beautifully shot.  the narrative revolves around a stubborn and nosey political government who keeps tabs on every citizen. the running of paris is down to the mysterious avalon which we don't see nearly enough to get an essence of its true dominance. renaissance is controlling the narrative around a tired cop's attempts to rescue the mysterious woman, and then we see craig's tired and boring cop attempt a rescue whilst battling with other elements. there are many things wrong with the scripting, not to mention the tired exasperated cop routine is now old, but there is plenty of dashing adrenaline and springy banter between characters to keep it alive right till a wonderfully shot shocking last couple of stages.",1
when the grinch came out i was excited though i thought it was going to be a happy go lucky film and it was. though it did have a little nightmare before christmas touch to it. you know kind of dark and spooky. i loved this film because it helped fill people with the christmas spirit. so mostly the grinch saved christmas. and what happened then well in whoville they say that the grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day. merry grinchmas!,1

"laurence olivier, merle oberon, ralph richardson, and binnie barnes star in ""the divorce of lady x,"" a 1938 comedy based on a play. olivier plays a young barrister, everard logan who allows oberon to spend the night in his hotel room, when the london fog is too dense for guests at a costume ball to go home. the next day, a friend of his, lord mere (richardson), announces that his wife (barnes) spent the night with another man at the same hotel, and he wants to divorce her. believing the woman to be oberon, olivier panics. oberon, who is single and the granddaughter of a judge, pretends that she's the lady in question, lady mere, when she's really leslie steele.  we've seen this plot or variations thereof dozens of time. with this cast, it's delightful. i mean, richardson and olivier? olivier and oberon, that great team in wuthering heights? pretty special. olivier is devastatingly handsome and does a great job with the comedy as he portrays the uptight, nervous barrister. oberon gives her role the right light touch. she looks extremely young here, fuller in the face, with jean harlow eyebrows and a very different hairdo for her. she wears some beautiful street clothes, though her first gown looks like a birthday cake, and in one gown she tries on, with that hair-do, she's ready to play snow white. binnie barnes is delightful as the real lady mere.  the color in this is a mess, and as others have mentioned, it could really use a restoration. definitely worth seeing.",1

"this is the french and belgians doing what they do best. it's quirky, visually inventive, exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling. director jaco van dormael takes us into the world of georges, a down's syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone, just anyone. this is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty. georges' interplay with corporate management guru, harry is dazzlingly handled - shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking ease.  the eighth day puts similar hollywood fare like barry levinson's oscar winning rain man or robert zemeckis's forrest gump well and truly in the shade. at times, it evokes the humour of milos forman's one flew over the cuckoo's nest with shades of dennis potter thrown in for good measure.  as the emotionally blunted and desperately lonely yuppie, harry, daniel auteuil turns in yet another sublime performance. but it is matched by the brilliant pascal duquenne as georges. it's a movie with uniformly strong performances and so many, memorable set pieces - the shoe shop scene, car showroom scene, george's dance to genesis's 'jesus he knows me,' the conference scene, the fireworks scene. if you haven't seen it, there's only one thing to do. just rent it or attend a screening at a retro cinema near you and see what you've been missing. better still, buy this movie. sheer genius.....",1
"just like al gore shook us up with his painfully honest and cleverly presented documentary-movie ""an inconvenient truth"", directors alastair fothergill and mark linfield also remind us that it's about time to improve our way of life in order to save our beautiful planet. ""planet earth"" is also a wake-up call that the global warming of our planet has disastrous consequences for all living creatures around the world. al gore showed us the bleak future of planet earth by presenting hard facts backed up by documented examples through long yet always interesting monologues. the creators of this documentary choose a different yet equally powerful way to accomplish this. they do not present us with a future representation of what might occur to our planet if we don't radically change things around, but they rather show us the genuine beauty of planet earth in all of its amazing glory. we see places that we knew that existed but never thought they could be so beautiful. in this movie, we see a wide array of the most extraordinary places such as forsaken deserts, giant forests full of fauna and flora and icy-landscapes as far as the eye could see. and in all of those immensely different environments, we see the most beautiful animals trying to survive.  this is exactly the kind of movie that had to be made, in combination with the one from al gore, in order to make us realize that our planet is too precious to meddle with. the voice-over by patrick stewart is always relaxing and thus very well done although at first it sounded as though i was watching an x-men movie instead! the cinematography is probably the most remarkable thing of this documentary. at times: what you see is so unreal that you tend to forget that a man with a camera actually had to film all of that delightful footage.  in short: this is definitely a must-see for everyone since it concerns every single person on this beautiful planet earth! the truth is: i never thought our planet was so astonishingly beautiful!",1
"in joel schumacher, you have one of the most inconsistent film makers of all time. but this is common knowledge; i think his main problem is the array of genres that he covers whilst at the same time, failing to develop any sort of certain style that might label him an auteur. hitchcock liked his suspense and his horror/thriller; chaplin liked his comedy; scorsese likes his crime driven mafia stories amongst others and spielberg likes his large scale, big budget adventure films that combine just enough violence for the adults and fun for the kids. other more obscure examples include kubrick and welles who covered too much to write about here.  but schumacher is the sort of guy who makes a flawed film revolving around a great idea or a really quite enjoyable film revolving around a seemingly dull premise. falling down had a great idea behind it but i found it flawed and anticlimactic with too many scenes seemingly relying on comedy. batman is a superhero; superhero films have been big hits recently so how he managed to make not one but two appalling superhero films is beyond me. then comes 8mm; a film with a basic premise that is executed in an impressive manner before tigerland which is schumacher's best film from what i've so far seen, in my opinion. with the war genre, laughter isn't something you'd associate with it for most of the time. i can remember scoffing at the absurdity of the d-day landings during saving private ryan: at the time when i first saw the film, i had not much knowledge of the second world war bar when it began and finished. my eyebrows were up, my mouth slightly open with a weak 'i can't believe it smile' on my face. needless to say, it was because of that film i searched out learning a bit more on what that event was all about and the war as a whole. in tigerland, you are invited to laugh at the absurdity of war through bozz (farrell), a tough and egotistical soldier training for the vietnam war.  but what's clever here is that there are no jaw dropping war scenes of fighting and death and destruction; just one man and his battle with the system for most of the time. the things he says and the audacity at which he deals with his predicament is reminiscent of a school child winding up a series of teachers at an extremely strict boarding school. tigerland may borrow from full metal jacket in the sense it is a training routine for the vietnam war but egos and superegos play more of a part here, i think. the superegos that are the drill sergeants go up against bozz whose ego is extremely large. there is also the third part of freud's triangle that sneaks into bozz: the id. compared to all the other soldiers who all have rather large egos, bozz is the only one brave enough to show it in front of the sergeants thus suggesting he is allows what he shouldn't do to float to the surface and express itself: ""you are all dead in this situation!"" barks a sergeant. ""any questions?"" ""yeah, if i'm dead how come i can ask a question?"" replies bozz whose punishments such as push-ups and dirt eating seem to un-faze him in true id style; that is he enjoys the punishments.  also regarding the superegos, bozz at one point tries to command a group of soldiers in field training. this is something the existing captain of the squad cannot do thus suggesting he is lacking in both the superego required for the job and the confidence to tell bozz he is in charge. what follows is an actual conversation between bozz and an existing drill sergeant who gives him his christian name. this is where private wilson's (whigham) character steps in: his uncontrollable rage and anger at bozz explodes at certain time all culminating in the film's only real scenes of a shootout which is in the form of a training exercise in a river. wilson cannot control his impulses and dislike toward bozz and acts out.  what i also liked about tigerland is that it's shot in such a way that is brave. while lacking in innovation, tigerland seems to use lower grade film stock or lesser cameras to get across its gritty look. make no mistake that this could have been a pretty looking film with lots of colour and attractiveness. but, we get a documentary approach in the final piece making everything look like it was shot on a typical everyday camera for tv; the emphasis on the hand held is also apparent but schumacher is clever: he never allows the film to become too much like a mockumentry whilst at the same time suggesting the film's budget could've been half of what it was. it's worth saying here that spielberg said he wanted saving private ryan to look like actual reel footage or something along those lines and as if it was recorded from the war scenes.  while being very funny and entertaining, tigerland is still a great study of what makes people tick; not necessarily in war but in the closest possible substitute. its study on one man and how much he hates the system that he cannot even take it seriously is fascinating as is the drive of each soldier. there are several memorable scenes and situations culminating in a happy, if not unhappy ending that'll open your mind and make you think about what it's perhaps really like in the military.",1

"when i was younger i really enjoyed watching bad television. we've all been guilty of it at some time or another, but my excuse for watching things like ""buck rogers in the 25th century"" and ""silver spoons"" is this: i was young and naive; ignorant of what makes a show really worthwhile.  thankfully, i now appreciate the good stuff. stargate sg-1 is not good. the 12 year-old me would love every hackneyed bit of it, every line of stilted dialogue, every bit of needless technobabble. the writing is beyond insipid; so bland and uninspired it makes one miss star trek: voyager. if your show makes me long for the worst trek show ever, you're in trouble.  the film stargate is a wonderful guilty pleasure, anchored by two solid performances by james spader and kurt russell, full of fascinating egyptian architecture and culture, a wonderful musical score, and cool sci-fi ideas. with the exception of a little of the original music, none of what made the film fun appears in this show. even richard dean anderson, who made macgyver watchable and legend interesting, seems like he's half asleep most episodes.  the budget must have been very low because the sets sometimes look like somebody's basement. the cinematography isn't much better, as vanilla and dull as the scripts. it amazes me that shows with a lot more style (like farscape) and substance (like the reimagined battlestar galactica) have smaller, less rabid fanbases than this pap. it just doesn't deserve it.",0

"most yeti pictures are fatally undermined by a grave paucity of energy and enthusiasm. not so this gloriously bent, batty and berserk over-the-top italian-made shot-in-canada kitsch gut-buster: it's a wildly ripe and vigorously moronic ghastly marvel which reaches a stunning apotheosis of righteously over-baked ""what the hell's going on?"" crackpot excess and inanity.  a freighter ship crew discovers the body of a 30-foot yeti that resembles a hirsute 70's disco stud (complete with jumbo wavy afro) perfectly preserved in a large chunk of ice. they dethaw the beast, jolt him back to life with electric charges, grossly mistreat him, and keep the poor hairy goliath in an enormous glass booth. before you can say ""hey, the filmmakers are obviously ripping off 'king kong',"" our titanic abominable snowdude breaks free of his cage, grabs the first luscious nubile blonde euro vixen (the gorgeous pheonix grant) he lays lustful eyes on, and storms away with his new lady love. the yeti gets recaptured and flown to toronto to be showed off to a gawking audience. of course, he breaks free again, nabs the vixen, and goes on the expected stomping around the city rampage.  the sublimely stupid dialogue (sample line: ""philosophy has no place in science, professor""), cheesy (far from) special effects (the horrendous transparent blue screen work and cruddy tonka toy miniatures are especially uproarious in their very jaw-dropping awfulness), clunky (mis)direction, and a heavy-handed script that even attempts a clumsily sincere ""is the yeti a man or a beast?"" ethical debate all combine together to create one of the single most delightfully ridiculous giant monster flicks to ever roar its absurd way across the big screen. better still, we also have a few funky offbeat touches to add extra shoddy spice to the already succulently schlocky cinematic brew: the vixen accidentally brushes against one of the yeti's nipples, which causes it to harden and elicits a big, leering grin of approval from the lecherous behemoth (!); the vixen nurses the yeti's wounded hand while he makes goo-goo eyes at her, the yeti smashes windows with his feet while climbing a towering office building, and the furry fellow even breaks a man's neck with his toes (!!). overall, this singularly screwball and shamefully unheralded should-be camp classic stands tall as a remarkable monolith of infectiously asinine celluloid lunacy that's eminently worthy of a substantial hardcore underground cult following.",1

"this is a modest, character driven comedy, filmed in brazil on a low budget. the premise is familiar, the same as in the 1950's danny kaye movie **on the double**: someone who, as a joke, does an impression of a famous person then is dragooned to impersonate the person for real.  the contrast between the two leads is highly effective. raul julia as the german-paradorian secret policeman, is tall, cool, menacing and latin. he sports a deliberately obvious blond dye job. richard dreyfus, animated, short, new york jewish, is funny and sympathetic. there are many references and inside jokes about show business.  the setting is clearly modeled on paraguay. paraguay was indeed ruled from the early fifties to the late eighties by gen. alfredo stroessner, an unelected military dictator whose father had emigrated from germany. but writer/director mazurszky reveals his ignorance of local conditions when he paints parador/paraguay as a typical latin american tyranny, with huge disparities in wealth and an active guerrilla insurgency. further in this vein, mazursky casts comic jonathan winters as an american retiree who in truth is c.i.a. station chief in parador and a figure so powerful that he can give the president of the country a profanity-laced chewing out.   in fact the u.s. has little influence in paraguay, which is largely without the social and racial tensions seen elsewhere in the region. this is due to the country's having fought long and costly wars against much larger neighbors in the 19th and 20th centuries. the male population was nearly wiped out both times but the society that emerged was patriotic, racially homogeneous and strongly united.   on yet another level, there is a bow to feminism in the form of the character madonna. played by brazilian actress sonia braga, madonna is a former nightclub dancer who is the body-stockinged presidential pleasure girl at the film's start but is seen on television as president herself at the end--now politically and cosmetically correct, no makeup, hair demurely pulled back, swept to office by a velvet revolution.  the one time that such an event actually happened in latin america, the administration of argentina's isabel peron (not the beloved evita, who never held office) lasted two years after the death of her husband, legendary **supremo** juan peron.",1

"""slaughter high"" is, perhaps, the most underrated slasher flick of the 1980s. it is one of the few films in the genre that is enthralling throughout. that being said, it also relies heavily on the standard slasher formula: a group of young men and women get killed one by one gruesomely until the final showdown.  the reason why ""slaughter high"" stands above most movies in its genre is that it goes more over-the-top. marty, the killer, has good reason to hold a grudge against his former classmates. they electrocuted him as he stood naked in a girl's locker room shower, jabbed at his crotch with a javelin, and, to top it off, rigged his science lab experiment so it could disfigure him.  so, the victims in this movie are about as unlikeable as you get. when they reunite years later -- at a high school reunion put on by marty himself -- you realize they haven't matured all that much. they're a bunch of sociopaths.  it is mind-boggling why they would not wonder why they were the only ones to show up to the reunion, which, by the way, is held at a school that has since fell into disrepair. and who would think it's a good idea to drink beer and liquor found in the abandoned building in a room that happens to have their old lockers -- as well as marty's -- on display? there are many leaps of faith the viewer needs to take to enjoy this film. the ending makes little or no sense. and the screenwriters have a strange understanding of how april fool's day works: the movie claims that pranks are no longer allowed after noon.  in all, the movie is one of the best examples of the slasher genre, despite all of its flaws. it is hard to understand why it hasn't yet found its way to dvd, when so many other run-of-the-mill slasher flicks are graced with special editions.",1
"this film actually manages to be mindless enjoyment for 2/3 of the journey. sadly, the film ends up being too 'confused.' while i know some of the plot contrivances are standard of 'buddy cop' films i got drawn in to the characters who foil each other brilliantly but in the end the film relies too much on chase sequences as a crutch and i lost interest.  the filmmakers did a great job of getting the characters alone and doing their own thing and we got to see who they are and identified with both cops early on. we formed our own opinion instead of being force fed a view of them through constant bickering.  in the end there is too much going on and it detracts greatly from what could've been an enjoyable piece of escapism. here's what's concerning joe gavilan (harrison ford) at the end of the film:  1. his real estate deals 2. his affair with a radio psychic 3. he's being investigated by internal affairs 4. the homicide investigation  if you add in casey's concerns you fond out he wants to be an actor and avenge his father's death. now some of these things do come together and even come together well but all the plot elements come together amidst this bogus chase that is so long and pathetic that i hardly have time to break my ennui and give a crap about what just happen. the impressive screenwriting acrobatics cannot overcome the bad filmmaking.  as if a ridiculous chase sequence wasn't bad enough, one which has four separate sections and could last close to half an hour, wasn't bad enough, joe gavilan fields calls about his real estate deal while chasing the perpetrator with a gun. all these extra-curricular plot lines and jokes make it absolutely meaningless to me whether or not the criminal gets caught. we already forgot or no longer care about the murder plot at this point because multiple plot-lines and eye candy of the chases have numbed us beyond all comprehension.  while i could go on about the chases and how they ruin a decent story, i won't. this could've been a very enjoyable formula film but it got much too big for its britches and it turned into a redundant waste of time. harrison ford and josh hartnett actually did rather well and a small appearance by gladys knight is worth noting. sadly none of the actors can help this hopelessly misguided film from being forgettable.  while this will probably be better than the likes of ""the hulk"" and ""lara croft ii"" that still doesn't make this film good. i once heard that harrison ford claimed to only make films that eh thought would make money, i'm not sure if that's true or not. what is true is that to get great box office you don't need a great movie or a great actor, this film has neither in its lead roles. my advice to harrison ford would be: to stick to indiana jones because at least you can still run.",0

"in a future society, the military component does not have to recruit; rather, their candidates are chosen at birth, culled from nurseries and designated to spend their entire lives in the service of the government. they are given over to the war machine, body and soul, for no reason other than to protect and serve; they have no personal identity other than a name and rank, and no autonomy whatsoever. this is the fate of those whose destiny is predetermined for them in `soldier,' directed by paul anderson and starring kurt russell. the scenario is hard and bleak as the movie begins by depicting the training of the soldiers during advancing periods of time, from preadolescence to adulthood. russell is sergeant todd, the best of the best, and we glimpse his career as he discharges his duties in an exemplary manner in campaign after campaign; he is what he was born to be, a soldier. but even the best cannot go on forever, and the day arrives when todd and his peers are no longer the elite. a new generation of soldiers has been created, products of advanced genetics and technology, and todd's generation is suddenly obsolete. what follows is the story of a man who must fight for his life, while struggling to discover his own sense of humanity and individuality, traits new to a soldier who has known only two things his entire life: fear and discipline. russell gives a commanding performance as todd, the soldier who above all else must obey orders without question while suppressing all emotion and individual thoughts. he has few lines in this movie, but russell speaks volumes with his eyes. this role demonstrates that he is, in fact, one of the under-appreciated actors of our times; that he can disappear so entirely into the character of todd is a credit to his ability, and with this part he has created someone quite different from any he's done before. and he's given todd a depth and credibility that someone of lesser talent could easily have rendered as nothing more than a pretentious and superficial stereotype. notable performances are also turned in here by connie nielsen (sandra) and jason isaacs (colonel mekum). rounding out the supporting cast are jason scott lee, memorable as caine 607, one of the new generation of soldiers; sean pertwee (mace); gary busey (captain church); michael chiklis (jimmy pig); and mark bringleson (rubrick). anderson has delivered an action film with a message, a cautionary tale that transcends the genre of science-fiction. `soldier' reminds us of the importance of keeping the humanity of our lives intact. it's an entertaining way of making us consider the alternatives, like a bleak future and a world in which good movies just wouldn't make a whole lot of difference. much like `1984,' and `mad max,' this movie, which is ultimately uplifting, is going to make you take pause and think about the kind of universe in which we all must live together and share. i rate this one 7/10.",1
"i was a huge fan of the original cartoon series, and was looking forward to finally seeing gadget on the big screen -- but i never in my wildest dreams expected something so extremely extremely terrible. the pace was way too fast, there was no plot, and 'wowser!' - what the hell is that?? it was 'wowsers!!'.",0
"sudden impact is the 4th of the dirty harry films and one of the best traits of these films is that they don't really degrade in quality from one film to the next. thus, sudden impact provides another thrill ride through the life of dirty harry callahan. this time harry attempts to solve a series of murders while on vacation. harry's always on the job it seems. clint eastwood plays harry as he plays all his men of action, slow, deliberate, and without fear. as the first of the dirty harry films to be made in the 80's, sudden impact lacks a bit of the 70's feel that characterizes the first three films. this doesn't mean that it's quality is any less. bottom line: brimming with intensity and action, sudden impact is another worthy addition to the dirty harry series.",1
"you know when you're on the bus and someone decides to tell you their life-story, and you sit there with a pathetic smile on your face when all you really want to do is slap the fool and walk off? well i had a similar sensation while watching this film. okay, i did actually choose to go and see aprile, and i knew about nanni moretti's taste for making himself the one and only star from caro diario, but after about half an hour of this latest installment from his memoirs i wanted to give moretti the madre of all slaps. caro diario was funny, unusual, and at least a couple of other characters managed to get a word in edgeways. in aprile, however, moretti has exclusive rights to the dialogue, so that all you hear for an hour and a half is a high-pitched whine going on about how his politics are best, or what quirky piece of popular culture is tickling his fancy at the moment. he also finds time to slag off films that he doesn't like, something i thought was reserved for losers like me. surely being in a position like his you'd think he'd try and make a point about cinema a little more intelligently than this. by making a proper film perhaps, one with some ideas and a decent structure, or maybe one that isn't completely dominated by his annoying voice. and when he started fawning over his newborn baby, i just wanted to go and be in the company of someone normal, preferably not a self-obsessed film director with a strange penchant for tacky music. the next time someone you don't know tries to tell you their life-story, give them a slap from me. every blow will be a small victory in the fight against morettiism.",0
"on this 4th of july weekend it's heartening to see the spirit of the declaration of independence alive and well in the film ""war, inc."" just as our founding fathers gave the back of their collective hand to king george iii, this film exposes in hilarious fashion the craven war-profiteering by the current crop of capitalistic creeps who are intent on indecently privatizing the government, to include privatizing war itself.  the cast in this satire absolutely shines. john cusack is wonderful as a droll, conflicted corporate assassin, and the beautiful marisa tomei is superb as his love interest. (my gosh, ""george costanza"" was right. marisa tomei is so attractive!) but it is john's sister joan cusack who really steals the film. her portrayal of a bossy, yet simultaneously sycophantic, personal assistant is priceless, and more than once i just couldn't stop laughing at the brilliance of her performance. she not only possesses fantastic comic timing, her face is as expressive as one could ever wish for in an actor. dan ackroyd, too, has a short, but very effective, cameo in the film as the head of the company which is running the war, the tamerlane corporation. sitting on a ""throne"" with his pants down around his ankles, ackroyd even looks like the arse clown who currently occupies one of our real thrones of power. you won't have to think too hard to recognize that person. much of this movie was filmed in bulgaria, which is why we are able to see so much real military equipment. (you just know that the us military would never have cooperated in making this satiric expose of war-profiteering.) i especially enjoyed the character of ""omar sharif"" as played by the bulgarian actor lyubomir neikov. in one scene in which he is on the dance floor with marisa tomei he has a couple of lines that could summarize our entire foreign policy attitude toward the foreign leaders we install - and uninstall - in power.  naturally, this film won't appeal to everyone. if you believe that the on-going privatization of our foreign policy, the military, intelligence collection and analysis, prisons and the corrections system, public health, and a myriad of other government services is a good thing you may not find much to like in this film. if you believe, however, that destroying people and countries in order to add to some corporation's bottom line is an abomination i think you'll find much to appreciate in this film. nothing could be more in keeping with the spirit of independence that heaping well-deserved ridicule on corrupt powers that be.",1
"revolutions always present opportunities for dramatic films since, in fact, most revolutions are in themselves dramatic events. unfortunately, what this film lacks in drama is compensated for by an overabundance of boredom. one cares not who wins, loses, dies or lives--just end it as soon as possible. this is due in large measure to what seems to me to be a superficial use of background technology. scenes of paris and the french countryside have a cardboard quality about them. they might better be done on a bare stage and left that way. one cannot expect the amazing effects of ""the house of the flying daggers"" or ""the golden compass,"" but , after all, this is a 2002 digitally mastered production. characters seem to enter a scene for the sake of entering a scene, so much so that one loses count of the number of times character enter and leave rooms. in my view, this film turns the french revolution of the 1790s into the ""papier-mache"" revolution of a ""papier colle"" world.",0
"i saw this movie as a child and it broke my heart! no other story had such a unfinished ending... i grew up on many great anime movies and this was one of my favourites, because it was so unusual - a story about unfairness, and cruelty, and loneliness, and life, and choices that can't be undone, and the need for others. chirin is made alone when the wolf kills his mother, but the wolf is alone, too, when chirin follows him into the mountain. the wolf doesn't kill the lamb, even though each night he says ""maybe i'll eat you tomorrow."" the tape of it i have is broken and degraded from age and use. i will repair it and watch the movie again someday and cry just as hard as i did as a child. stories like this, with this depth and feeling, and this intricacy of meaning, are very rare. it is a sad story, but i've never encountered any catharsis more beautifully made. i am glad i have seen this movie, and i'm glad i saw it as a child.",1
"i actually saw china o'brien ii before i ever saw the original china o'brien. and i have to say that the first incarnation is actually worse. but: worse = funnier! and funnier = better. if you're a bad movie fan like i am, this is great material. if, however, you are looking for any sort of meaningful plot, acting ability, or movie-making skill, this is best avoided. the best part is how they filmed all the fighting sequences in stuttering fast-forward. hilariously bad. see it for a laugh, see it for mindless entertainment, but whatever you do, see it for free on tv.",0

"corbin bernsen's sent letters to four criminal associates he's worked with in the past and it's a real intergenerational mix with fred gwynne, lou diamond phillips, william russ, and ruben blades. they're to meet him in this obscure montana town and he doesn't explain why because he's then picked up by out of state police from new jersey on a warrant.   of the criminal group that's been gathered together, they all know bernsen, but don't know each other. a lot of comedy involved is them feeling each other out. as the oldest gwynne though denying it kind of takes charge with the others grumbling, but going along. especially when they figure out what bernsen had in mind.  as for bernsen, he's got the good fortune to be picked up by a pair of bumblers in ed o'neill and daniel roebuck. he gets the drop on o'neill and escapes.  after that it's the four criminals trying to finish what bernsen started and bernsen getting away the police. in the intricately plotted screenplay, it's fascinating how both story lines keep intertwining with each other. hoyt axton as the local sheriff watches in amazement at what unfolds in his town.  disorganized crime is a fabulously funny caper film by a bunch of players who seem mostly to have had a background in television or would soon. i can't say that anyone stood out in the cast they also seem to click so well together.   ironically none of these people are comedians per se, but they all exhibit a light comic touch that good directing brought out.   disorganized crime is one very funny caper movie, the kind of film that well known pessimist mr. murphy would have written.",1
"i enjoyed this film. it was lighthearted, delightful, and very colorful. you can see that mgm was showing off technicolor. there are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film. every scene is packed full. the choreography was great. gene kelly is a wonder. he is so talented. the dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed, and perfectly designed. he understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else. the last section of the film, the grand dance sequence, is very impressive. what makes this film very special is gershwin's music. few american composers have had a better gift for melody. i very much enjoy gershwin's music. it is enchanting. ira gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers. he is so witty and charming. this was a highly entertaining film.",1

"  i have seen this movie many times. at least a dozen. but unfortunatly not recently. however, etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which mickey rooney, -""killer mears"" knows that he is to be executed and it's getting close to the moment of truth, he dances, and cries, and laughs, he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion. never have i seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead, past or present. it was then i know for sure that mickey rooney, yes, ""andy hardy"" was and is a actor of great genius. however i kept it, my opinion to myself for years thinking, surely i must be alone in this viewpoint. about 15 years or so after i saw this film for the last time on television, i chanced to read the old q & a section of the los angeles times. the question was posed to lawrence olivier, and the question was: ""mr. olivier you are considered one of the greatest actors of all time, whom then do you consider to be among the greatest actors?"" his answer was, ""peter finch and mickey rooney"" i was stunned, but not surprised. i immediatly flashed back to his ""killer mears"" and i felt very good for having seen this great ability in him, and now having my view supported by another whos work i admired.. later of course there was ""bill"" and many other great moments with mikey rooney. this film, ""the last mile"" should be seen by all acting students. i frankly cannot remember a great deal about the film after all these years but mr. rooney in it, will never leave me. if anyone out there remembers this film the same as i do? i would be interested in hearing from you. for this picture etched in my heart alone i gave it a 10 just on the face of his performance.",1
this movie is about a fictional soap opera. it is very fast and funny. to say anything else would ruin the movie. there are several plots and sub plots in the movie. this movie has ensemble cast with today's hottest stars. they all gives over the top performances. this movie is favorite of mine from the year 1991. soapdish is perfect for fans of either daytime soap opera /or prime time soap opera!!!if you watch soap go check this movie it's hilarious!!!,1
"as a long-standing barbra fan, any posting like this will be biased. that aside, this film ranks as a classic. it has it's flaws (emphasized in other postings), but gives a glimpse of a time (late 70s) that will never be there again, and is fascinating to watch unfold on screen.  streisand fought hard to make this movie her own. i don't think she was ever satisfied. but it gives her fans a new barbra (for the time) with live singing, a young fresh appearance, and some very heavy-duty acting.  the story is rough, but exciting, and holds your interest throughout. the extended one frame ""finale"" is hard for most non-barbra fans to sit through, but it speaks volumes to those who admire her talent.

"this movie is about a side of ireland that americans don't normally see, the narrow-minded religiously prejudiced side of the 'friendliest race in the world'. the movie, by the admission of the inhabitants of fethard who are old enough to remember the events, is fairly accurate (though they insist that the film-makers invented some of the more violent scenes just to spice up the action).  the movie was very unpopular in ireland as it portrayed the catholic church in a bad light, but the simple fact is that representatives of the catholic church *did* organise vetoes of minorities (before protestants it was the jews).  the film is a fascinating insight into the whole issue of religion in ireland",1
"this was just another marvelous film of the berlin festival. but unlike ""yes"", by sally potter, which i had seen some days before, where after leaving the cinema i felt a strong desire of wishing to embrace the whole world and was just happy to be alive, this time quite the opposite thing happened: there was something that dragged me down, and the air suddenly felt cold and hard to breathe. it was as if, all of a sudden, there was nothing left, all hope, all future had been taken away to a dead place.  nina's life seemed to be dismal and locked, but then, one lovely day, there appears that kind of luminosity that opens up the horizon and makes her believe in the fulfillment of her dreams. there was nobody at her side but suddenly she finds a companion, just out of nothing, someone who was able to share the most hidden feelings of her life. that person was toni, a vagabond girl who does not seem to have any roots, just like herself.  but the film's title is ""ghosts"", and ghosts appear and disappear as they wish, there is no way to retain them ghosts also represent the hidden fantasies of people, strange ideas that occupy your mind and are only perceived by yourself, hiding away from all other people. françoise, a french woman, is a victim of such ghosts. she once lost her child daughter in berlin, who apparently had been robbed from her in a supermarket, in just one moment of inattentiveness. now time has passed, and françoise is back in berlin, still looking for the missing child.  nina could be that child, after all she has got that same scar at her ankle and the heart-shaped birthmark between her shoulder blades which seems to prove her true identity.  and nina adopts that idea, after all she is not only in desperate need of a companion, she also longs for a mother. but in the end she is empty-handed, toni has disappeared with a man, and her supposed mum turns out to be a sick woman. ""marie is dead,"" concludes françoise's husband, and the statement could not be more disillusioning. nina is just a ""niña"", a girl without name, there is no hope for any divine fulfillment. there is no marie in this world to accompany our lonely lives. therefore, in the end, we see nina all alone, about to walk along the road that has opened up before her, into a future that seems joyless and uncertain.",1

"no cinematic achievements here, however that's not even the important question. how does it fare in its endeavour to be a competent date movie--and star vehicle?  the formula requires the cute female lead a la ryan or aniston--check; there's a built-in tv audience!  add thick-headed, compliant men, usually including the problem ex-boyfriend/fiancée--check.   assemble a plot that maximizes the bankability of the stars. so far, so good.  what is the male lead to consist of? he has to make all the women in the movie and in the audience (and the gay flight stewards) instantly swoon. but...he cannot be so hunky as to threaten to the male audience, and he can't outshine the star. roll cameras...  the problem is messing thinks she's still in a sitcom...she has only one presentation: as the wide-eyed doormat that she's made a career out of. a capable actress might have pulled it off after the love scene, where things promptly nosedive into the soap suds.   you can't help feeling good for mulroney...you can read it in his face that he sees through all of this. he's gotten all the respect of a lifetime .260 hitter. this time, he smacks one out to the warning track, and no one can figure out what to do, as he amusedly takes home plate.",0
"to say this film is simply a demonisation of catholics and a misrepresentation of history is untrue. that is not what this film is.  what this film is is a comment on the abuses of the church (although this could be substituted for any powerful body), the ways that this abuse affects people and families and the way so many people choose to simply allow and often participate in the abuse without thinking for themselves. the fact that it is the catholic church which is in the wrong is simply because of the nature of the true story the film is based upon. to label this as propaganda against catholics seems to miss the truth about what the catholic church has done at times; its history is often not great and is something that films like this highlight and that needs to be highlighted. yes we should comment on the abuses committed by other organisations but that is not for the remit of this film.  it is an amazing film which brought me to tears and well worth watching - 'if we do not study the past, we are bound to repeat it'",1

"i give this five out of 10. all five marks are for hendrix who delivers a very decent set of his latter day material. unfortunately the quality of the camera work and editing is verging on the appalling! we have countless full-face shots of hendrix where he could almost be doing anything, taking a pee perhaps? we don't see his hands on the guitar thats the point! also we're given plenty shots of hendrix from behind? there appears to be three cameras on hendrix, but amateur fools operate all of them. the guy in front of hendrix seems to be keen to wander his focus lazily about the stage as if hendrix on the guitar is a mere distraction. while the guy behind is keener on zeroing in on a few chicks in the stalls than actually documenting the incredible guitar work thats bleeding out the amps (the sound recording is good thanks to wally heider) interspersed on the tracks are clips of student losers protesting against vietnam etc on tracks like machine gun, complete waste of film! if hendrix had lived even another two years berkeley is one of those things that would never have seen the light of day as far as a complete official release goes. the one gem it does contain is the incredible johnny b good but all in a pretty poor visual document of the great man and inferior to both woodstock and isle of wight",0
"well, maybe i'm just having a bad run with hindi movies lately. i asked the video store guy for apharan (prakash jha) but being a new release, wasn't available yet. so i had to settle for this one. it turned out to be the stupidest hindi movie i've seen (and i've seen quite a few). no wonder bollywood is the laughing stock of the whole world! if imdb had negative ratings, i would give garam masala a -10.  i remember seeing a tv show about the jazzy premiere they had for its release in mumbai. all the usual celebs and their sideys showed up. for some strange reason, people expect good stuff from piyadarashan. i did not like hulchul, hungama, or his other films. hulchul, probably dubbed from tamil or telugu, came across as very loud, in-your-face fare that again didn't make much sense except in a bollywood flick. this latest piece of utter cxxp proved that this guy has no brains. who made him a director, even a bollywood director at that???   anyhow, to the film now. what starts off as a romantic escapade turns into a non-sensical woman-hunt. two fashion photographers working for a magazine share an apartment (isn't it similar to no entry where the 2 dudes work for a gossip magazine and share an office? jezuz christ, now they're copying their own stories!) well anyways, there's some cook or chef that tries to help one of the dodos in his quest for multi-lateral love (aka multi-tasking + multi-timing). what happened in the end, i've no idea. i switched off mid-way. what ridiculous junk. i can't believe they even released it. and how sadistic to wallow in their own filth! for which audience did they make it - the poor illiterate indian masses (700 mil at last count) or the well-heeled nri desis staying in phoren? either ways it doesn't matter. neither group has any clue what makes a good movie and probably deserves such god-awful stuff.  its a short review because there's nothing to write about but the usual bag of f-grade garbage. bollywood should change its name to follywood. and yes, this review is much better than the movie itself.",0
"spoilers.  first off, nothing really happened in this movie, other than a woman bleeding inexplicably. second, it wasn't scary. third, it had the worst soundtrack of any movie ever. let me elaborate. the sound was edited by either beavis or butthead  i'm not sure which, so let's just go with beavis. the movie gradually gets more and more quiet and the people mumble and mutter, forcing you to turn up the volume (i watched this at home). then beavis blasts some really loud sounds with supposedly scary/shocking images, forcing you to quickly lower the volume again. this occurs many times until, mercifully, the movie ends. i can picture beavis laughing vulgarly from behind the two-way mirror while watching the test group franticly reaching for the remote each time. if you have children and prefer to watch scary movies after they fall asleep, this one is a big mistake. but then it's a big mistake anyway. here's a thought  if you're going to make a horror movie, at least add a gratuitous beheading, a 19-year-old blond girl who screams at the top of her lungs just before she can take off her sweater, the shadow on the wall of someone being eaten alive just out of the camera range, a cat being thrown at the camera to scare the audience, some drifty weirdo with a maniacal laugh, or a monster who looks like a stage hand covered in aluminum foil (a la tv's lost in space). these people didn't even try to scare me. they just wanted to hurt my ears.",0
"directed by brian de palma and written by oliver stone, ""scarface"" is a movie that will not be forgotten. a cuban refugee named tony montana (pacino) comes to america for the american dream. montana then becomes the ""king"" in the drug world as he ruthlessly runs his empire of crime in miami, florida. this gangster movie is very violent, and some scenes are unpleasant to watch. this movie has around 180+ f-words and is almost three hours long. this movie is entertaining and you will never get bored. you cheer for the drug-lord, and in some scenes you find out that montana isn't as evil as some other crime lords. this is a masterpiece and i recommend that you see this. you will not be disappointed. 9/10",1
"this clunker of a film sets a new standard for bad filmmaking. jared rushton gives an adequate performance of a very poorly-created character in an ill-fated movie, thereby creating a net effect of a very bad movie. the film's main thrust is how a boy's temporary excursion into the canadian wilderness after surviving a plane crash solo allows the disgruntled adolescent to deal with his anguish over discovering his mother's extramarital affair. unfortunately it turns into a bizarre collage of random ""survival events"" (including two especially hokey scenes involving fighting a bear) and strange hallucinations that make you wonder if this kid isn't just sitting in an alley somewhere on pot dreaming up this whole movie (and what a nightmare it is!). furthermore, despite the heralds of some reviewers of the family viewability of the film, there are several scenes not suitable for very young children or family viewing, including a graphic scene of the dead pilot underwater with one of his eyes apparently exploded.  all in all, a terrible movie that nobody should be subjected to, much less innocent kids.",0

"just after the end of wwii powell & pressburger were asked to come up with something to try to heal the rift developing between the uk & the usa. at the time there was a lot of ""overpaid, over sexed and over here"" type of comments. somehow they came up with this masterpiece.  my favourite movie of all time. it's got everything. romance, poetry, emotion, religion, drama and very quirky.  i can never explain exactly why, but it hits all the right buttons and although i've seen it hundreds of times (yes, really) i'm still guaranteed to be in tears at many points throughout.  was it the magnificent acting, the wonderful sets, the inspired script ? who knows. but *do* watch it and you'll see what i mean.",1
"hard to categorize the film - perhaps it's an avant garde spy thriller? mother night is a very good vonnegut novel, and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film. the film adaptation is very faithful to the original book. the ""indie"" approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big hollywood studio financing it. these days, i doubt an intelligent novel like mother night would ever get the green light from the big hollywood grindhouses. and normally that is too bad, but not in this case. mother night has tight direction and a solid cast. nick nolte who seems to be getting better roles as he gets older, still has that ""everyman"" persona that allows him to take on a wide range of different characters. sheryl lee is beautiful and great as always. i always thought she deserved better than she got out of the entertainment industry. i guess making your debut as a dead girl (twin peaks)with little air time isn't the choicest of roles, even if the tv show becomes a minor phenomenon. anyway this film is totally enjoyable and you don't have to read the book to understand the movie. in fact, given today's geopolitical realities, the novel's premise may appear dated, and some younger viewers with little knowledge of history will be utterly confused by the events unfolding (i am talking to you, fellow americans who are students and scoring the lowest in the industrialized world in geography, history, and lord knows what other subjects!).",1
"80 minutes, and it felt twice that long! brief crossing is not brief enough. indeed, the first 50 minutes or so consist almost entirely of a dialogue (more of a monologue, really) of a woman approaching middle age, tediously droning about ""men,"" disappointment, sex, aging, and her recent breakup, to a french teenager she met in the ship's cafeteria.  the tedious monologue continues as they go to duty-free shop, and to a bar, where finally her self-involved rant pushes him away. the ""story"" can't end there, of course, so she persuades him to listen to her drone on more as she brings him to her cabin.  what little romance, sex, or for that matter, anything at all this film has besides bitter rantings is hardly enough to justify the price of a rental unless you are one of those who love dramas where nothing interesting happens at all. yes, the ending is very nicely done, but it is scant reward to subject yourself to what amounts to a turning your living room into a virtual therapy session with a narcissistic whiner.  of course, some people like it. i could be wrong.",0
"this is a truly terrible film.  i'm only writing this so that some people somewhere are put off watching it. if i have stopped one person from wasting some of their precious life watching this film i shall die happy.  unutterably dull, although since it stars al pacino i was fooled into thinking that at any moment something interesting was going to happen. then the credits rolled, and i realised i had been completely fooled into watching this unbelievable drivel.  i cannot believe that this film has achieved as high a score as it has at imdb (over 5 stars when i last saw the voting). are you people voting ironically?  please, please, please do not watch this film!",0
"more wide-eyed, hysterical 50s hyper-cheerfulness that gives new meaning to anti-social, pathological behaviour. danza and grayson will leave you begging for mercy.  it's a shame that all the people involved in the making of this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). i kinda thought about suing them for torture. as this movie started unleashing its shamelessly aggressive operatic assault onto my poor, defenseless ear-drums, i felt instant, strong pain envelop my entire being. that damn muscular vibrato can shatter soviet tanks into tiny bits, nevermind glass.  ""why didn't you switch the channel if you didn't like it?"", you might ask angrily. fair point, fair point... the answer is that i wanted to, but the pain was so sudden and excruciating that i fell to the floor, writhing in agony. with my last ounces of energy, i tried to reach the remote but couldn't.  a silly little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is discovered by niven, who then proceeds to ""pigmalionize"" him. lanza is in love with asymmetrical grayson, but she predictably treats him with contempt until they finally hook up. this may seem like a rather thin plot, but this noisy movie is so chock-full of singing and music that there is barely any dialogue at all. this movie is relentless. forget about torturing hippies and war prisoners with slayer's ""reign in blood"" (as in a south park episode). whatever little conversation there is amongst the silly adults that infest this strange 50s musical world, it's all infantile - as if they were all 6 year-olds impersonating grown-ups. i can only envy people who find movies like this funny. it must be great being easy-to-please: what a world of wonder would open up to me if only i could enjoy any silly old gag as hilarious, gut-busting comedy.   but let's examine this phenomenon, the 50s musical. my best guess is that 50s musicals offered the more day-dreaming idealists among us a glimpse into utopia or heaven (depending on whether you're church-going or lenin's-tomb-going), or at least very cheesy version of these fantasy-inspired places. ttono is more akin to a representation of hell, but that's just me. i don't seem to ""get"" musicals. people talk, there is a story - but then all-of-a-sudden everyone starts singing for about 4 minutes after which they abruptly calm down and then pretend as if nothing unusual happened! when you think about it, musicals are stranger than any science-fiction film.  worse yet, ttono (my favourite type of pizza, btw) is not just a 50s musical, but one with opera squealing. opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes an ear-piercing weapon rather than a means of bringing the listener pleasure. the clearest example of this travesty is when lanza and grayson unite their dark side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet. i tried lowering the volume. i lowered it from 18 to 14. then from 14 to 10. then 8. i ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually so low that it's only heard by specially-trained dogs and certain types of marsupials, and yet i still could hear those two braying like donkeys!  take the scene in the small boat in the river. danza starts off with one of his deafening, brain-killing tunes, and then... nothing. no animals anywhere to be seen. even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have all but left. if you look carefully, you might even see the trees change colour, from green to yellow, in a matter of minutes. no, this was not a continuity error, it was plain old torture of the flora. and those trees were just matte paintings! imagine how real trees would have reacted.  the reason glass breaks when a high c is belched out of the overweight belly of an operatic screamer is not due to any laws of physics relating to waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - hence can take only so much pain before committing suicide through spontaneous self-explosion. i can listen to the loudest, least friendly death metal band for hours, but give me just a minute of a soprano and i get a splitting headache.",0
"i remember when i was five and my parents thought it was a regular cartoon movie....except when the bras and bullets started flying. i have to agree this movie will make anyone and everyone upset because it is set to discriminate everyone and anyone....but the truth is it is funny as hell as it is deep. i recommend this to anyone who likes cult classics. also try fritz the cat and the nine lives of fritz the cat. if i'm correct ralph bashki did that movie too.it involves a cat that goes through hard times with family, streets,jobs , etc. when i was old enough i rented all of these movies out. because coonskin was an offensive title during that era it was also labeled as street fighter. ralph bashki also made cool world starring a very young brad pitt. heavy traffic was another cartoon that dealt with the street life of a young man.",1
"this movie got extremely silly when things started to happen. i couldn't care less about any of the characters; susan walters was so annoying, and the leading actor (forget his name) also got on my nerves. can't quite remember how it ended and so forth but the whole idea of aliens possessing human bodies and all just seemed stupid in this film, things didn't quite carry off. my dad told me it's s stupid movie...i should've listened to him.",0
"what happened in the making of this movie so that it ended up as the total mess it is? just one year after ""the breakfast club"", a brilliant movie with many of the same actors as in ""st. elmo's fire"" (who by the way looked and acted in the latter more like they were still the high school misfits from the former but without the grip or discipline in portraying their roles.  was it the directing or the writing. since it was the same person (joel schumacher) it must be both. but then schumacher has since given us ""the phantom of the opera"", ""phone booth"", ""a time to kill"", and two batman movies, ""batman and robin"" and ""batman forever"" which range from good to great directing. something went wrong on ""stef"" because it has no genius whatsoever, no comedy worth anything, and is very far off the mark on what is truly valuable in life.   example: the character wendy (a rich little girl with a heart to do good and help the less fortunate played by mare winningham ) reveals to billy (an unruly slob who cheats on his wife and on his girlfriends, drinks far too much and has no sense of order in his life appropriately played by rob lowe) that she is still a virgin. billy truly see a challenge and possible conquest but wendy ""is not ready"". wendy, in fact is so not ready it is hard to believe she is in this clique of friends. later in the story, when billy whose wife has left him taken his child and married another has somehow drawn some of the strings of his life together. billy is leaving for new york, deserting and abandoning all parental responsibility for his baby daughter, he convinces wendy that her virginity would be the perfect ""going away gift"" from her to him. and wendy, who works as a social worker helping broken families, seems not to be phased at all by this despot. give me a break. the one thing she can only give once, she gives to a loser who is leaving his family and friends? schumacher frames this scene as a wonderful and touching moment.  many more example exist where there is a complete disconnect between what is real and of value being tossed overboard and the acts are made to look like virtue.  i suppose some may say that ""that was the 80's"" but i remember it was in the ""80's"" that men began to be held responsible for the children they fathered whether in a marriage or out.  i think this movie is so bad because it is so out of sync with what it really valuable and right.  as for the technique (not the story), it was terrible as well. it is disjointed and feels like a 3 hour movie that has been edited to 1 hour and 40 minutes. transitions and jumps in time simply do not make sense. pick up what is on the editing room floor, put it back in and the movie would probably flow much better...but it still is a horrible movie.  maybe schumacher has become a better and stronger director since 1986 (he must have) or maybe he was over his head when it came to writing the screenplay for st elmo's fire or maybe this group of actors took over the set and went their own way - that is what i really think happened.",0

"this movie is such cheesy goodness.  a bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school. they start getting killed off, they know they are being stalked, so what do they do? one girl decides to take a bath, another decides to cheat on her husband (who is also there) with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed (in an old abandoned school?) and go at it.  and it comes through with the gore and the t&a.  and it's also interesting from a historical/sociological point of view. where the usual 80's slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves, or how adults view young people, or as hollywood views the rest of the country this has a unique perspective. this is a brit film made to be an american slasher. it's hilarious to see how often the british actors who are trying to speak ""american"" unintentionally slip back in to their uk accents.  if you like cheesy 80's slashers (like pieces) then you will like this one.",1
"well...the movie was a fun watch. the main problem with this movie is the fact that it goes against everything that most vampire myths abide by. like vampires that walk in the sunlight. though there are parts that just make you enjoy the way society makes movies. a scene where a vampire gets stabbed and screams ""ow this hurts...it's really stuck."" then there seems like there might be scenes missing but you get used to after a while. and there are random dream sequenes' that really don't help with the plot. come to think of it, nothing really made sense, but i just got a bunch of friends and watched it twice to get the full effect. come to think of it the fight scenes were aweful, and the zombies were just fun to watch. slowly as i write more of this i like this movie more. but you know, all in all you can't expect schindlers list but its a fun watch.",0

"blackadder 3 is probably the blackadder series that people have least heard of - it has basically the same principles as the second and fourth ones and has nothing revolutionary in it. but it is still great - a fiery duke of wellington and a fat foolish dr johnson (writer of the first dictionary in england) make this series one to be reckoned with. there are still more hilarious one-liners to be delivered in this series, and it brings out the humour in a lesser-known era - in historically accurate and enjoyable episodes. blackadder's third outing is not the most famous and well-known of the lot, but rowan atkinson's role as a butler to a stupid prince is a funny and effectively done one, and hugh laurie is at his best in this series. very good! 9/10",1
"i rented this film purely on the fact that the cover appealed to me. however as soon as the film began i had regrets. it seems they used a home video camera to shoot this film and let a young child do it. they also used inappropriate ghostly faces and shapes to try and scare people but i found myself laughing, i could have put that together myself and done a better job of it.  as for the plot i felt that it had some really good ideas but because of dodgy lines and in some cases acting they were overshadowed. it had no direction.  i didn't want to sit through it all because it caused me physical pain to watch it but i always finish what i start so i took a deep breath and let it carry on. definitely 98minutes of my life wasted.  i would save yourself the embarrassment of knowing that you have watched 'haunted boat' and find something that is more entertaining. i'm a fan of low budget horror films but this was a major disappointment i thought nothing could get worse after 'terror toons' but this made me reconsider. a let down to its genre.  * out of ***** (the star is for the ideas of having their worst fears coming for them)",0
"brown of harvard is a hard movie to pin down. we expect a lot more from our movies these days, so it helps to remember that audiences in the 20's were a bit more innocent. william haines is charming as the rogue who has to stumble through pain and humiliation to find success and, even, glory. all of the relationships in the movie feel very stilted except for the homoerotic tie between billy and jack pickford, the town nerd. the movie has everything, romance, tears, love, death, and even sports... it's a great education in how society has changed in the 20th century.",1
"i picked this film up at my local library. having met the director at a film festival late last year, i was curious to ""check out"" his work. i was pleasantly surprised.  the film takes a fresh look at familiar subjects, love, infidelity, friendships, jealousy. it can be a bit 'talky' at times but never so much as to completely sink the film. i enjoyed watching a love story with characters that clearly belong together and watching them make conscious decisions rather than haphazardly ""falling"" into something as important as love.  the contrast between this film and the average low-budget shoot-em' up black film is quite distinct. check it out. if you're lucky, your copy will come with a copy of the soundtrack like mine did. good stuff!",1
"the legend of bloody jack is set in the alaskan wilderness & starts as a relative of some murderous deceased occultist lumberjack reads incantations (the evil dead (1982) style) from an ancient spell book in an attempt to resurrect him, he succeeds & not being a big believer in family unity the lumberjack dude kills his relative. two days later & ray (travis quentin young) along with his sister dawn (erica hoag), her boyfriend nick (craig bonacorsi) & four of their friends pull up outside a cosy log cabin (the evil dead style...) with a view to a relaxing weekend in the wilderness. unfortuntaely the killer lumberjack dude show's up with his axe & starts to slaughter the friends one-by-one...  edited, written, executive produced & directed by todd portugal this is a pretty rotten modern slasher flick the likes of which are killing the horror genre for me, i'm just not a big fan of ultra low budget horror films with the production values of a holiday video. the script is absolutely terrible in every way for 80 minutes, it has every bad slasher cliché, the character's are awful, the dialogue is terrible & it's hard to care about anyone or anything in this pretty worthless excuse for a teen slasher film. the teens are even more annoying & stupid than usual, the script is more moronic, predictable & flawed than usual & the killer lumberjack dude is just lame. then there's the final 10 minutes or so which, if you make it that far & believe it's tough going, produces one of the worst twist ending in slasher film history which as far as i'm concerned pokes fun at us the paying audience who has just had to sit through 90 minutes worth of crap. i will now spoil the ending so anyone who doesn't want to know it stop reading now. basically just before the end of the film it cuts back to ray telling a story & it turns out he was telling the story of what we had just seen & nick & dawn & everyone else berates him for telling such a bad story (i felt their pain) & then proceed to pick holes in it & laugh at it. from saying why did they stand around & argue, why didn't they pick the axe up & such things, i felt like this was poking fun at the audience as those were the sorts of things i was asking myself while watching this crap & to have it shoved down my throat & made perfectly clear that the makers knew the script was crap & could see all the holes in it & went for a twist ending which unashamedly rubbishes the preceding 80 minutes (which we have just had to sit through remember) is just a little grating. then to add insult to injury the lumberjack dude turns up & kills everyone within two minutes, why didn't he do that to start with? it would have saved everyone a lot of time.  director portugal turns in a real mess, this has the worst continuity between night & day in a film i have ever seen. the whole film is meant to set at night & i suspect the makers tried to use the day for night process but it didn't work & most of it looks like it is set during the day. for example, look at when lisa is trapped in the bathroom & she climbs out of the window. it is clearly pitch black outside when we are looking out from inside the bathroom but when she falls to the ground & the films cuts to an exterior shot it's bright daylight. then there's the fact ranger vince says we can't get a search party out here until 'the morning' indicating it was supposed to be night, then several minutes later when he walks outside & it looks like it's the middle of the day he is actually carrying around a torch which is clearly on & he is clearly pointing it in the directions where he is looking like it's night. anytime there is a scene set in the cabin look at the windows, it's pitch black outside & when the ranger walks in through the door to start with is also another clear example. the continuity in this film is simply the worst i have ever seen. there isn't much gore, there are a few scenes of an axe going into people bodies but nothing memorable. it's not scary, there's no tension or atmosphere & the appalling day & night continuity is just so distracting because it's so obvious.  technically the film is rock bottom, again the continuity between night & day has to been seen to be believed how bad it is. the special effects are poor & they couldn't even afford to show a car blowing up even though it's pretty vital to the plot. this has amateur hour written all over it from start to finish. the acting is absolutely brilliant & everyone involved should get an oscar, nah only joking, not really they were utterly awful & even the girls who got their breasts out weren't very good looking.  the legend of bloody jack is just an awful teen slasher flick, it looks like it was shot on a camcorder without the use of a tripod or steadycam, it has awful effects, is boring & has a twist ending which is either the most insulting in horror film history or i've got it totally wrong & it's the most clever. not recommended, watch a decent slasher from the 70's or 80's to remind you how they should be done.",0
"""the leap years"" is a movie adapted from an e-novella by singapore writer catherine lim, which became the first singapore novel/novella to be sold over the internet. the film had a tortuous post-production schedule: shot in early 2005, it was slated for release at the end of 2005, but only turn up eventually 3 years later, on the 29th february 2008, a leap year.  before i say anything, i must first admit i'm no fan of the romance genre, so i may be a little biased against this film - i watched it merely because it was a singapore production, and that it's available for borrowing at my neighborhood library. here's my two cents on the movie.  let's just start by saying that other than qi yu-wu's ks and wong li-lin, everybody here of note seems to be a eurasian. the love interest is a eurasian (ananda everingham), and wong's trio of buddies are all, er-hem, eurasians. does this film perpetuate the stereotype that falling in love and associating with eurasians are more ""in"" than the common chinese (or whatever asian race you are?) i don't know, it sure seems that way. also, everyone in the movie speaks in some mystical ""anglified"" accent which doesn't exist anywhere, certainly not in singapore. it's the kind of ""semi-perfect english"" that authorities would like us speak, but which doesn't exist anywhere outside, say, the mtv channel. the effect is that the dialog of the movie sounds forced and stilted, not helped by the lack of true-blue singaporeans in the cast.  the scriptwriter seems to be trying too hard to string one-liners after one-liners. after twenty minutes, the ""wit"" of the movie starts to pall and the film starts serving up its usual plate of clichés.   i guess i didn't enjoy the movie because the entire premise of sustaining a love affair over 16 long years seems unbelievable.   there are other incredulities in the film. i can't for one believe that ks (played by qi yu-wu) would fall for one of wong's girlfriends. and the scene where the bridegroom says, ""go, before i change my mind,"" has been used in a hundred east asian (korean, chinese, hong kong, taiwanese etc) tv serials...  so 4 stars for this film. the production value is fair, and wong li-lin tries her best, but she's not helped by the script. joan chen has a 15-minute bit-part in the movie as the older wong and is perhaps the best actress of the lot, but, hey, her role is just cameo.  if you come across ""the leap years"" in the rental or library, you may want to pop it in the dvd player for curiosity's sake, but otherwise, for people who don't exactly enjoy the romance genre, you can decide whether or not to give it a miss.",0
"five across the eyes ain't worth one off the wrist, i must admit at one point i was really worried, for about 30 seconds nobody made a noise and i thought my speakers had blown or that i had gone deaf with the constant screaming and high pitch yelling, me and the speakers are ok now thanks for asking, funnily enough that was the best bit of the film.  i won't waste your time telling you the plot, read the other comments for that.  if you have bought this dvd but not yet unwrapped it don't, take it back and demand your money back, i've wasted mine don't do the same.  i was actually shouting at the telly "" they're over here in the car, look for the camera lights, and get the camera man first "", i have left the swear words out but you can guess where they go.  if anybody would like to buy this film (it's really good) it's yours for a ten quid.",0
"i've been using imdb for a few years now, but have never written any reviews before. however, this movie so disappointed me (even with a modest score of 6.4 at the time of writing) that i couldn't keep quiet anymore.  noise is the story of a new yorker (tim robbins)who is so perturbed by noise pollution that he takes on an alter-ego as a as a vigilante, ""the rectifier"", and vandalizes any cars he finds with a car-alarm sounding.  i take the name of the movie to be somewhat of a misnomer. although there are one or two instances of other sources of noise being addressed or mentioned, the only true focus of our protagonist is car alarms. car alarms, car alarms, car alarms. there is really no other focus. when the movie tries to tie other examples of noise pollution to the problem of car alarms, it seems to be just thrown in to give merit to the actions of robbins' character.   yes, we're all annoyed by noise. nobody likes the sound of car alarms. of course we all have that internal urge to take a baseball bat to a shrieking vehicle, and this movie uses that fact, and pretty much that fact alone, to sell this movie. i say 'pretty much' because there is also a blatantly contrived sexual relationship (including a completely needless threesome) which is obviously thrown in for those movie-goers who need such things thrown in in order to enjoy a movie. honestly, it's eye-rolling.  robbin's character, very shortly into the movie, becomes completely unrelatable. it seems less that he decides not to put up with the noise anymore, and more that by focusing so much on the noise he has begun to lose his sanity. the first half of the movie is essentially the story of how he turns from just an angry, car-bashing dude into this hero of the little guy, the rectifier. however... the transformation doesn't take place. he just renames himself.  i could go on for a while. annoying generalized social commentary comes in every now and then to add to the pretentiousness of the movie, and the self-satisfied smirk which never quite leaves robbins face doesn't help either.   overall, i think it's very obvious what this movie is trying to be, as it's pretty much shoved down your throat, but in my opinion, it fails in a big way. just one guy's opinion, cheers.",0
"even though the book wasn't strictly accurate to the real situation it described it still carried a sense of japan. i find it hard to believe that anyone who was involved in making this film had ever been to japan as it didn't feel japanese in the slightest. almost everything about it was terrible. i will admit the actors were generally quite good but couldn't stand a chance of saving it. before the film started i was surprised that there were only ten people in the cinema on a friday night shortly after the movie had opened in japan. 30 minutes in i was amazed they stayed. i stayed so i would have the right to criticize it. the whole movie was punctuated my groans and suppressed laughs of disbelief from my japanese girlfriend. everyone i saw walking out of that cinema had looks of confusion and disappointment on their faces.   to the makers of this movie, you owe me two hours.",0
"from it's uninspiring title to the flat acting performances, curdled is very much an unremarkable film throughout. the film has gained some fans by way of the fact that quentin tarantino's name is attached to it, and the silly and out of place nod to the rodriguez/tarantino flick 'from dusk till dawn'. these things do not make a great movie, however, and this is more than evident all the way through 'curdled'. the film suffers from an all too obvious lack of ideas, and it tries to mask this with murders that are meant to be stylish and events that are supposed to be disturbing. the mexican music score that accompanies many of the sequences in the film is obviously meant to be cool, but it's becomes annoying very quickly; especially as aside from the fact that the lead character is mexican, it doesn't fit with the tone of the movie. the film's plot is typically offbeat and it follows a gorehound who, because of her obsession with grisly murders, takes a job with a firm that cleans up murder scenes. it sounds boring and it is.  william baldwin is the only 'name' on the cast list, and even he doesn't make an impression. he hasn't been given anything to do in the movie and aside from talking to his victims and standing around trying to look menacing, he's pretty much wasted. angela jones, or rather; the taxi driver from pulp fiction, takes the lead role as the murder obsessed young woman, and it is always clear that it's her involvement with pulp fiction that won her this role, not her acting ability. she may have been good enough in her small role in tarantino's masterpiece, but she doesn't have the talent to lead a film by herself. she looks lost and out of place for the majority of the film, and if it weren't for her latino accent; she wouldn't convince the audience that she's a weirdo on any level. curdled is a one hundred percent-proof piece of forgettable trash. films like this often win themselves praise for invention or black comedic antics; but this one fails on all levels. whether you're a tarantino fan, william baldwin fan, horror fan or just a movie buff; this is one to miss.",0
"**** = a masterpiece to be recorded in the books and never forgotten  ***1/2 = a classic in time; simply a must see  *** = a solid, worth-while, very entertaining piece  **1/2 = a good movie, but there are some uneven elements or noticeable flaws  ** = may still be considered good in areas, but this work has either serious issues or is restrained by inevitable elements deemed inescapable (e.g., genre)  *1/2 = mostly a heap of nothing sparked by mildly worthwhile moments  bomb = not of a viewable quality  - kalifornia = ***  - unrated (for strong violent material, considerable sexuality, and language)  i rented this film expecting an in-your-face summer-blockbuster-quality celebration of brad pitt's face, but was happily surprised and disappointed. this really is more of a drama, and very grim at that... i remember some emotionally intense duchovny voice-overs.  pitt plays out his possibly un-sexiest film ever with startling talent. who started out as a hopeless yet harmless ""white trash"" husband became realized as a violent, disturbing alcoholic with a messed mind. during some of the latter stages in the film, i found it hard to keep watching him - he was unpredictable and scary. this proves very good writing and acting.  the whole movie is filled with bizarre, sensational scenes that made me hold my breath not fewer than once, and i don't mean action scenes. i mean dialogue scenes so brilliantly crafted i actually winced and gasped at what i was seeing. it was like watching a rhino and a lion put in a cage and watching as they gnawed each other to death. again, i am very impressed with the screenwriter(s); whoever they are did the impossible: mixed oil and water.  i also very much enjoyed juliette lewis's performance. it is so rare for this talented young actress to make an appearance these days that when she does it is such a joy. some of her moments in this film brought me to tears. i mean that. the emotions this girl can arouse in your head are incredible, and i clearly remember getting blurry-eyed on a few occasions.  i almost feel like i'm cheating the quality craftsmanship the film makers have displayed by only giving ""kalifornia"" a *** rating. but the dark feelings that it stirs are too potent and depressing to raise it. i do believe that everyone should see this movie though. i truly do.",1
"since this picture is classified a ""pure entertainment"" work and since there are already many comments on it, i'd like hereby to address something relevant to the abuse of humour. we can see that marlon wayans is playing the joker role in this film. certainly as long as he has been involved in the casting job, he has always been acting as a little man-an actor can change his customary dress but can hardly change his physical appearance-and the latter one can be an advantage when necessary. however far away from what i expected, i saw an image very disguising, pretending to expose different aspects of the baby life by mistake of a forty-year- old criminal. and with a ridiculous happy ending. so what is the point? many elements are mixed up, some principal ones are violence, sex and criminal activities, amongst which the story is badly composed and to some extent, lack common sense: where is vanessa when the peace of her house is violated and her husband's life being pursued? in addition the diamond is even bigger than the world's no.1 cullinan! but the most sickening facet is the continuous attempt to make up the little man as a superman by showing his physical weak points. and they call it humour. a diamond is precious, hard and fragile; it cannot be cut by any other material but only be conquered by the hot blood of a male goat. hence it's no more a diamond but pieces of debris.",0
"i love the doodlebops. my son has been watching them for over a year. we went to the doodlebops concert last year as well as one concert yesterday (connecticut). he loves them. the doodlebops do not teach the alphabet or numbers but who cares? are you being serious? the tv isn't suppose to teach your children about numbers or the alphabet. the parents should. get over it. the doodlebops actually can sing. deedee has a beautiful voice and in concert you can tell all 3 of them have nice singing voices and do not lip sing. imagine, they dance, jump around and still sing. they have talent, the kids love them i even enjoy watching the show. this show is by far the best show on tv for kids. and a rock band for children. how amazing is that? why are people saying chad (rooney) is gay? where did you hear that from? whether he is or not, he is awesome! leave him alone. its not like he or anyone else is promoting homosexuality to our children!",1

"i love claire danes, and kate beckinsale looks amazingly immature in her role. the movie is flawed only because it seems the two accused seem to be in some monastery, working like monks in the grass and under strict almost martial-arts-like discipline. the acting and filmography and amazing colors of what is supposed-to-be thailand is eye-catching, but claire daines steals the entire movie, and is unexpectedly profound in her learning the hard lesson of life itself to the very end, in an act of amazing unselfishness unheard of and completely unexpected in the real world. the flaws are minute and i recommend the film, which seems buried sadly forever to rare tv showings. i for one want the film for my collection- a collection of only ""10"" rated films. watch it, you will be very touched.",1
"the movie is very realistic. absolutely, it does not belong to the hollywood cinema genre where every line must be pronounced in a perfect manner and where every move is precise. the actors playing the roles of the lovers do a great job representing the characters' feelings and thoughts - their everyday life adventures. overall, the movie climaxes the viewer to a depressed state. this is where the realism of the whole story is apparent. not everything happens the way we think it should happen. i can say though that the movie does not end on a bad note. we watch, we learn, we experience ourselves. that is probably the moral of this story.",1

"victor mclaglen's performance is one of the finest in film history.  i think we can all feel for ""gypo"" because we've all struggled with what is right and what isn't and been wrong. this was one of the first art-house pictures to be released by a major american movie studio (rko radio pictures).  joseph h. august's cinematography is at its very best here. however, august's stunning portion was mostly overlooked; he didn't receive the oscar nomination he rightly deserved.  this is a psychological drama, with thought, philosophy, sadness, all conveyed with as little words as possible.",1
"this is your only spoiler warning. what a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered ""oscar worthy"".  i divide material into three levels. the first is the stage theatre. here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and, most importantly, in the power of the writer. a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better. the best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show.  the second level is film. in this medium, a weaker writer can be used, but the viewer is not sitting in one spot the entire time. with film, the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing. furthermore, film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal.  the final level is literature. in this context, everything is imagined by the author, translated onto paper, and then re-imagined by the reader. far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio.  this is why adaptations can go up, but never down. novelizations are never better than the base film (see the dime-per-dozen ones at your local book store), whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book (catch-22 and lotr). movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies.  as for 'the last picture show', it fails. it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right. the characters talk the same and act the same, it's pure futility. add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film.  i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians. the instructor raved about how sad the movie was. what is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious. had this been in color the scenes of impotence, the pool party, and the old hooker would be considered great comedy. look what lucas did with 'american graffiti' a few years later.  the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film. two visually powerful downbeat films: apocalypse now and barry lyndon. rely on them, not this. it's the 'last' i want to see of it. 1 out of 5.",0
"i'm an incorrigible skeptic and agnostic and was thus expecting to enjoy this film. after watching it, however, i honestly believe that i could have made a better documentary myself. its arguments appear to have only four spurious sources (despite his being listed in the credits on imdb i didn't see richard dawkins anywhere), it's edited together crudely with laughably amateurish computer effects, and it doesn't make even the slightest attempt to appear impartial. the narration is pervaded throughout with a sneering, almost adolescent anti-christian sentiment, ruining any possibility that the film might actually change someone's mind as opposed to just preaching to the choir (i.e. me). though there is some interesting discussion of the historicity of jesus, the movie hits an unbearable snag when it begins to dwell heavily on the christian school which the director attended as a child, an institution which apparently scarred him badly psychologically as it obsesses him to this day.  though tgwwt obviously had a low budget, there was still an opportunity here to make an intelligent commentary on the highly questionable roots of christianity. there's certainly a dearth of skeptically-minded religious documentaries on the market, and this film could have helped fill the void. instead, the director chose to insult our intelligence with this piece of garbage, which in the end appears to be some sort of therapeutic exercise for him. it's too bad that his christian upbringing traumatized him, but he needn't subject an audience to his coping mechanism.",0
"i didn't have huge expectations for this film when renting it for $1 at the video store, but the box at least showed a little promise with its ""killer cut"" of ""more gore! more sex!"" can't go wrong there! well... needless to say, the box is a fraud. how in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this low?  it all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend (?) as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her. then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another. they slit her wrists for no real reason and you can see when they ""cut"" her that someone drew the cuts with what looks like a crayon.  from there, repeat the same theme of the girl getting chased/killed unbrutally by two guys for about 84 more minutes. add in one tit shot. that is soul survivors.  i wouldn't have had a problem with this film had the box not frauded me into renting the flick. if i rent a bad film that claims to have more violence and sex.... i want more violence and sex! one full frontal shot in 85 minutes from a chick who is clearly androginous and gore that would not scare a child does not cut it. if this is the killer cut, what is the theatrical cut?! of course, i doubt this garbage was actually put into theaters in the first place. shame on the actors in this film. i could see them making their screen debuts in here because they have not done anything before, but they were all established before this was released. i don't know if it was filmed before they had all been established and the studio sat on the film until they were semi-big names or not. but what i want to know is.... they really spent $14 million on this film?!",0
"i have never seen such a movie before. i was on the edge of my seat and constantly laughing throughout the entire movie. i never thought such horrible acting existed it was all just too funny. the story behind the movie is decent but the movies scenes fail to portray them. i have never seen such a stupid movie in my life which is why it i think its worth watching. i give this movie 10 out of 10 for being the most pathetic movie ever created, this movie seems like it was solely created to become trash. i mean the scenes seem so fake and the actors act like ""the camera is in front of them"". you will get a kick just watching how lame this movie is, me and my friend could not stop making jokes during the movie, the darthvader guy who tries to get the girl got ran over not once but twice and the second time he got ran over it sounded like he said sh!# although he doesn't speak english lol. if you watch this movie you will think to yourself that all those other movies you didn't like you took for granted they are way better than this. this movie should be seen out of curiosity as well as what kind of movie defines lame. the evil serpent encountered the girl so many times it was ridiculous, the evil serpent just roared and roared and let her get away every time. the evil serpent had so many chances it was like god was trying to say hurry up and eat the girl how many miracles do you want. the transition between scenes leaves you wondering did i miss something? so many plot holes from scene to scene. i was laughing like crazy when they decided to ""escape to mexico"" to get away from the serpent. hmmmm hopping the border will save you from a serpent from korea? interesting... very interesting.... i guess hopping the border solves all problems. another scene that completely stupified me.. they met for the first time and had a romantic scene at the beach they kissed and didn't even know each other... the scene was so clichéd and the was no substance at least in other movies it might seem logical afterwhile but i mean they just met even though they are reincarnations there feelings were like they instantly loved each other instead of it rather developing. anyways this movie is worth watching for the sake of opening your eyes and seeing the light. bad hollywood movies will seem like heaven when compared to this. in the end its worth watching you wont get bored you will be occupied criticizing every moment, every scene in your head.",1
"this was a better than average movie i thought, for it being on cable. i had expected something along the lines of cheesy melodrama and bad special effects seen in such classics as christmas rush or first daughter/target/shot, etc.  the cast was well chosen...i especially liked ron livingston as the hard pressed swat commander. it's good to see him revisiting the same material he had so much fortune with in band of brothers. the producers and designers had done their homework because all the scenes and shots looked like they did on that day back in 1997.  so, if you get a chance to see this film, and i am sure you will since fx reruns everything 50 times...take 2 hours and enjoy it.",0
"after watching this movie on dvd, i watched the trailer. the voice-over describes the movie as surreal. well, there's surreal, and there's surreal.   there was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me, but frankly, it was more confusing than surreal. the other unusual imagery, particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor, were so nonsensical they had no meaning. i don't mind imagery that doesn't mean anything, but these scenes just seemed irrelevant.  my impression is that the director was trying to convey logan's inner monologue. i don't know what else would explain what was going on. unfortunately, nothing i saw gave me any clue what logan was thinking about, what his perspective was, or even his emotional state. all i could tell was that he wasn't particularly happy with his physical appearance, and that he had a crush on an older boy.   i thought the ending signaled what the relationship between the boys had become, but not much else did. purposely juxtaposing ambiguous scenes with those that were more straightforward seemed more like a cop out than an artistic decision.   still, as tiresome and as content-free the movie was for me, it was a definite change of pace. i very much liked madagascar skin, and i had the feeling this movie aspired to that kind of narrative, and perhaps even style. it didn't even come close. for me there's no question about it: this movie deserves an a for effort, but a d for execution.",0

"elvira, mistress of the dark, is a fun, camp horror comedy, in which the fourth wall is broken a couple of times and the jokes often stay below the navel. and the breasts of cassandra peterson become a character of their own.  elvira (cassandra peterson) is stacked horror show hostess, who learns, that she has inherited her aunt morgana. so she goes to a little town of fallwell, which is ruled by the most horrendous monster ever to embrace the earth: morality comity. elviras boobacious appearance is, of course, too much for the prunes, but the kids of the town get a kick out of her different kind of approach on life. and of course there is even more sinister evil, her uncle vincent (william morgan sheppard), who is after elvira's mothers book of spells. see, elvira actually is a real witch, she just doesn't know it. yet.  for what it is, elvira is quite funny film, even though the script does leave a lot of room for improvement. most laughs come from the difference between elvira and the people of good morals, but there are a couple of good visual gags as well. over all direction is okay, but it never rises to be anything more than that. in all, a good, intentionally campy, comedy. if you like this kind of thing, that is.",1

"this academy award winning short film can rank among the greatest of the genre. told completely without dialogue, it is a visual treat about a young boy who buys a gold fish, lovingly places him in a bowl then goes off to school, leaving the gold fish unprotected and a window carelessly open. after a while, a neighboring orange tabby comes poking around, comes in through the window and heads slowly for the bowl. the fish apparently knows something is going on and becomes very excited. as the cat comes very near to the bowl, the fish jumps out. the cat catches the fish, drops him back in the bowl and exits through the window he came in just as the boy, not knowing what has happened, gets back. this was amazingly filmed with real animals; how cousteau got these animals to behave in this manner is remarkable. i only wish this film were available now for people to see; i only saw it once, in 1959 when it was originally released, but it has remained unforgettable.",1
"in the opening scene, the eye patch wearing desperado named hawkeye has a smooth forehead, but when he follows johnny into the pueblo, he's shown with a scar over his patched eye. that's just one of the many continuity lapses in this edgy 'spaghetti' western, but rather than detract from the picture, it adds a special flavor to the proceedings.  another occurs when sanchez turns in his three dead bodies, they have to be examined for their identities - ""you just can't imagine how many false cadavers we have in our town"". immediately after, carradine (lawrence dobkin) shows up to collect his bounty with no more than a wanted poster in hand.  as for the film's principal johnny yuma (mark damon), he's shown with his holster alternately on his right and left hip throughout the movie after exchanging gun belts with carradine following the barroom brawl. johnny's bound for san margo at his uncle's request, but will have to avenge his death at the hands of deceitful wife samantha (rosalba neri) and her conniving brother pedro (louis vanner). it takes some time getting there, but it's a fun ride with one of the best music scores on record. as for that saloon fight, i got a kick out of the kung fu sound effects every time a punch connected.  care for some more story exaggerations? following the duel with pedro the first time, johnny wipes a small amount of blood from his lip which he manages to smear pedro's entire face with. similarly, when pedro smacks around little pepe later in the film he doesn't cut him, but by the time johnny arrives, pepe's face is covered with blood.  ""johnny yuma"" is probably one of the best of the genre that doesn't have clint eastwood in it. as johnny, mark damon is a reasonably suitable stand in but without the seething exterior. carradine seemed to be a replacement for the obligatory lee van cleef character, without being a total bad guy. at first the identity exchange between carradine and johnny didn't seem to make sense, but it all tied together by the time the film ended. you knew each henchman would wind up getting his due; marking time for each was part of the anticipation.  in case you're wondering, the title hero has nothing to do with the nick adams character from the classic tv western ""the rebel"". in this film, johnny got his name from a gunfight he had in yuma once.  perhaps the most unique element of the story had to do with the way it tied things up with the evil samantha who pulled the strings behind the scenes throughout. after shooting carradine she beats a hasty retreat before johnny can get his revenge. still alive, it looks like carradine tries to shoot her and misses, but it doesn't take long for johnny and sanchez to track her into the dessert where she perished without water - carradine aimed for her canteen.",1
"""the bat people"" is a proud resident of the imdb bottom 100. every once and a while the movie suddenly vanishes from the infamous list, depending on whether there are new movies with paris hilton in the lead or documentaries about american idol stars, but it always reliably returns sooner or later. and why? because, unlike the majority of crap in that list, ""the bat people"" is a legitimate bad film and it deserves to be on there regardless of any media influences or internet buzz! this nearly isn't the worst film ever made, since the basic concept definitely has a certain charm and ingenuity, but it's still indescribably difficult to sit through the whole thing. the script is incredibly boring, with absolutely unnecessary padding footage and gigantic gaps in continuity, and yet the main characters still remain total strangers throughout the entire film. other than a sensible screenplay, the film also lacks spectacular killing sequences and the make-up effects  although courtesy of a young stan winston  are ludicrously inept and remain largely unseen until the end of the film. the film's title is inaccurate, as ""people"" refers to a number in plural whereas the story actually just revolves on one bat person. much more than bruce wayne, the real batman plays in this movie and he as well has a genuine bat-cave and a bat-mobile (a stolen ambulance)! the plot introduces a young couple on their honeymoon-weekend exploring caves. they wander off from a guided tour group and he gets bitten by a bat whilst trying to protect his wife from the animal's vicious attack. worried that he might be infected with rabies, he undergoes an intense treatment at the local hospital, but still this doesn't prevent him from slowly transforming into a bloodthirsty bat creature. he kills random people at night and toys around with the suspicious police sergeant whilst his loving wife is still vastly convinced the awkward behavior is exclusively due to allergic reactions to the rabies treatment. sure, honey! the script never explains why a bat would attack people and how come john always changes back into a normal human being at the dawn of a new day instead of gradually turning into a permanent state of bat-guano. so basically, ""the bat people"" is a variation on the good old werewolf-theme, but obviously not a very interesting one. the concept showed a lot of potential, but somehow the sub plots center on whiny drunks and perverted sheriffs instead of on ghastly monsters. some of the settings and exterior filming locations look impressive, the misfit song playing during the credits is strangely catchy, there's a nice bit of gore during the climax (finally!) and main actress marianne mcandrew is ravishing to look at (though not to listen to). this truly bad and boring film's current listing in the bottom 100 is spot number 80, and personally i hope it sticks somewhere in that region. the list simply wouldn't feel and traditional without ""the bat people"".",0

"it sounds as if it should be a biography of claude monet but it's actually a highly focused story of relationships between three adolescent girls on a french synchronized swimming team. there are no parents or teachers to speak of, no school, and boys are represented by one peripheral figure, the hunky francois who enters the story determined from time to time and always leaves confused.  pauline aquart is the youngest of the three, only aspiring to join the team she so much admires. she's kind of odd looking. she's not yet out of her adolescent growth spurt and has long, bony limbs, big feet, and no derriere to speak of. she's prognathous and sports these plump pursed lips. after a while her appearance grows on you and from certain angles she can come to appear enthralling.  adele haenel is older -- more, well, more developed physically. what a glamorous figure she cuts in her swim suit, sauntering around, teasing the boys, swishing her long blond hair. but she's not what she seems. or is she? i couldn't quite figure it out. the french are long on paradoxes and short on consistency. no wonder francois is always sniffing after her.  there's not so much ambiguity in louse blachere's character. she's on the team too but she's dumpy and plain, and sensitive about it, and has an intense crush on francois. blachere is a good actress and adds to the ungainliness of the character through her performance.  the movie deals with the relationships between these three, meaning intrigues, deceptions, hidden feelings, and all the rest of what we associate with young girls who spend much time with one another. this is of course a tricky topic. it becomes trickier during the gradual development of a homoerotic relationship between pauline and adele. not that you should expect this to be a soft porn movie. the only nudity we see is considerably less than a turn on, and what little sex there is under the covers, sometimes literally.  i don't think i want to get into the plot or into its analysis too much, partly because it's suggestive rather than expressed through action, partly because it's complex, and partly because i'm not sure i got it all.  let me give an example. okay. adele is the girl the others envy. she's also quite distant and self satisfied. on top of that she is apparently schtupping every boy and man in sight if they can be of any use to her at all, from the handsome but dumb francois to the bus driver she wants a favor from. she brags unashamedly about her expertise in fellatio. when pauline approaches her about joining the swim team, adele uses her as a lookout during assignations with the guys. a superior and self-indulgent narcissist, you know? but then the soi-disant slut takes the skinny pauline under her wing and reveals to pauline that she's still a virgin. really? yes, really. pauline begins to draw closer to adele and adele finally confesses that she'd like to rid herself of her hymen and she would like pauline to do it for her. pauline, now drawn sexually to adele, performs the task with subdued relish. now adele would really like to get it on with a man, preferably older and experienced. so she takes pauline to a boite where she dances seductively with some guy until she follows pauline to the powder room. the two girls stand there staring at one another, neither having overtly expressed a sexually tinged interest in the other. but adele stands so close that pauline slowly loosens her own reins, reaches up, and kisses adele on the lips. adele steps back, smiling, and says, ""there now, that wasn't so bad, was it?"", and then walks back into the club.  that's a pretty close description of whatever is going on between pauline and adele -- but what the hell is going on? initially, adele treats pauline like an irrelevant child, later like a close friend, finally like a potential lover -- and the minute pauline responds, adele walks off satisfied. is she using pauline the way she seems to be using men? does it satisfy adele to know that she now has another person in involuntary servitude? i don't know.  i've slighted louise blachere as the third member of the trio, the plain and overripe wallflower whose expression always suggests dumbfoundedness but who at least is thoroughly heterosexual and the first of the three to rid herself of that noisome virginity, but i've only skipped her for considerations of space.  should you see it? by all means. (just compare it to the typical american movie about high school kids.) for men, some of whom have never penetrated the female mystique, this may give you some idea of what it looks like in medium shot.",1
"michael rooker is a decent actor, but he has no business being the lead except in a low budget movie. he really does not have much charisma. ryo ishibashi has a lot more screen presence, and sadly he is not really the main character. most of the screen time goes to the brick-faced rooker.  danielle harris (from the halloween 4 and 5 movies) plays his daughter, and she is cute and entertaining but she is written as not being too smart and one of her dumb mistakes gets one of the main characters killed. comedians fred willard, bobcat goldthwait, and stephen furst are here in interesting roles. just watching what happens to these characters is priceless.   vincent schiavelli plays the consigliare to the local mafia godfather, and it is hard to tell whether or not he is working the movie as a comedy. tim thomerson is also in this movie. he seems to be in every extremely low budget direct-to-video action movie. thomerson is also in some low-budget comedies. seeing so many comedians and comic actors in this film made it feel like a spoof. is it a parody of a yakuza movie? it is hard to tell at some points. there is certainly very little yakuza action.   the supporting cast of thugs and goons is menacing and well cast. some of these kinds of movies have thugs that look like they work at the local comic book store or as stock boys at piggly-wiggly. overall this movie is very uneven. at some points it seems like a comedy or a parody. then at other points it works as a good action movie. then it sputters to an end. without the contributions of danielle harris and ryo ishibashi this movie would rate a zero in my humble opinion.",0
"i rented the dubbed-english version of lensman, hoping that since it came from well-known novels it would have some substance. while there were hints of substance in the movie, it mostly didn't rise above the level of kiddie cartoon. maybe the movie was a bad adaptation of the book, or it lost a lot in the dubbed version. or maybe even the source novels were lightweight. but for whatever reason, there wasn't much there.  i noticed lots of details that were derivative, sloppy, poorly dramatized, or otherwise deficient. some examples: the opening scenes looked borrowed from the 2001 ""star gate"" scene and the star wars image of hyperspace. the robot on the harvester looked like an anthropomorphized ""r2-d2"".  it starts out trying to borrow its comic relief style of star wars, but mercifully (since the humor doesn't work) gives up on comedy and plays it serious. in that sense, it's superior to the star wars franchise, which started with a clever sense of humor, and eventually deteriorated to jar-jar's annoying silliness.  the agricultural details were apparently drawn by someone who had never seen a farm. the harvester was driving through the unharvested middle of a field, dumping silage onto unharvested crops, rather than working from one side to the other and dumping the silage onto already-harvested rows or into a truck. corn (maize) was pouring out the grain chute, but the farm lands were drawn like a wheat field.  when it was time for kim's father had to face his fate, there wasn't any dramatic weight to the scene. that could have been partly the fault of the english-language voice actor, but the drawings didn't show much weight either. kim's reactions in that scene were similarly unconvincing.  similarly, when a character named henderson was killed, chris showed very little reaction, even though they were apparently supposed to have been close. (henderson's death is no spoiler; his name isn't revealed until his death scene.) she seems to promptly forget him. someone's expression of sympathy shows more feeling than she does. i think the voice actor deserves most of the blame in that case; there's at least a hint of feeling in the drawings of chris.  on several occasions, villains fail to accomplish their orders. a villain leader often punishes those failures with miserable deaths. i can't say whether that's lifted from star wars, or if that comes from an earlier source -- possibly the lensman books.  there's a scene where a space ship crash-lands. as it plunges toward the ground, parts are break off the ship. but so many pieces are fall off that there should be nothing left of it by the time it lands.  while in most cases chris seems like a competent, tough space hero, there's a scene where she shrieks like an incompetent damsel in distress. someone tough enough to get over henderson's death so quickly should at least be able to shout, ""help, it's got me and i can't reach my gun!"" instead of just shrieking.  the character with the most personality (almost too much at times) is d.j. bill. he sounded like wolfman jack, the d.j. in american graffiti. i wonder if he's as well-voiced in the original language.  two planets in the movie exploded. the explosions were unimpressive, and appeared to owe a lot of inspiration to star wars. to its credit, however, the cause of the explosion was completely unlike the death star's primary weapon. the dialog had a good, interesting explanation for the cause. many other explosions in the movie did look good, just not the planetary explosions.  some of the sound effects are very cheesy, as if borrowed from a late 1970s video game. some of the images look like primitive video games, and some influence from tron is visible too. on the other hand, the sound effects are often pretty decent, although that emphasizes the cheesy-sounding parts. the art is good too, particularly when it stays away from the often cheesy-looking computer graphics.  finally, there's the story. if a movie tells a good story, it can get away with a lot of production shortcomings. but the plot here was pretty lightweight. a naïve boy tries to help someone on a crippled space ship, and acquires a great power he doesn't understand. he and his band of very virtuous companions struggle against a powerful, unredeemably evil enemy. he makes friends, learns about his special power, and grows into a young man. if he is persistent and virtuous enough, he might even defeat the evil enemy. details along the way can make such a story rise above the simple outline, but there's very little more than that in this movie.  in the end, it's just a kiddie cartoon. but then, since it looks like the primary intended audience is older children, maybe it doesn't need to be anything more than that.",0
"i was drawn to this movie the moment i saw a preview of it on oscar night. when i read about kay pollak, i was hooked. we americans are suckers for a comeback kid.  i understand this movie was a huge draw in sweden. as a very provincial american i can only speculate on the reason. perhaps it is because of the provocative joke that the lena character makes at the beginning of the movie and other social comment but perhaps it is because of the central message which i believe has the same appeal everywhere in affluent societies.  the message of this movie for me is the same as the movie titanic. life is short people and as far as anyone really knows it's all we've got. it can be taken away at any time. so isn't it a pity that we spend so much time hiding behind walls separating us from other people because we're so afraid of being hurt? tearing down the walls is painful but feeling alive lies on the other side of those wretched walls. feeling alive is worth taking the risk. give and you will receive. so start living now.  many people are criticizing this movie for it's lack of characterization and other flaws. i say you are all pseudo-sophisticated. get a grip folks, it's a parable, a fable for we affluent westerners who are materially rich but whose souls are in abject poverty.  so join a choir or a band or help build housing or distribute food for those less fortunate than you. spread some joy and make the world a better place as long as you get out and commune with your fellow man. writing a check is not enough. we are a social species by the way. even the humblest of your fellow human beings can affect you in ways you never thought possible.  rugged individualism has its place but it is over-rated.",1
"gender bender the limerick:  a man or a woman? who knows?  it turns out that 'it' is both.  sleeping in clay  then they all went away  in one of their ufos.  gender bender is another great season 1 episode. i enjoy this one because the story is the kind where you are never really sure what's gonna happen next. it is entirely original. the teaser is very fun with the close up of the eye and the reflection of the disco lights. i really need to learn my that thumb trick the genderbender heshe does. i really like the atmosphere at the kindred's little village and mulder and scully sneaking around in the middle of the night. its very exciting. this is one of my favorite season 1 episodes in fact. i think the thing i like about it so much is how they turn out to be aliens in the end and left crop circles. many people see this as a non-mythology related alien episode kind of like ""the unnatural"" or ""space"" but i think this could easily be seen as mythology related. maybe the genderbender was just like the alien bounty hunter and could appear to look like anyone. huh? anyway i give the episode a 9 out of 10.",1
"escaping the life of being pimped by her father(..and the speakeasy waitressing)who dies in an explosion, lily powers(barbara stanwyck, who is simply ravishing)sluts her way through the branches inside a bank business in big city gotham. when a possessive lover murders who was supposed to be his next father-in-law(and lily's new lover), the sky's the limit for lily as she has written down her various relationships in a diary and subtlety makes it known the papers will receive it if certain pay doesn't come into her hands. newly appointed president to the bank, courtland trenholm(george brent), sends lily to paris instead of forking over lots of dough, but soon finds himself madly in love after various encounters with her in the city of love. this makes lily's mouth water as now she'll have reached the pedestal of success seducing a man of wealth and prestige bring riches her way. though, circumstances ensue which will bring her to make a decision that threatens her successful way of achieving those riches..trenholm, now her husband, is being indicted with jail certain and has lost the bank. he needs money lily now has in her possession or he'll have absolutely nothing.  stanwyck is the whole movie despite that usual warner brothers polish. being set in the pre-code era gives the filmmakers the chance to elaborate on taboo subjects such as a woman using sex to achieve success and how that can lead to tragedy. good direction from alfred e green shows through subtlety hints in different mannerisms and speech through good acting from the seductive performance of stanwyck how to stage something without actually showing the explicit act. obviously the film shows that money isn't everything and all that jazz as love comes into the heart of lily's dead heart. that ending having lily achieve the miraculous metamorphosis into someone in love didn't ring true to me. she's spent all this time to get to that platform only to fall for a man who was essentially no different than others she had used before him.",1

"a highly atmospheric cheapie, showing great ingenuity in the use of props, sets and effects (fog, lighting, focus) to create an eerie and moody texture. the story is farfetched, the acting is merely functional, but it shows how imaginative effects can develop an entire visual narrative. this movie is recommended for its mood and texture, not for its story.",1
"for the record, i am not affiliated with the production in any way.  hidden frontier is probably the star trek fan film with the most episodes produced to date. over 7 seasons (this is the last) they have produced some 50 or so episodes.  this is no mean feat on almost no budget and everyone volunteering their time and energy.  by their own admission, the earlier seasons do not have as good production qualities as later ones but as they progress the effects, green screen work and acting all improve.  i did find it difficult to ""dip into"" so started from the beginning and watched all the way through. hf benefits from story arcs just like all the best sci fi and dovetails nicely into the star trek universe in which it is set. characters and ""relatives"" from the original series have been brought into the stories and add a lot to the feel of the stories, sometimes improving on the characters over the original.  the whole experience includes an excellent web site, blooper reels, a high membership forum which is frequented by many of the actors and production staff and a weekly chat.  if you are looking for high definition, high budget productions, this is probably not for you.  if you are looking for continued adventures in the star trek universe with stories that does star trek credit and makes you think, this is the one.",1

"when i first tuned in on this morning news, i thought, ""wow, finally, some entertainment."" it was slightly amusing for a week or so... but we have to face it, these news reporters (if one can even call them that) have way too much ""playing around"" time.  at first, i thought jillian was a breathe of fresh air. but seriously, this woman has got not the least bit of journalist in her. she is very unprofessional. she keeps on interrupting steve when he starts informing the viewers about a certain news report. it's just really become annoying to the point that i can't watch it anymore.  jillian is not a good journalist. hell, she's more of a celebrity who loves being a celebrity. hence, she instantly transforms into a celebrity around celebrities whom she's supposed to be interviewing. she's not very professional and quite possibly perceives her relationship with celebrities more important than being a rightfully insatiable journalist- and that's all i can say about her.  also (disappointingly), this show has more entertainment news than necessary news reports about the world, the government, the us, or something that will benefit and/or serve the public's best interest. they're too focus on sensationalism that everything they talk about comes off as a commercial product. on the other hand, their field reporters are interestingly tolerable...  i believe ""good day la"" is for young teenagers and celebrities, and it is definitely not for people who actually care about the news.  side note: (i'd really rather watch ktla. however, they try so hard to be entertaining sometimes. they're still a bit dull though. oh well, i'll stick to nbc's ""today."" abc's ""good morning america"" is also okay... as long as diane sawyer doesn't become way too serious.)",0

i loved this movie it was one of the years best pornos i remember watching it on starz or some god damn thing but it was great. i only saw like half of it and i taped it and all i can say is i loved every minute of what i saw. i didnt sleep for weeks after i saw this movie (although i was very tired.),1
"the most important thing about this movie is the brilliant performance by daniel day-lewis and hugh o'conor as christy brown, guineas artist and fighter who despite of her physical condition overcame all the odds. as a person who did work with patients with cerebral palsy, i can assure you that their performance were shockingly convincing. the enormous support that christy got form his family, low-income, working class dubliners, encouraged him to do the impossible and this picture depicted this support brilliantly have not read the book, but the dialogs were written wisely to capture christy brown's witty arrogant personality. i do recommend this movie to everyone, especially to classic movie-lovers.",1
"i love this anime! i was laughing my head off with all of the jokes and the violence (mostly from akane ranma's reluctant but short tempered ""fiancee"")is so slapstick however ranma does deserve it but he does try his best to make amends...clumsily. the main character ranma goes to china to train only to fall into the cursed jusenkkyo spring and turns into a girl when splashed by cold water. from then on it's pure chaos one after another. among the stand outs are the deranged brother and sister duo of kuno and kodachi, the sexy shampoo, the pervert happosai all causing trouble for our hero/heroine. however it is ranma's selfish father genma who winds up being the culprit for the mess most of the time. if anyone want an anime that's funny, this is the one. it's cuter and better with the japanese dub.",1
"after reading the book, i loved the story. watching the movie i was disappointed that so many changes were made. it is understandable that books and movies differ but it was two different stories, only the names and some of the book's story remained. read the book and you'll have a better understanding of the movie. the book gives you a better development of the characters. these characters are extremely interesting and make you care about them. the locations were indeed in line with the book's descriptions. some characters not included. television has microwaved so many great books and stories, this is a perfect example of that. input from the author doesn't always insure a good movie but it can help sometimes.",0
"legend of dragoon is one of those little-known games that people either love or hate. some people claim it's far too similar to other games, namely the final fantasy series--which is understandable, since it was originally intended to be sony's equivalent of final fantasy. honestly i can't comment on the similarities beyond that, as i'm not very familiar with the ff games.  i think my favorite aspect of the game is the battle system. not only do you have the ability to change into a more powerful dragoon form, but every time you attack, you have to pay attention in order to complete the attack by pressing buttons at the correct time. not only that, sometimes enemies will attack you back right in the middle of a sequence, which means you have to press different buttons in order to avoid taking damage. even the use of certain attack items requires a bit of button-mashing. if you don't want to attack, you can always guard, which not only cuts any damage taken in half, but raises your hit points without the use of healing potions.  the fmvs are quite well-done, about the same quality as final fantasy 8's. however, the graphics during game play aren't quite up to that standard. they're nice, but they could have been--and honestly, should have been--better. the translation as well leaves something to be desired. not only does it raise interesting character relationship questions, but there are also some grammatical mistakes that simply shouldn't have been allowed to pass.  another thing i found interesting was that you lose main party characters--one dies, and the other basically becomes useless to the party and leaves. while the death of the one character is often said to have no point, it makes you realize early on that the characters, while heroes, are still just as mortal as the next person. the people who replace the lost characters simply gain all their stats, so the transition game play-wise is fairly smooth. perhaps my one complaint about the characters is the main character's love interest, shana. she is the epitome of the helpless female in need of rescuing, pathetic to the point of driving a player to screaming with frustration. while you can use her in your party, she is insanely weak--i don't even know what her dragoon powers are like, as i disliked her so much i never used her. the character rose, by contrast, is probably my favorite female character in any game ever. she's no wimp, and some of her dragoon magic is extremely useful. meru is quite strong as well, while sometimes being an annoying talkative brat.  the character designers were, as most are, inclined to make the female characters appear pretty or whatever, and didn't give much thought to the actual usefulness of the outfits. seriously, no armor and having most of your skin exposed is not helpful when fighting monsters. but i will give them props, as they do have females serving as knights in the various countries.  i can't comment much on the plot, as honestly i didn't pay much attention to it beyond where i needed to go to next. i'm not sure if this says something about the plot itself, or my gaming style.  all in all, it's a very enjoyable game. it has its flaws, but for me it struck just the right balance of having to think and just pressing buttons and killing monsters.",1
"i've been waiting for a superhero movie like this for a long time. ""mystery men"" takes its place among the classic comic-strip spoofs on tv like ""batman"" and ""captain nice"" and cartoons like ""underdog"" and ""super chicken."" the same spirit lives in all of them: the comic tongue-in-cheek tone; the courage to aim for the heroic in life at the risk of looking ridiculous; the not-so-sure-footed way that these characters manage to prevail over their adversaries. it's the misfired spark of nobility igniting in the weak and the ordinary, and it's wonderful to see it glow so high and bright here.  ""mystery men"" opens on a party at a nursing home. i wish kinka usher had had the sense to give more energy and life to the old people in the scene. as it is, it looks like something george romero might have devised. we need to get the feeling that these old people are as sharp as everyone else, or it feels patronizing. by the time the red eyes crash the festivities, you half expect tom waits who plays a weapons inventor with a penchant for ladies in their eighties to stand up and shout: ""just what this party needs--a little excitement!"" if writer neil cuthbert had any sense, he would have had waits mixing it up with the intruders and egging on the partiers to do the same. it would have made for a rousing beginning, and a better introduction of the troublesome trio: the shoveler (william macy); the blue raja (hank azaria); and mr. furious (ben stiller), who seem to come out of nowhere to save the day.   there are many other problems to ""mystery men"" than i care to go into; among them that the villain casanova frankenstein needs to have as cultivated a sense of the absurd as the rest of the people in this movie, and he doesn't. geoffrey rush is the wrong actor for the part; he needs to be way over the top to make the conflict between good and evil a galvanic one. and rush has never exhibited a talent for the outre. you hope for the ripe theatrics of a john lithgow in ""the adventures of buckaroo banzai"" or the dry, debonair diffidence of a paul freeman in ""raiders of the lost ark."" instead what we get is pastiche; something half-baked and not fully realized.  there are too many ideas running through ""mystery men"" for anyone to tie them neatly together, and that may be its deepest problem. but whatever kind of a mess it is is the kind of mess i love. ben stiller has always seemed to be slumming in the roles he takes. this one is no exception, but he goes at it with such conviction that you come away feeling that he'd learned something about comedy growing up in a household run by jerry stiller and anne meara. his roy is related to all the put-upon, overly sensitive, chronically defensive types that woody allen made popular. and whether it's wheedling his way into the affections of the waitress at his favorite hangout (the sleek claire forslani), or questioning the wisdom of a fellow superhero (wes studi as the sphinx), or giving a new member of their ""elite"" group (jeaneane garofalo in what are possibly her funniest moments on screen) a hard time, he makes it always fun to watch. i couldn't exactly say that about him in ""there's something about mary.""  jeaneane garofalo proves with this performance that she should have been the star of ""one true thing,"" not renee zellweger. i don't think i have ever seen funnier exchanges between a daughter and father (okay, so he's dead and his skull is in a bowling ball, so sue me) in the movies. and the funny part about this role is that it feels like a screwball reprise of emily watson's spellbinding talks with god in ""breaking the waves."" and in this version, the girl doesn't die, and bells don't ring in your head.  william h. macy does something very difficult; he makes stolid magnetic. you understand right away what's attracted jenifer lewis' lucille to eddie. you can also understand her exasperation. the barbecue alone would be enough to drive me over the edge, but when eddie's adorable, half-breed son looks up at his father and says ""i believe in you, daddy."" to which lucille sighs and exclaims, ""roland, don't encourage your father,"" you feel like standing and hailing neil cuthbert as a first-rate wit.   with hank azaria (whose only moment of note in film up to this point was his bare behind in ""the birdcage"") and louise lasser (has it been more than two decades since we first took note of her in ""bananas"" and ""mary hartman, mary hartman?"") as son and mother who share a fondness for silverware; greg kinnear as captain amazing and ricky jay as his publicist; kel mitchell as ""invisible boy""; paul reubens as ""the spleen;"" and lena olin who, if she didn't have the few lines in this movie that she has, would seem to be visiting the set.",1
"this movie is a must for all people that enjoy soccer as an art. what strikes first about this movie about a soccer world cup is the way it is filmed. besides following the play like a tv broadcast, there is generous footage dedicated to follow individual players in the games. this brings forward the emotions and situations these men go through as they attempt to reach glory. today's tv broadcasting style, so different than that of 1986, is still inferior in quality compared to this movie.  the players are not the only stars. the audience, the referees, the journalists covering the matches and the environment itself all play a central role in the development of what today is history. in this movie you can see how all these factors play together in a very explicit way. in that regard, today's tv broadcasting style has not yet reached this level of quality, although it is now much closer than before.  there are several highlighted players: maradona (argentina), elkjaer and laudrup (denmark), francescoli (uruguay), platini (france), lineker (england), rummenigge (germany), butrague#o (spain), socrates (brazil), and sanchez (mexico).  this movie is not a collection of the best soccer moves of mexico 1986, although most of them are well covered. across all the movie, there is a stress for presenting several aspects of the game and the competition itself based on the progress of these players and teams, even at the cost of skipping relevant plays of the games themselves. this is what makes this movie so interesting and unique.  because of what happened because of referees during mexico 1986, much of the comments about this movie and world cup are extremely maradona-biased. much of these comments do not take into account that there is a referee and two linesmen, that they are as human as the players, and that all of the abovementioned make mistakes one way or the other. soccer rules do not allow referees to use tv based replays to make decisions, so for the most part referees have to decide on what they perceive. as a consequence, referees play an active part in the development of a game. their influence can be seen in several parts of this movie.  the sequel movie for the 1990 world cup, compared to this one, is just a source of bitter disappointment. much of it comes from the fact that it became too involved in the game, whereas this movie tells things from a more distant, unbiased point of view.",1
"this is to the zatoichi movies as the ""star trek"" movies were to ""star trek""--except that in this case every one of the originals was more entertaining and interesting than this big, shiny re-do, and also better made, if substance is more important than surface. had i never seen them, i would have thought this good-looking but empty; since i had, i thought its style inappropriate and its content insufficient. the idea of reviving the character in a bigger, slicker production must have sounded good, but there was no point in it, other than the hope of making money; it's just a show, which mostly fails to capture the atmosphere of the character's world and wholly fails to take the character anywhere he hasn't been already (also, the actor wasn't at his best). i'd been hoping to see ichi at a late stage of life, in a story that would see him out gracefully and draw some conclusion from his experience overall; this just rehashes bits and pieces from the other movies, seasoned with more sex and sfx violence. not the same experience at all.",0
"absolutely wonderful drama and ros is top notch...i highly recommend this movie. her performance, in my opinion, was academy award material! the only real sad fact here is that universal hasn't seen to it that this movie was ever available on any video format, whether it be tape or dvd. they are ignoring a very good movie. but universal has little regard for its library on dvd, which is sad. if you get the chance to see this somewhere (not sure why it is rarely even run on cable), see it! i won't go into the story because i think most people would rather have an opinion on the film, and too many ""reviewers"" spend hours writing about the story, which is available anywhere.  a 10!",1
"the same difficulty i have with the musical version of ""les miserables"" applies equally to ""oliver."" instead of the composers' writing in the stylistic period of the play settings, they merely wrote broadway-type melodies, which were historically unidiomatic and stylistically skewed.  too, the blatant brutality and unsavory activities of the dramaturgy do not mix well with some of the sunny ditties which permeate the score. it's a uncomfortable mixture that leaves a decidedly sour undertaste.  the casting of the boy oliver doesn't help matters: tentative of timbre and vexingly precious, there's something less than solid here. fagin performs his traditional routine adequately, though the tunes he's obliged to sing have little basis in period manner.  ""as long as he needs me"" is given a strident rendition, throaty and strained. the two big production numbers, ""who will buy"" and ""consider yourself"" seem over-produced, with everything but the kitchen sink thrown in. it's one thing to go all out, yet another to cross over the line into excess.   the gloom, despair and depravity of much of the novel does not seem to lend itself to such ditties and choreography. while the novel is considered a classic, i must confess i have trouble with mr. dickens' consciousness, in that his works tend to emit a negative vibration. this may be due to the extension of his joyless personal life, which was full of disappointment and regret.   not all the combined talent of this production, either on- or behind camera, can overcome the unconstructive nature of the basic material. all this results in an uncomfortably downer experience for me.

"you can debate prince's acting talent, or even his choice to parody his own life in this film. there is no debate about his musical talent either then or now. he seems like a shadowy has-been twenty years later, but the music remains relevant and fantastic.   having lived through the hype of this movie (graduated high school in'85) i can tell you that there was nothing bigger at the time. from tipper gore (al's wife) trying to censor ""little nikki"" and every thing else under the sun via the pmrc (parents music resource center) to every ""air band"" at the time impersonating prince, it was the absolute hottest thing out. for a few weeks at least, prince was bigger than madonna and michael jackson.   we all waited for the film and were soooooo excited when it premiered. it didn't disappoint. everyone was caught up. i was an mtv junkie at the time(they actually played music then....all the time)prince played at least once or twice an hour. i must qualify this commentary by saying that, at that time, my favorites were billy idol, oingo boingo, the fixx, flock of seagulls and others in the punk/ new wave genre' the music of prince at the time transcended all types and styles. one of the reasons that some of it seems so cheesy and contrite now is that it was soooooooo big then. all the things that remind you of the 80's were iconic then. it was mainstream and it seems like a cliché' now. it got so popular that it became ridiculous. it's like the rappin' granny commercial for wendy's hamburgers.   it looks stupid now because everyone was caught up in it (sadly, kind of like a bizarre purple macarena or something. anyway, i hope this gave you all a little insight.",1

"in ""anne of green gables"" (1934), marilla cuthbert (helen westley) and matthew cuthbert (o.p. heggie), middle-aged siblings who live together at green gables, a farm in avonlea, on prince edward island, decide to adopt a boy from distant orphanage to help on their farm. but the orphan sent to them is a precocious girl of 14 named anne shirley (dawn evelyn paris-a veteran of disney's series of ""alice"" shorts who later would adopt her character's name).   anne was only 11 in lucy maude montgomery's source novel but the same actress could not credibly go from 11 to college age during the course of the story. the movie suffers somewhat from this concession, as many of anne's reactions and much of what she says are more entertaining coming from an eleven-year-old that from a teenager. as in the book, anne is bright and quick, eager to please but dissatisfied with her name, her build, her freckles, and her long red hair. being a child of imagination, however, anne takes much joy in life, and adapts quickly to her new family and the environment of prince edward island.  in fact anne is the original ""teenage drama queen"" and the film's screenwriter elected to focus on this aspect of her character. which transformed the basic genre from mildly amusing family drama to comedy. a change that delighted audiences and that continues to frustrate reader purists.   since the comedy is very much in the spirit of the montgomery's story i can see no reason to take issue with the changes, but let this serve as fair warning to anyone expecting a totally faithful adaptation. the comedy element is the strength of the film as it is one of the earliest self-reflexive parodies of hollywood conventions. the actress anne shirley was one of hollywood's all- time beauties and the film is in black and white. so much of the amusement is in seeing the title character's endless laments about her appearance and hair color contradicted by what is appearing on the screen. anne regularly regales her no nonsense rural companions with melodramatic lines like: ""if you refuse it will be a lifelong sorrow to me"". perhaps the funniest moment is when she corrects the spelling of her name on the classroom blackboard.   tom brown does a nice job as anne's love interest gilbert blythe and sara haden steals all the scenes in which she appears as the cuthbert's pompous neighbor.   then again, what do i know? i'm only a child.",1
"this movie should be required viewing for all librarians or would-be librarians. all of the best lines are directly related to librarianship. the public library vs. academic library argument is a classic argument waged among librarians and library school students. it also breaks many librarian stereotypes. librarians might even be capable of having fun -- even if they don't *usually* have sex in the romance languages section!

"when people nowadays hear of a 1940s drama, they usually appear to create a distance of irony claiming that it's another tearjerker with great stars in the lead of tragic, melancholic roles. this opinion, however, does not resemble neorealist movies, in particular this one directed by count luchino visconti. ossessione as his debut once censored and once cherished as nearly a realistic masterpiece is still loved by some people and strongly criticized by others. the contradictory opinions about the film that have appeared in these 65 years seem to have been caused by the content of the movie itself, exceptionally controversial for modern times as well as the past. at the same time, while being based on the novel by james m. cain, the postman always rings twice, it is one of the most genuine screen adaptations where director remains his own style, view, his own art. i have seen the film twice and the second viewing led me to very detailed analysis part of which i'd like to entail below.  first, visconti's movie seems to touch all psychology and actions that people may do in life, in particular those absorbed by desire. these people make such tragic decisions in spite of terrible consequences they are bound to face. gino (massimo girotti) a traveler with ""bear like shoulders"" turns up at the crossroad of a motorway near ferrara and enters the tavern. although many people go there to have a meal, gino occurs to get something more - much more: the indefatigable desire of beautiful giovanna (clara calamai) a woman already married to an elderly man who runs the bar, mr giuseppe bragana (juan de landa). her body and her song possess his mind totally and from the moment of their first love, the couple plan to get rid of the old obstacle and build up a new life together... however, are people bound to wrong deeds in face of desire? can one build love upon murder? what is love and what is loyalty? does desire lead to a dangerous addiction or even obsession? such questions intensely arise while watching the movie, when, to the core, the viewer is supplied with an insight into characters. ""we have to love each other affectionately"" answers giovanna seemingly giving a cure to all crying conscience but may desirous love justify and cure everything? ""isn't it what we both wanted"" says one of the couple... it occurs that it's not. therefore, the content of the film appears to be very dangerous if not analyzed with intellect and heart. yet, it constantly remains thought provoking.  second, ossessione has a very strong point that talks to modern viewers: brilliant moments and marvelous cinematography, which go in pair with memorable sequences and visual power. these make a modern viewer realize that a film made almost 70 years ago is absolutely entertaining to watch. they range from tasteful erotic images to purely technical shots. who can possibly skip that moment in ferrara where gino meets a beautiful girl, a sort of ""ragazza perfetta"" (perfect girl), a dancer anita and buys her ice cream. his desires show him totally different direction... do viewers remain indifferent at gino-giovanna's first meeting? the first focus of camera is on giovanna's legs seemingly representing carnal desire over love that gino experiences. a marvel of shot is gino and giovanna leaving the investigation room and the closeup of their shadows that directs our attention towards their suspicious look.  third, ossessione can boast outstanding performances both from the leading pair as well as the supporting cast. massimo girotti once said in an interview that working in this movie had been one of the most difficult jobs he had ever done; yet, consequently, what comes out is a flawless acting. he portrays a bisexual man torn within desires who commits a crime but cannot stand any of the objects that remind him of his victim, which represents conscience. his bisexuality is indicated through the character of lo spagnolo (elio marcuzzo) whom he meets in very surprising circumstances in the train for ancona. clara calamai, who was cast in the role after eminent anna magnani had refused, fits very well to the role and we may claim that there is a true chemistry between the couple. they are both very convincing. besides, i liked juan de langa in the role of bragana: he portrays an old husband not affectionate to his wife and still crazy about high art. in some of his most witty moments, he asks his wife to wash his back or walks in the empty streets singing his favorite opera songs after sort of karaoke performance.  in sum, we, as modern viewers who are capable of critical view, have to look at this film very objectively. it is art for sure thanks to the aspects aforementioned, it is a powerful story as well thanks to the controversy it carries; yet, is it educational? visconti was not fellini who said that he did not carry any message for humanity. in such case, his films would only entertain (which is, of course, not entirely fellini's style, too). visconti always had something to convey. what did he want to say here? is the film against bad marriage? or is it against wrong actions of people absorbed by desire? the final shocking moments say for themselves. though you don't have to agree with the vision, ossessione is really a wonderfully realistic film, one of visconti's best 8/10",1
"iq is a cute romantic comedy featuring two great actors that seem to click well on screen. plot is a typical guy wrong for girl, guy gets girl format, but makes the solid point that one must love with the heart and not the the mind. addition of albert einstein and his band of geniuses provides excellent comic relief. overall, a good movie. not great, but good",1
"after coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes. though i guess not. if the first one wasn't bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch. with all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever. though they couldn't, they had to take all the same raunchy, not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again. though the thing is i didn't laugh at it the first time. they tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level. most of the time it's just randomly inserted jokes, that are so disgusting and raunchy that it's hard to watch it and enjoy it. then when they do try to do scenes that are movie parodies they just end up making a 20 minute recreation of the scene with maybe one joke within the entire scene. also for people saying that its not for the older and real young audience, well i fit into the age range that it's supposed to be funny for. while people say that different people have different ideas of what is funny or not, if you do find this funny then you probably aren't one of the more mature or intelligent people around. it doesn't take that much skill to write that kind of a script, though if you do want a more clever and funnier movie go see the movie spaceballs. it's a movie parody that's actually good and well done and it didn't have to use disgusting and raunchy jokes to make it funny either.",0
"all of the reviews here about how much zp lacks plot, the acting is wooden, the orgy scene makes no sense, etc., all miss the main point.  let's be honest. this is a movie made in the heady times of late 1960s and early 1970s los angeles. it is a movie meant to be watched while your are h-i-g-h out of your mind on some psychedelic substance.  find some kind bud and smoke up, or get a mild hit of acid. seriously, these straight and sober reviews of zp miss the point. you can't get anything out of this movie in a straight frame of mind.  until you've watched this movie on the big screen (which i am lucky to have done three times in the 1990s when zp was quite rare) tripping out, you have no idea what this movie is all about.  if you insist on watching it not intoxicated, you can at least appreciate the ending when the crap blows up to the soundtrack of pink floyd's wonderful re-working of ""careful with that axe, eugene,"" ""come in number 51, your time is up.""",1
"here's yet another film from the 80's that most people just don't know exists. this slow, picturesque (the loving shots of the montana landscapes are breathtaking and reminded me of costner's recent ""open range"", which also starred robert duval), and emotionally satisfying film is the perfect type of movie to watch late one night when you can't sleep or on a listless sunday afternoon. those in the right mood will be treated to a finely detailed and intimate look at the grief of one family and how they come back together after the youngest son accidentally shoots and kills the eldest son while hunting. the performances are all top notch and quietly nuanced. glenn close, robert duval, and wilford brimley are pitch perfect in their portrayals, as are all the supporting players and young actors. i especially liked how director cain (who unfortunately hasn't directed anything of note since this except the first ""young guns"") gives us quiet little glimpses into everyone's personal grief. we don't just see how the death effects the younger brother or the parents, but also the confused middle sister, the wayward uncle, his crazy wife, and the dead teenager's girlfriend. what we essentially get here is the rural mid-western answer to ""ordinary people."" there's also shades of david lynch's ""the straight story"" in some of the stoic downhome mid-west morality of the folks depicted here and also in the lovingly haunting shots of the farmland they inhabit. this is one of the better and more realistic ""tear-jerkers"" of the era, and a nice little find for you quality movie hunters out there.",1
"i hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity. hyung-rae shim is lucky that bad film-making isn't a capital crime or he'd be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster. i'm amazed that this film had a $75m budget, but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop, that shim will hopefully, never get to make another movie the rest of the life and, therefore, not waste any more of filmgoers time. i would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by now.  with the effects resources available to them, a great film could have been made with this budget. as usual, the failure should have been spotted at the very beginning with the terrible script and story. ""transformers"" was another visual feast with a weak script, but this makes it look like ""citizen kane"".",0
"like the characters in this show, i too was a teen during the 70s. the producers really nailed the whole zeitgeist, of being a suburban teenager in the 70s. the 70s fashions, cars, home furnishings, foods, and fads, are all very authentic in this show.  the show boasts a very talented ensemble cast, who all mesh together very well on camera. i really like the unique, psychedelic-style film sequences. no other show does camera tricks like this. these cutting-edge film sequences, really help to convey the campy hipness, that characterized the 70s era.  overall this is a very funny sitcom. the one thing that bothers me about this show, is it's over-reliance on cruel humor, to generate laughs. in this way, i think that this show tries to be too much like married with children. while married with children is a great sitcom in its own right, it's tacky that the creators of that 70s show, keep trying to imitate it.   i do recommend that 70s show, mainly due to it's nostalgia factor. it could be an even better show though, if the writers relied more on witty dialog, rather than bawdy, tasteless jokes and pranks.",1
"first, let me state that i am a big fan of ashley judd; that's why i was curious to check out this, her debut role. no argument that her talent is apparent and her performance excellent. i guess i can also see how the professional critics liked the aesthetic content of the story. however, i like to think that movies are meant to entertain us and that is where this movie fails.  by the halfway point, i found myself thinking, ""how much longer do we have to watch a bored shop girl, idly standing around a deserted souvenir shop, rearranging the merchandise?"" it seemed to go on forever!  then, i thought, maybe this is one of those movies where the director tries to lull the audience into a relaxed state before hitting them with some dynamic event. no such luck. the movie continues it's bland, boring, uneventful story all the way to the end.  i'm not saying this because i'm an action-junkie. i like all kinds of movies, especially romantic-comedies. but i expect to be entertained.  add the fact that the cinematography and sound quality are comparable to your neighbor's bad home movies. depressing!  i just don't get how anyone could like this movie. zero-entertainment value. the longest 114 minutes of my life.

"an adaption of the book 'finding fish'. this story is about a troubled young sailor antwone fisher (derek luke) who tells the painful story of his past to a psychiatrist jerome davenport (denzel washington). a brilliant debut performance by derek luke and an always stunning performance by denzel washington.  this movie was incredible on so many levels and i was disappointed that it didn't win an oscar, i think it was because it was released at a bad time that's why it was overlooked. i strongly recommend this film to everyone, you'll be touched by his story and it really does make the audience become empathetic with this young man that is antwone fisher.  if you like inspirational true stories, then watch antwone fisher.  thank you",1
"this is a sad film made for sad people. i was sitting in theaters tearing my hair apart, wanting to break the chairs in front of me as the movie spitted out one cringe-inducing scenes after another. and there were people roaring with laughter behind me, which made me wonder what kind of films these people must be watching to actually enjoy this horse-s**t.  nikkhil advani has six stories with no plot and no interesting characters. the screenplay is dull, probably he was drunk when he was writing this film. there is no strong hold on any of these stories. nothing new , nothing to hold the audience and filled with dialogs which you would have heard a million times before. one of the stories is about this couple not being able to have sex because of series of disasters taking place every time they want to do it. i mean seriously is this story really required? its not funny, not creative but only proves that advani has no sense of comedy. another of the stories (which was probably the only story i was interested in) is based on a man's infidelity and that too ends in a lame age-old sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. i have no idea what the salmaan-priyanka plot was all about. there was no issue in the plot for it to be a plot. she can't take karan johar's film because she has to marry salmaan ?? why can't she marry him and still take the film ?? or does advani and priyanaka just want to prove the world that it is in fact true that female actors cant be successful if they are married or that they should not act in films once they are married?? with six actors in the film obviously advani cant produce the film all by himself. so he makes full use of sponsors like the times group, shamelessly promoting their filmfare magazines. and also some jewelery brand which the women in the film absolutely seem to adore!! i come to imdb to give it the worst rating and i am shocked to see posts praising the film. it just goes to show the sad state of bollywood and how star struck the fans are. with fans like these, movies like salaam e ishq will be continue to be made and worse probably be a hit.",0
"i anticipated the release of the film as much as any fan of the broadway play. i waited and read reviews for months about the award winning performances. i mean with the star power of eddie murphy, jamie foxx, beyonce knowles, danny glover... the movie couldn't be less than 4 out of 4 stars, right? wrong! i was definitely disappointed by the finished product. the film did not match up to the publicity hype it was given and the only saving graces were eddie murphy, anika noni rose and jennifer hudson.  eddie murphy's james brownesque performance rescues the movie just when it hits its multiple lulls and jennifer hudson's performance compels you to pay attention each time she's on screen. her performance of ""and i am telling you"" was the only time that i felt the hype was deserved. you cringed as she begged her no good man to let her stay in the group and in his life. as many reviewers have stated, she steals the movie from the more experienced actors and deserves all the accolades she's receiving for this performance. anika noni rose was also a strong presence with a great voice and comedic talent.   jamie foxx and beyonce knowles, on the other hand, cruised through their performances. foxx's acting skills for this film seemed to predate his extraordinary ""ray"" performance and beyonce knowles was on an extended fashion photo shoot or video taping, posing and shimmying her way through the movie. her performance wasn't strong enough to make you care about her character at any point in the film.  the movie was too hyped, 30 minutes and 1 song (beyonce's ""heartfelt"" solo to jamie foxx) too long.  dh -- vancouver, wa",0
"seeing this movie, as i just did for the first time on turner classic (which lists it as ""dangerous female""), can only multiply your appreciation for the 1941 bogart-astor version. ricardo cortez must have been getting paid by the smirk. i hope he remembered his dentist and his brylcreem salesman in his will; they made him the actor he was. the women are all good, but no better than that. well, una merkel is a little better. more interesting are the ""original"" joel cairo and mr. gutman, who competently deliver many of the individual tics but almost nothing of the set-changing atmospherics of their successors in the roles, peter lorre and sydney greenstreet. humphrey bogart and mary astor somehow transcended the essential seediness of their characters in the remake; here, sam spade and ruth wonderley(!) can't.   this movie doesn't exactly stink; it lies there like a big slice of ham. its chief value today is as a reminder that great movies like the '41 ""falcon"" don't just happen. on the 1-to-10 scale i rate it a 4, mainly for the camera work and the supporting players.",0
"the basic storyline here is, aditiya (kumar) is the spoilt son of a millionaire, ishwar (bachan) who owns a toy industry, in ishwar's eyes his son aditya can do nothing wrong, aditya's mother sumitra (shefali shah) warns ishwar to bring his son to the responsible path before it is too late, for ishwar is a patient of lung cancer and has only 9 months to live, when his son elopes and marries mitali (chopra), ishwar readily forgives aditya, but when the happy couple aditya and mitali come back from a honeymoon, mitali is pregnant, and this forces ishwar to kick aditya out of the house to make him more responsible, aditya doesn't know his father is suffering from lung cancer, and he also doesn't know that his father has kicked him out of the hose to make him more responsible, ishwar cannot bring himself to tall aditya that he is about to die, with a hungry and pregnant wife. it is a race against time so aditya does all he can to prove himself to his father, and the climax comes when aditya gets his big break in the movie industry and his father tells him that he is about to die.  this movie is absolutely brilliant, this is the breakthrough in indian cinema that was needed for the bollywood industry, shah's directing is almost flawless, but which movie doesn't have flaws? the best part if this movie is the father son relationship which is a tearjerker. the song interludes is just placed at the right time, the scenery is good, the only part where this movie fails is where the jokes between boman irani and rajpal yadav the jokes are too long and after a bit they are annoying, but overall this is a brilliant movie, i advise anybody reading this review to go and watch it regardless of other reviews. 9/10",1
"evidently when you offer a actor enough money they will do anything. i am not sure how much john rys-daves got, but most of the money he made should go to his fans as an apology for even being associated with such a rotten movie. the special effects were worse then effects from the 1950's b movies and the acting of the rest of the cast was even worse. as to how bad the acting was a child gave the second best performance in my opinion. the english was terribly accented and i think no one could really even speak english they just memorized how the words should sound instead of memorizing the script and trying to make their character both ""life-like"" and real.",0

"(spoilers in this)  ""rosenstraße"" is a movie about heroic women in german nazi time. but it is way too long, it is not touching and sometimes even boring! there are too many clichés and not enough good acting.  the storytelling (storyline) is bad. like in james cameron´s titanic an old woman remembers events of her live. good, now we´ve got a point of view. than there is another woman introduced who does the same. confusing is that they both are recalling events of lifes of other people! come on! this is a lack of knowledge of basic story telling...how can riemann know about the fate of the little girl´s mother and her interrogation for example?  the scenes are shown in the wrong order and you rarely know when it took place. for example the scene when riemann is proposing to fabian. when did that happen? the scene looks like it is set in the twenties...  riemann´s character is of course a talented pianist, well, she is even a baroness! wow. her brother comes back from the eastern front, he has received a ""ritterkreuz"" which he is showing in some scenes. so he is a war hero and still a fine man who preserved his conscience. and he gained knowledge of massacres committed by germans. he even made some photographs! and so it goes, cliché after cliché is piling up and this is why the movie does not work.  basically von trotta made a chick flick out of something what could have been a decent movie. and in the end it´s all very simple. riemann finds a way to get goebbels into bed and - ta da! - everyone is free. which is not a historical fact but pure imagination despite the ""true story"" claim at the beginning. like ""sass"" it is vaguely based on a true event.  it is sad but true, this is the typical german movie these days. it is bad! macaulay j. connor  ",0

"bo derek's debut film remained unseen for eight years  and that's how it should stayed! john derek was a competent actor but, as a director, he's virtually the ed wood of erotic cinema  not that this is especially explicit, considering that bo (atypically sporting dark hair) was only 16 when the film was made! john also wrote and photographed it; the latter results in some decent footage of the greek island setting against which the narrative is set  but the plotting is puerile and the dialogue atrocious!   the character played by male lead peter hooten has been brought up with bo's family: they grew up as brother and sister but, now in their teens, the couple discover they're attracted to one another (but, as i said, don't expect any sexual fireworks!). still, the worst thing about this is the fact that the protagonists each harbor an obsession all through the film which are not only silly in themselves but irritating in their relentlessness  hooten wants to turn the remote fishing community into a modernized sea-side resort and keeps expecting a cruise-liner to appear into view (which, of course, it does at the finale); derek's is even nuttier  she craves possession of a large antique bath-tub!! for the record, the couple are married by the end of the film.  also involved in the non-events are the female town mayor and a photographer lothario who wants to make a model out of bo (and who, naturally, incurs the wrath of the jealous hooten). occasionally, for no very good reason, we're even treated to snippets from the screening of old hollywood classics in an open-air movie house to which the whole town assembles (among the titles shown is the public enemy [1931])! at the end of the day, while bo's naivete throughout is undeniably charming, it's not enough to offset the film's overwhelming dullness and amateurishness.",0

"the robin cook novel ""coma"" had already been turned into a pretty successful movie in 1978. a couple of years later it was the turn of another robin cook bestseller to get the big screen treatment , but in the case of ""sphinx"" virtually everything that could go wrong does go wrong. this is a dreadful adventure flick consisting of wooden performances, stupid dialogue, unconvincing characters and leaden pacing. the only reason it escapes a 1-out-of-10 rating is that the egyptian backdrop provides infinitely more fascination than the story itself. hard to believe franklin j. schaffner (of ""patton"" and ""planet of the apes"") is the director behind this debacle.  pretty egyptologist erica baron (lesley anne-down) is on a working vacation in cairo when she stumbles across the shop of antiques dealer abdu-hamdi (john gielgud). hamdi befriends erica and is impressed by her enthusiasm and knowledge. consequently, he shows her a beautiful and incredibly rare statue of pharoah seti i that he is keeping secretly in his shop. the very existence of the statue arouses intense excitement in erica, for it could provide vital clues in locating seti i's long-lost tomb, a prize as great as the discovery of tutankhamun's tomb in 1922. before hamdi can tell erica any more he is brutally murdered in his shop, with erica watching in silent terror as he meets his grisly end. afraid yet tantalised by what she has seen, erica attempts to track down the treasure. she finds herself helped and hindered in her quest by various other parties, none of whom are truly trustworthy. for one there is yvon (maurice ronet), seemingly a friend but perhaps a man with sinister ulterior motives? then there is akmed khazzan (frank langella), an egyptian for whom erica feels a certain attraction but who may also be hiding dangerous secrets from her.  the biggest problems with ""sphinx"" generally result from its total disregard for plausibility. down couldn't be less convincing as a female egyptologist  one assumes she would be quite well-educated and resourceful, yet she spends the entire film screaming helplessly like some busty bimbo from a teen slasher flick. on those rare occasions that she actually isn't running from a potential villain, she does other brainless things such as taking polaroid flash photos in a 4,000 year old tomb! the plot twists are heavy-handed to say the least, mainly comprising of revelations and double-crosses that can be predicted well in advance. one can't even try to enjoy the film on the level of dumb but entertaining action fare, because the pacing is awfully sluggish. what little action can be found is separated by long stretches of tedium. a famous review of the movie declared: ""sphinx stinks!"" never before has a 2-hour film been so aptly summed up in 2 words.",0
"the larger-than-life figures of wyatt earp and bat masterson, and the specters of george armstrong custer and sitting bull, loom over director anthony mann's hugely entertaining first western with james stewart. although stewart's quest to avenge his father's murder is the primary story, winchester '73 is really an ensemble piece, with the eponymous, one-in-a-thousand firearm passing through the hands of many colorful owners, including a wry trader (john mcintire, especially great) and outlaw dan duryea, who's even more despicable than usual. the film's conflation of fiction and history produces a breezy pace and an ambivalent tone brilliantly in step with mann's pared-down, compositionally rigorous film-making. his themes of psychological unrest and past dictating present faintly underlie this tall tale of good and bad men chasing after a fabled gun, but they starkly emerge in a vignette about a husband's cowardice and failed attempt at atonement, and are defined in stewart's conversations with sidekick millard mitchell. mann's use of environment is what sets him apart from other filmmakers of westerns. instead of gazing at vistas from afar, he incorporates them into the drama as characters that redirect, complicate, or evoke the human characters' goals. just as mountains, caves, and rapids had to be accounted for in the naked spur, here a gunfight occurs amidst the loose rocks and boulders of a small mountain, a physical obstruction that fatalistically determines the roles of victor and victim between two equally skilled sharpshooters. (i would be remiss in not recognizing cinematographer william h. daniels's contribution, particularly his superlative day-for-night, open-range photography.) not merely an adept outdoorsman, mann presents an equally vivid picture of wyatt earp-patrolled dodge city, primarily through scaled, multiple-plane staging. the shooting contest does not depend on brisk camera shifts or twitchy cuts for effect because mann instinctively knows where to place the camera and how to move it to display the greatest density of information in a given shot. nor does he care to spell out the plot in dialogue, relying on the actors' eyes or a well-chosen image to convey the stakes. one scene in particular serves to explain his attitude: mitchell's telling of stewart's motivation to shelley winters, which is interrupted by the climactic gunfight that soon enough reveals all. light without feeling insubstantial, intense without being overbearing, winchester '73 seems more modern than its contemporaries and is a joy to behold.",1
"in the questionable comedy vein of mel brooks, ""wholly moses!"" tries to take the bible story of moses and make fun of it, resulting in the unfunniest biblical spoof ever filmed.  there is no real plot here, just excuses to trot out stalwart comedy talent in underwritten roles. dudley moore and laraine newman are on a bus tour of the holy land, when they stumble across an ancient scroll in a cave. there they read the story of herschel and zerelda, also played by moore and newman. herschel's life parallels moses'. he was sent down the river to be found by the pharaoh's family at the same time moses was. herschel's birth father, the late james coco, becomes herschel's slave after herschel is rescued by idol makers and works as a sculptor. eventually herschel comes to work for the pharaoh as an astronomer, is banished, and ends up tending moses' flock of sheep. herschel and moses are brothers in law, marrying sisters, and herschel thinks god has chosen him to free his people in egypt. of course, moses was receiving the divine word, but herschel misunderstood. i'll pause here to laugh hysterically...pause...anyway, the rest of the film is a series of badly written scenes involving moore and actors who are making ""special appearances."" these scenes do not propel the plot forward, they bring what little story there is to a grinding halt.  jack gilford plays a tailor. dom deluise has maybe three lines when he meets herschel in the desert. john houseman is an archangel, just giving the same line readings he gave in ""the paper chase."" david l. lander is a fake blind man ""healed"" by herschel. andrea martin is one of zerelda's sisters. i was not sure who madeline kahn was supposed to be, she gives a ride to herschel, and has about a minute and a half of screen time. john ritter plays a very unfunny devil. richard pryor has one scene as the pharaoh, but it was obviously shot at a different time than moore's scene because the two do not appear onscreen together! in the end, zerelda turns into a pillar of salt after looking back on new sodom's destruction, ha ha. herschel writes the ten commandments, and gives them to moses, who is basking in all the glory. in the final scenes, the screenwriter decide to try and salvage this shallow film by having herschel bait god into an argument. god comes off as an all powerful bully who was leading herschel around for his own amusement, speaking through him only to give him the ten commandments. we even have zerelda quip ""god works in mysterious ways,"" thereby excusing everyone's very unchristian behavior during the film.  this film is not funny. there is nary a laugh to be found anywhere. at least monty python made fun of many established religious mainstays in ""life of brian"" in addition to their questionable take on jesus' life, but here the humor consists of poo poo jokes and characters constantly bumping their heads. this makes mel brooks look like merchant/ivory. churchgoers will be offended, not by the film's attitude toward religion, but by the smugness the movie exhibits, impressed with their own hoitytoityness (i know, not a word) on a subject they obviously know nothing about. ""wholly moses!"" is wholly bad, and an embarassment to all involved. i suggest you read the book instead.  this is rated (pg) for some physical violence, profanity, sexual references, and adult situations.",0
"i just accidentally stumbled over this film on tv one day. it was aired in the middle of the day on a channel not exactly famous for airing good movies. this one, however, was nothing less then good.  october sky tells the true story of homer hickam, a boy inspired by the sputnick launch to become a rocket scientist. he and his friends begin to build rockets. his father is not to happy about his sons new found hobby and would rather see him become a coal-miner as himself or go to college on a football-scholarship like his brother.  the story is well written. a bit too predictable maybe, but that's ok cause it doesn't focus too much on those parts of the story. it's important part, but where this is obvious the inner action, the action between the characters is focused on. the story is good. it has some clichés, but that's ok. it's based on actual event's so you kind of can't just drop out these clichés. the characters are really good. where the story is on a downhill the characters are brought out and manage to keep the action and the quality of the movie high. you get to know these characters and you get sympathy for them. they are well written and believable.  this is a good looking movie. the sets and the 50's style is thorough and the pictures are well composed and well lit. this all sets the mood of the film very good.  the acting is really good. jake gyllenhaal delivers a great performance as homer hickam and chris cooper is good as john hickam. as for the rest of the cast they are good too. all together this makes out a pretty strong cast.  all in all i'm glad i caught this movie. it was first after seeing it i learned that it was based on actual events. if i had known that when seeing it, it would probably just be even more interesting. october sky is a good and interesting movie. it's a movie i believe everyone can enjoy. it's kind of a feel-good movie. not bad at all!",1
"budget, decent actors ...who knew these things were important. don't waste your time on this piece of junk. the effects are crap. the acting is crap. the only thing that could have made this even tolerable was a little cheap t&a and that gets squandered in the first 20 minutes.  the only even remotely redeeming quality about this movie is the very awkward profanity. it was like they found the only 7 people on the planet who have never cursed before. hats off!  if you want to see some dude in a bad suit just go back and look at old prom photos. the only way for a bigfoot flick to be any good is for it to have a big budget and some actors who didn't come from frogballs community theater.",0
"i enjoyed this movie and i had very low expectation due to all the negative reviews i read before going. i went because i was curious as to what all this fuss was about because some of the postings were so angry with this movie and with the koreans. oh and it's from korea which has put out some of my favorite movies. i liked host but not my absolute favorite. some of my favorite sci-fi /fantasy movies so you can have a sense of my taste: mirrormask, stardust, serenity, gattaca, willow, matrix, resident evil series, lotr, stargate, dark city.  it wasn't confusing like everyone said and the monsters looked good and the battles great. there are some holes in the story but didn't really matter. i sort of tune out stuff like that and stopped asking why long time ago when i see summer blockbusters. the korean legend was interesting, the reincarnation stuff was different, and i thought the main characters suspiciously dressed like korean actors in other shows. ethan's(behr)hair looked so asian.  yes, it could be better and i hope in the future that korea, with its unusual quirky sense of life, intense emotions, and unexpected humor, can bring some diversity to the blockbuster genre. maybe a combination of host and dragon wars in the future?",1
"this is quite the gripping, fascinating, tragic story. quite good, and for the most part pretty accurate, considering it is a tv movie rather than a documentary. they did create some fictional characters, and combine several actual people into one character, but otherwise this is a good telling of a very tragic and dark story.  the final moments of the movie, depicting the mass suicide/murder, are almost directly taken from an audio recording made by jim jones. this recording was made during the final 44 minutes of the peoples temple's existence. it is available in several places on the internet. this portion of the film is almost spot on in that regard.  to sum up, a documentary this is not. however, it does cover most of the base elements to the people's temple story.",1
"i borrowed this movie from library think it might be delightful. how wrong am i!  it is such a bad movie that i have to write something about it. mira sorvino is so bad in the movie, it is very painful to watch the scene with her. she is a pretty girl, but in this movie, she is not seductive at all, but i will have to witness her awkward attempt to seduce almost all the other major characters. it is so ridiculous.  and the dialog of the film is so pretentious, and lack the humorous fact that make then acceptable.  totally failure.",0
"i'm not sure this is a spoiler; perhaps it is a public service. if you are one of those people focused on instant gratification who skip end credits, you will miss the final line of the end credits news announcer's voice-over, which states the u.s. has just surrendered to nazi germany on may 7, 1945 to end wwii. here are just a few of the problems with this close:   1)the older viewer must conjure up the equivalent of two or three more unholy movies in their mind's eye to fill in the yawning chasm between movie events and this startling conclusion.  2)the average person will really kick themselves that they did not ""watch"" one of these unholy fill-in-the-blanks flicks created in their own head for free, instead of shelling out time and money to see this unholy from the video store (or on cable).  3)this end credits sequence of imagined news bulletins may be the first information some younger viewers are exposed to about wwii, leading them to the conclusion that george w. bush is the latest heir to the nazi throne.",0
"just saw this movie, and what a waste of time. the movie was predictable and slow. it's basically the mormon bad news bears that play church sanctioned basketball. rather than watching this movie, i should have had a root canal. the cameo performances were obviously driven by sponsorship / funding. this movie had potential due to the outrageous behavior that is exhibited by mormons when they play church sanctioned basketball, however because it's rated pg, the true nature of the spectacle could not be transfered to film. the acting is horrible with the exception of clint howard and fred willard. thurl bailey's appearance in the film was completely unnecessary.",0
"this was quite possibly the worst film i've ever seen. the plot didn't make a whole lot of sense and the acting was awful. i'm a big fan of amber benson, i think she's usually a wonderful actress, i can't imagine why she decided to do this film. her character, piper, is drunk for almost the whole film, with the exception of the opening scene. on the plus side, there was several points in the film where the acting was so bad, i actually laughed out loud. but despite that, i would not recommend this film to anyone. it's only 80 minutes long, but that's 80 minutes of your life that you will have completely wasted.",0
"coming of age movies are quite usual these days. for 1980, ""foxes"" really gives its meaning. jodie foster plays her character straight out. ever since she did ""taxi driver"" four years earlier, she has a stronger character in this movie. she's jeanie, a high schooler who has plenty of guts, and seems to get out of any situation she's in. scott baio plays brad way before chachi on ""happy days"". he's deemed immature by the other girls. cherie currie is annie, hangs with the wrong crowd, chased by her policeman father. jeanie and her three other friends decide to live on the wild side until they move into a rented house where a party get totally out of hand. exploring life on the other side of the tracks can be either fun or dangerous. annie is rescued by jeanie and brad all the time whenever she gets wasted. reality comes back hard where she is killed in a automobile accident. and one gets married to a much older man. growing up isn't easy, sometimes we got to explore life how it is. in reality, you got to be careful about the people surrounding you. for me, i was my own person, and i tend to stay that way! great music, great plot, this movie's a gem! 4 out of 5 stars!",1

"my observations: vamp outfit at end is ravishing and wonderful, exotic and fantastic. jeanette wore it well, and got even with naive nelson. boat crashing into his balcony served him right. costume outfits of his female mafia were designed surprisingly well, especially by today's standards. 1942 costume designer did great job. main song theme just lovely.  caution to negative posters: 1942 was time of ww ii; pearl harbor happened year before. u.s. just coming out of great depression; needed to get out and spend that hard earned money on diversion of singing, dance and yes, fantastic fantasy. despotic dictators were trying to rule out there in rl, snuffing out freedoms. thank goodness the public had these fantastic plot line movies to attend. movie going was a privileged treat, in those depressing times. when you, negative posters, become actors or even movie stars, then you have room to talk and criticize. jeanette's and nelson's movies stand the test of time.  angel wings wonderful, on the real angel. rl wings at costume party not so hot, but great on jeanette considering the sl.  beautiful singing by jeanette and nelson, as always. jeanette dancing was a pure delight.  15/10",1
"steven seagal, mr. personality himself, this time is the united states' greatest stealth pilot who is promised a pardon from the military(..who attempted to swipe his memory at the beginning of the movie for which he escaped base, later caught after interrupting a gang of robbers in a shootout at a gas station)if he is able to successfully infiltrate a northern afghanistan terrorist base operated by a group called black sunday, who have commandeered an air force stealth fighter thanks to an american traitor. along with a fellow pilot who admired the traitor, jannick(mark bazeley), john sands(seagal)will fly into enemy territory, receiving help from his arab lover, jessica(ciera payton)and a freedom fighter, rojar(alki david) once they are on ground. jannick is kidnapped by black sunday leaders, stone(vincenzo nicoli)and his female enforcer, eliana(katie jones), and sands must figure out how to not only re-take command of the kidnapped stealth fighter, but rescue him as well. and, maybe, sands can get revenge on the traitor he trained, rather(steve toussaint)in the process. sands has 72 hours until a general's navy pilots bomb the entire area. on board the stealth, black sunday equipped a biochemical bomb, hoping to detonate it on the united states.  seagal gets a chance to shoot afghans when he isn't slicing their throats with knives. the film is mostly machine guns firing and bodies dropping dead. the setting of afghanistan doesn't hold up to scrutiny(..nor does how easily seagal and co. are able to move about the area undetected so easily) and the plot itself is nothing to write home about. the movie is edited fast, the camera a bit too jerky. seagal isn't as active a hero as he once was and his action scenes are tightly edited where we have a hard time seeing him taking out his foes, unlike the good old days. one of seagal's poorest efforts, and he's as understated as ever(..not a compliment). even more disappointing is the fact that seagal never fights in hand to hand combat with the film's chief villains, tis a shame. he doesn't even snap a wrist or crack a neck in any visible way(..sure we see a slight resemblance of some tool getting tossed around, but it's not as clear a picture as i enjoy because the filmmakers have such fast edits and dizzying close-ups).",0
"the movie deserves 2/10. 1.5 stars for the girl, (i'm sorry i'm biased, i think pretty girl is the only highlight of the movies), and 0.5 for the fact that it is shorter than azumi 1. i watched azumi 1 and 2 in 1 seating. i amazed myself being able to sit through it.   lets talk about the plus points of the movie. the girl. ueto aya is cute. thats all there is to salvage the whole movie. the fact is, if the main character was male, i am sure that most people (including me) would not have touched the movie at all.   now lets talk about the minus points. firstly, it is real draggy, with lots and lots of repeated scenes. scenes of nachi and azumi keeps coming back. it seems more like a drama way of shooting. typical japanese dramas love flashbacks, and this movie too. secondly, the movie is too unrealistic in a historical setting. i do not mind unrealistic movies. but this movie is like a poor way of showing creativeness, by throwing in ninjas that act like bears and spider webs, etc... it reminds me of shinobi, though shinobi is a movie with a fantasy setting. moreover, to portray ""i-don't-know"" what effect, the director films people dying with blood spraying (literally) all around... people not realizing their head was cut off... etc.. etc... etc... too many of these spoils the show. it seems like the anime influence is strong in this movie. it degrades the show greatly. thirdly, isn't azumi supposed to be an assassin. she seems more like an one-man-army to me, just that she is a female. i don't think you see assassins charging into army camps. the only time i felt she acted ""assassin-liked"" was when she killed the kiyomasa kato at the end of azumi 1. lastly, the plot was thin in both movies. its a linear plot with no development and surprises in any way.",0
"kalifornia is a movie about lost ideals. a journey on the darkest road ever. the road of no return. the plot is about a couple that set out to find a better life in california. the man (david duchovny in his best role up to now) wants to write a book about the famous crimes that have happened in america and his girl - who is a photographer - is going to take the pictures. so they set out on a trail of famous murders not knowing what awaits them on the way. to share the journey expenses they decide to find another couple and they put an ad. but the couple that answers it is not just any couple. it is one of the strangest couples ever. the girl is a naive, frail creature that dreams a lot and loves cactuses. the man is exactly the opposite. a cruel ruthless murderer. we learn that early in the film and we follow him along the journey to kalifornia (not with c as usual, but with k, presumably symbolizing the word killer), along his journey of betrayal, murder and finally defeat. all the leads, duchovny, pitt, lewis and forbes give really good performances and you have to take into consideration that when this movie was filmed not even one of them was a star. the photography is amazing, with darkness covering the greatest parts of the movie, and the music suits the dark character of the film. on the whole this is a really good movie. don't miss it. you'll think again before taking some stranger in your car to share the gas with!",1

"the statistics in this movie were well researched. there is no doubt about it! al gore certainly presents his case very well and it is no wonder that this movie got the praise that it got. al gore is certainly quite an actor. he sounds so concerned. but actions speak louder than words! throughout this movie, there are political tidbits and references to his political career sprinkled throughout the movie.  jimmy carter, unlike al gore, is a man of integrity who not only talks the talk, but walks the walk as well. when carter thought we needed to conserve energy, he turned down the thermostat in the white house and got warm by wearing a sweater.  al gore tells us that we have to conserve energy and claims that we are creating global warming while he travels around in his own private jet. how much energy does his jet use and how much more pollution does his jet create? how much energy does it take to heat gore's swimming pool behind his mansion? it would be nice if we could conserve electricity by using smaller appliances and making it a point to turn off anything that is not being used. but if we did, the power company would react to a 50% reduction of energy by calling it a ""50% loss in revenue"" and recouping their losses by raising the rates by 50%. so ""just turning it off"" would not be a very good idea.  this movie is a veiled appeal to allow big goivernment to take control of everything, in the name of saving planet earth, that is.",0

"i was lucky enough to watch this without any pre viewing hype. i was surprised at the resilience of the ghost's image in my mind the next day, and the day after that. i've watched it 3-4 times, and each time i appreciate it even more. the settings are gorgeous, the town at dusk has beautiful lighting effects, the marsh long shots, and the house itself is sufficiently grown with moss. the main hero is so likable and good natured, that he is easily sympathized with. to the person who complained that there wasn't enough 'spark' in this film, i'd say that it's because the whole fight against the ghost is being waged by just this one person. it is a fairly slow paced film, with an unusual amount of time being spent ,pre and post ghost attack, on developing his character with family and work life. spoilers discussion/  i especially liked the turning point, when he comes back to the main town and meets with the man helping him and explains about seeing the ghost. he describes the woman in black, and then at the end of the conversation he says that he is going back, because after all, what harm had she done to him? the other man says, ""you can't go back... alone!"" and lends the hero his dog. the cute little dog offers a small respite of comic relief, with it's bounding through the house and even into the locked room.  the many casual appearances of the ghost really freaked me out. the woman shows up in mid shot at the church, showing that it is not afraid of the church, and is also not shy or bound to the house. this is all in the very beginning. another unbelievably memorable scene was with the kids outside of the church fence, watching the funeral. as the camera pans to the right, the woman is seen in the background among the gravestones. the older man won't even look at it, but the kids are all yelling and taunting it. crreeepy... usually ghosts are hidden in shadows, haunting specific locales or people. as has been mentioned, the ghost's malevolence and wrath are frightening, and i feel it's attacks and the ending were perfect and fully justified. the ending underlined the fact that the hero made a major mistake by going back to the house. or perhaps he was marked no matter what, by saving the gypsy girl. the guy who plays the hotel manager is so believable, and really fills the role well. i have been spreading the word to my friends about how much i enjoyed this film, and it is reassuring to see others feel the same. i can see how people don't quite see the same masterpiece, especially if they went into it with a lot of review hype.  i think another person summed it up when they said that this movie settled the question of whether or not ghosts could physically harm man. whew.. i plan to watch it again tonight followed by the changeling, aaww yeah. any other films to recommend?  thanks,",1
"you've gotta hand it to steven seagal: whatever his other faults may be, he does have good taste in women. if you pick a seagal movie, chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it. and usually, they do not function as mere eye candy; they get involved in the action and fight, shoot guns, kill with knives, etc. ""flight of fury"" offers the duo of ciera payton (who has a very sexy face, with luscious lips to match angelina jolie's) and katie jones, and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight and a little lesbian fondling! and if it seems like i'm spending a little too much time talking about them, it's because the rest of the movie, although passable, is so unexciting that it's hard to find much else to talk about. ironically, the weakest aspect is probably seagal himself, who looks as if he can't even be bothered to try to pretend to care. this being a military-type actioner, there is very little fighting in it, and he doesn't fit into his role (a stealth fighter pilot, ""the best in the world"", of course) very well, which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking.

"this is one of my favorite sports movies. dennis quaid is moving and convincing in the part of a man who gave up his dream of being a baseball pitcher when his arm gave out on him. as a high school coach, he challenges his players to win the division championship by telling them he'll try out for a baseball team if they do. they win (partly because of all the batting practice they take with a coach who can pitch over 90 miles an hour), and he keeps his side of the bargain--and is signed!   if you have ever decided to try something new and terrifying as an adult, jim morris's story will resonate with you. it is moving and inspiring, and the man's relationships ring true.   inspiration is not the only reason i rent this one, though. dennis quaid is just downright purdy in the part, and a baseball movie with a good-looking man changing a diaper is my idea of heaven. ladies, if you feel the way i do, check this one out.",1
"what hopkins does succeed at with this effort as writer and director is giving us a sense that we know absolutely no one in the film. however, perhaps therein lies the problem. his movie has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep within, but it's so impersonal. there are no characters. we never know who anyone is, thus there is no investment on our part.  it could be about a screenwriter intermingle with his own characters. is it? maybe. by that i don't mean that slipstream is ambiguous; i mean that there is no telling. hopkins's film is an experiment. on the face of it, one could make the case that it is about a would-be screenwriter, who at the very moment of his meeting with fate, realizes that life is hit and miss, and/or success is blind chance, as he is hurled into a ""slipstream"" of collisions between points in time, dreams, thoughts, and reality. nevertheless, it is so unremittingly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even to the tiny, quite rudimentary extent of allowing us a connection with its characters.  i didn't think the nippy and flamboyant school of shaky, machine-gun-speed camera-work and editing disengaged me, but reflecting upon the film i am beginning to realize that it had a lot to do with it. there are so many movies of the past decade in which the cuts or camera movement have sound effects as well as other atmosphere-deteriorating technical doodads. i suppose in this case it was justified in that its purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. however, i knew barely anything about slipstream when watching it, and i came out the same way. and i just do not care, because hopkins made no effort to make us care. there are interactive movies, and there are movies that sit in a rocking chair and knit, unaware of your presence. slipstream is the latter.",0
"what a complete piece of trash. plot notwithstanding, when a movie's action revolves around airplanes, you'd think the writers/producers/director (or anyone!) would do a little bit of homework as to at least a few of the details. the mistakes were so glaring that i was fuming by the end of the movie. here are just a few: i'm glad i missed the sr-71 sequence - certain to have been worse than the ""air force one"" f-117 spectacle. commercial airlines usually have their logos painted on the aircraft rather than boeing 747  likely the (cheap) use of some boeing advertising/publicity footage by the director. exposed wiring connected by wire nuts is mediocre at best for house wiring, much less multi-million dollar aircraft avionics wiring. airplanes like the 747 rely on pressure alone rather than ship's supply oxygen to maintain breathable air, and if they did rely on an on-board supply, the canister would be far bigger than fist sized. medical tape is not a suitable substitute for a threaded hose connection. those were f-16s, not f-15s. mach 1+ (speed of sound) would be difficult to attain on a static engine run up for takeoff (watch the airspeed indicator). ""standard formation"" is simply keeping the formation inside one nautical mile, ""route"" formation is what they were flying - not the most useful formation for an intercept. ""acquiring missile lock"" is not likely to get an airline pilot's attention - they have no radar detection or countermeasures. ""wait for my signal"" is not inter-flight communication for preparing to fire anything. depressurization from a door opening in flight is not grounds for an immediate steep left bank. yelling into a headset does not make it transmit. magnetic headings are given as ""headings"" not ""bearings,"" and headings are between 001 and 360 degrees (compasses in the air are just like compasses on the ground!), so turning left (not ""port""  that's a boat thing) from a ""bearing"" of 618 to 502 is just stupid. it is in most cases impossible to just ""turn the yoke left until the correct heading is reached""  that sort of thing will result in 360 degree rolls until the yoke is centered again. the likelihood of a flight attendant immediately finding and successfully engaging the autopilot is only slightly greater than the likelihood of her actually landing the jet safely. airplanes don't stall immediately upon pulling the throttle back, and 747s have more than one little lever to control the multi-engine thrust. flaps are lowered in increments usually just prior to and immediately following landing gear extension, not seconds before landing (good way to crash). wheel brakes are required to stop an airplane, simply pulling the throttle(s) (this time a different lever in the movie) to idle will just allow you to go off the end of the runway at a slower speed. did i mention that those fighter aircraft were f-16s and not f-15s? guess i did and that's just what i remember from recently watching this horrific movie.",0
"the documentary revolves around eva mozes kor, a holocaust survivor, part of mengele's experiments on twins, consisting primarily her version of what happened at auschwitz, and a comparison of the emotions of the other survivors of the twin experiments. the movie obviously had great reviews. it's one of those topics that no one dares to voice a contrary opinion about.  i too, for a large part of the movie, got sucked into the emotion that the movie-maker so obviously wanted the viewer to concentrate on. one of the user reviews on imdb by eric monder (obviously having nothing critical to say about the issue on a public forum) could only find the sweetest nectar. ""in one of the many dramatic sequences, as a group of jews argue with kor at a jewish center, the meaning of the word ""forgive"" is even debated, but the isolated and outnumbered kor holds her own"" but by this time, the sappy hold that the movie had on my dormant emotional repertoire had let loose enough that i could see clearly once more. after the ""strong-willed"" eva kor forgives her ""nazi captors"" the movie begins to delve into what forgiving is all about, at least from the viewpoint of kor. the movie goes about following her, past her public statement forgiving the nazis and into new territory. to me, this was the meat of the movie, surrounded by inedible fat of her ""act of forgiveness"". obviously, it was a very sick cow.  on a mission to test her theory of forgiveness, in order to heal wounds of the past, she makes her way to the ""promised land"" to meet with some arabs, to discuss with them the issues that they face and to see if dialogue cannot lead to a better understanding of the situation and heavily interspersed with debates and discussions with jews in the us on her act of forgiving the nazis, including one at a jewish center in chicago. from then on, anyone not so teary eyed that they can't see the screen will find it hard-pressed to miss the obvious contradiction in her statements.  firstly, you immediately notice her body language, defensive and unwilling to listen in a room full of arab scholars and teachers. her comments about how she feared that they might kidnap her shows how much of a waste of time, effort and money the entire act was. a rather annoyed dr sami advan (professor of education at bethlehem university) gets it just right when he tells kor off for a statement she makes about how she would rather be asleep in her apartment.  finally, the debate at the jewish center in chicago, where she is ""grilled"" on the meaning of forgiveness and her right to do so, in the wake of those that continue suffering through the trauma of the acts.  i will cut to the chase. by the end of the movie, i was hoping i hadn't chosen to watch the movie. the movie was badly made, failing to delve deeper into anything about auschwitz apart from the purely trivial, just sufficient to make sure the holocaust is refreshed in the viewers memory and to incite a barrage of tears. it showed that kor, the subject of the documentary was unable to engage in fair discussion. her discussion abilities were limited to parroting her stance on forgiveness (at best) to a complete unwillingness to listen or participate.  lastly, is everyone so retarded today that they can't notice the difference between making peace and forgiving? quoting another imdb user, ""i don't see her forgiveness as being weak- quite the contrary, she just wanted to relieve its hold from her soul, she wanted the suffering to be over, so she let it go."" that would be the perfect layman's definition of making peace.  i guess, in a world of propaganda, blind faith and political correctness, there is no room to question those that have ""gone through more than the human mind can fathom"".  p.s. the dictionary certainly should go into all those books-to-buy lists everyone keeps making.",0
"this was a disappointing film. the people seem to have no substance, the lead protagonist martin cahil has zero redemptive values, in fact everyone in it including jon voight epitomizes sleeze. i would not recommend this film to anyone. the violence is distasteful, though artfully done. the filming is to black, at least the print i saw fit this category. a disappointment.",0

"  i'm sure things didn't exactly go the same way in the real life of homer hickam as they did in the film adaptation of his book, rocket boys, but the movie ""october sky"" (an anagram of the book's title) is good enough to stand alone. i have not read hickam's memoirs, but i am still able to enjoy and understand their film adaptation. the film, directed by joe johnston and written by lewis colick, records the story of teenager homer hickam (jake gyllenhaal), beginning in october of 1957. it opens with the sound of a radio broadcast, bringing news of the russian satellite sputnik, the first artificial satellite in orbit. we see a images of a blue-gray town and its people: mostly miners working for the olga coal company. one of the miners listens to the news on a hand-held radio as he enters the elevator shaft, but the signal is lost as he disappears into the darkness, losing sight of the starry sky above him. a melancholy violin tune fades with this image. we then get a jolt of elvis on a car radio as words on the screen inform us of the setting: october 5, 1957, coalwood, west virginia. homer and his buddies, roy lee cook (william lee scott) and sherman o'dell (chad lindberg), are talking about football tryouts. football scholarships are the only way out of the town, and working in the mines, for these boys. ""why are the jocks the only ones who get to go to college,"" questions homer. roy lee replies, ""they're also the only ones who get the girls."" homer doesn't make it in football like his older brother, so he is destined for the mines, and to follow in his father's footsteps as mine foreman. until he sees the dot of light streaking across the october sky. then he wants to build a rocket. ""i want to go into space,"" says homer. after a disastrous attempt involving a primitive rocket and his mother's (natalie canerday) fence, homer enlists the help of the nerdy quentin wilson (chris owen). quentin asks homer, ""what do you want to know about rockets?"" homer quickly anwers, ""everything."" his science teacher at big creek high school, miss frieda riley (laura dern) greatly supports homer, and the four boys work on building rockets in homer's basement. his father, however, whose life is the mine, does not support him. john hickam (chris cooper) believes that homer shouldn't waste his time on the rockets, that the coal mines are all that matter. the coal from the mines is used to make steel, and without steel, the country would be nothing. the difficult relationship between homer and his dad is one of the most poignant relationships i have ever seen in a film. miss riley introduces homer to the idea of entering the local science fair, with a chance to go the nationals and win a college scholarship. ""you can't just dream your way out of coalwood,"" she tells homer. homer and his friends act upon their dreams by working constantly on the rockets, improving the models with each attempt. despite the many attempts, the boys do not lose their determination. ""what are the chances of us winning that science fair,"" o'dell asks homer in one of their more despairing moments. ""a million to one,"" answers homer. ""that good?"" o'dell replies, ""well, why didn't you say so?"" the music, composed by mark isham, conveys sadness and hope at the same time, especially sad at a point when homer descends into the mine shaft and loses sight of the sky and his dreams of getting out of coalwood. rollicking 1950s' rock and roll, including songs by the coasters and buddy holly, occasionally pushes the instrumental pieces aside to create a light-hearted mood that contrasts the teenagers' lives with the lives of the miners. the film, photographed by fred murphy, also uses colors to set moods and symbolize. the town of coalwood, actually filmed in tennessee, is washed with blues, grays, and browns. it's as if the grime from the coal sticks to everything- faces, clothes, houses, and roads. when a couple in a gleaming red convertible stops to ask for directions from the boys, it is obvious that they are from the world outside of coalwood and the olga coal company. the book on guided missile design that miss riley gives homer is red. the red stands out enough against the blue-gray world of coalwood to symbolize ""getting out"", but it is still subtle. the reds are fleeting hints of a world that homer only dreams of. jake gyllenhaal expresses such zeal, hope, and pertinacity as homer hickam that it is hard to believe he isn't the real homer we see in actual footage at the end of the film. chris cooper is also extraordinarily believable as homer's stubborn father, who doesn't recognize, or just doesn't want to admit, that the mine is not producing enough to keep the town alive. homer, and everyone who encourages him in his rocket-building, is aware that the town is dying. with the community disintegrating, the only way they stay together is by gathering for the rocket boys' demonstrations. again, i'm sure things didn't happen exactly as the movie portrayed them, but what would a movie be without a bit of idealism? ""october sky"" has just enough of that to make it a great motion picture and enough rawness to keep it real.",1
"this is just about in the same league as `the black cat', although i'd give this a 9 rather than a 9+. that's praise indeed for a film that has been so badly underrated that it is amazing!  `the invisible ray' is part horror, part drama and certainly part sci-fi. for a movie made in 1936 the sci-fi elements were a good deal ahead of their time. the mixture of horror, drama and sci-fi are a perfect blend, while the acting on the part of lugosi and karloff couldn't be better.  director lambert hillyer captures a lot of elements that james whale did so often. what i'm saying is that this film is eerie and well shot. the scene with the gargoyles outside of lugosi's room is a perfect example of the mood. it's a standout moment in the film, which is so sadly missing in today's movies of the genre.  as with `the black cat' and `island of lost souls', i can't understand why this film has yet to be released on dvd. when you consider some of the junk that's already been transferred to dvd it's that much more puzzling.  anyway, watch this film if you get the chance. when it's released on dvd grab it fast and put it in an honored spot within your dvd library.",1
"i would have liked to give this movie a zero but that wasn't an option!! this movie sucks!!! the women cannot act. i should have known it was gonna suck when i saw bobby brown. nobody in my house could believe i hadn't changed the channel after the first 15 minutes. the idea of black females as gunslingers in the western days is ridiculous. it's not just a race thing, it's also a gender. the combination of the two things is ridiculous.i am sorry because some of the people in the movie aren't bad actors/actresses but the movie itself was awful. it was not credible as a movie. it might be 'entertaining' to a certain group of people but i am not in that group. lol. and using a great line from a great, great movie...""that's all i have to say about that.""",0
i love this film. it's one of those i can watch again and again. it is acted well by a good cast that doesn't try too hard to be star studded.  the premise of a newly widowed housewife who turns to selling pot to make ends meet could have been made into an americanised turd of a movie or an action thriller. either would have killed the film completely.  the film plays out like an ealing comedy with a terrific feel-good factor throughout.  it is worth watching just for the scene with the two old ladies and a box of cornflakes... (no that's not a spoiler!),1
"first of all i need to say that i'm portuguese and it's not usual to me spend my time watching portuguese movies, probably one each year or even none...  ...and the reason is the almost generalized idea between the portuguese people that the national pictures are awful, really close to the worst ever made! however, in the last decade, it starts to surprises me when we get back the funny of the 40s when ""leão da estrela"" e ""costa do castelo"" were among the worlds best of their time, with movies like ""pulsação zero"" or ""sorte nula"", both from director fernando fragata and also with some actors and music in common.  this one is also good, not of the same kind because it isn't a true comedy; in fact it's officially a drama, a woman's drama the has some unexpected funny parts, cause of humorous characters or hilarious things that happen to them, like the hypothetical travel to the caribbean just to get laid.   the plot works and can surprise us a few times; the actors are fine, the locations regular as the score; but the truth is that it all make sense, then we can count it as a nice effort for the national cinema, that seems to be starting from the ashes as the phoenix.  if you want to watch a portuguese movie, surely you can take better option, but it stills one to be measured.",1
"this columbo episode is probably noted more for the director, steven spielberg, as one of his early films. it should be looked at for jack cassidy's role as the murderer who kills his partner in writing to maintain his lifestyle. jack cassidy would appear in a later columbo. after all, columbo meets his match in jack cassidy's character. he is a mystery writer who plots to perform the perfect murder. after his first murder, his next victim would be the annoying general store owner/widow who would blackmail him for money. rather than losing more money, he kills her. it is very entertaining to watch cassidy and falk as always. falk's familiarity as columbo makes him watchable after viewing this episode repeatedly over the years. what television today forgets about the success of years is that people will want to watch the shows again and again if they like the characters. it's not about who does it, how and why, it the familiarness of columbo and his likability which scores high with viewers like myself.",1
"this film was hard to get a hold of, and when i eventually saw it the disappointment was overwhelming. i mean, this is one of the great stories of the twentieth century: an unknown man takes advantage of the unsuspecting airline industry and gets away with millions in ransom without hurting anyone or bungling the attempt. with all of this built-in interest, how could anyone make such a lackluster, talk-laden flick of this true-life event. while williams is always interesting, the screenwriters assumed that the d.b. cooper persona was stereotypically heroic like a movie star, s what we get is a type-without any engaging details or insights into the mind of a person daring enough and clever enough to have pulled it off. harrold practically steals the movie with her spunk and pure beauty, but the real letdown was in the handling of the plot and the lame direction. shame on this film for even existing.",0
"there is not a speck of entertainment in this entire film. there's not one scary, funny, or even interesting scene in this film. it advertises itself as a horror, then goes on to call itself a comedy. it doesn't even attempt humor. neither does it attempt to be scary.  in order to not be bored by this film, you would have to be one of the most easily entertained people on earth. if you like this movie even a little bit than you have no standard for what you watch at all. i'm having a very difficult time trying to understand what the filmmakers were trying to accomplish with this. its not funny, scary, shocking, or intriguing. so was it supposed to be a drama? because it really wasn't dramatic either.  please just do yourself a favor and don't watch this film. life is too precious to be wasting 90 minutes of it watching this.",0

"spoilers  wow, end of the world is a singularly underwhelming cinematic experience.  here is the full story: a scientist is getting messages from space (a la independence day). the messages say stuff like a massive disaster is about to happen and then the scientist hears later on the radio that a huge earthquake just happened in china. he starts thinking that the messages have something to do with the disasters around the world so he's trying to figure out who's receiving the messages (and who's also sending out messages in space). he and his wife eventually figure out that the messages come from a convent. they visit it. everything looks normal, including the priest played by a bored christopher lee. but the scientist is adamant and really believes that the messages are coming from and going to that convent. so he and his wife secretly go back to the convent where they are caught snooping around by the aliens, disguised as priests and nuns. they are held against their will and the alien played by lee forces the scientist to get something they need in order for them to return to their planet. once the alien get the special element, the aliens all depart one by one to their home planet in some sort of tacky looking transporter platform. lee, being the last alien left, tells the couple that the earth will be destroyed because of some sort of hokey decision by the aliens. lee walks in the transporter and he's gone. the couple, looking at the monitors that show stock footage of natural disasters occurring all over the world, decide to follow the aliens. because earth is doomed, the couple doesn't see any point of staying behind so they walk in the transporter and disappear. the last shot of the movie is a papier mache planet earth exploding. the end.  that's it.   i've never seen such a dull movie in my life. it's the most underwhelming movie i've ever experienced. the scientist and his wife are two of worst heroes or protagonists ever put on screen. they don't care about anything. they see the earth disasters on the monitors and decide ""what the heck, who needs earth anyway?"" they don't even try to stop them or do something to make things better. this kind of story might have worked if the film had an overwhelming sense of doom to everything but the action and atmosphere are nonexistent. the actors and the folks behind this dull flick are going through their paces, so much so that you can almost feel when they punched their cards when they got off and returned to work. i wasn't expecting much with this movie because it is a charles band production, but i didn't expect it to be this bad.  christopher lee was once asked what was his worst film he ever made and he mentioned starship invasions. well, i'm sorry chris but starship invasions was actually goofy fun. starship invasions is terrible but terribly entertaining. end of the world is much, much, much worst: it's beyond dull and inert, with no entertainment value whatsoever.",0

"i agree with many of the negative reviews posted here, for reasons i will go into later on. but this miniseries is powerful and convincing because the talented cast really captures the dark truth of hitler's world.  peter stormare is perfect as ernst rohm, the brutal brownshirt leader. each scene he has with hitler is explosive! hitler is so evil he dominates everyone but the thuggish, primitive rohm -- and he clearly digs rohm for just that reason. the interplay between stormare and carlisle illuminates the way hitler relished rohm's brutality, but later sacrificed him for political reasons.  jena malone turns in a heartrending performance as geli raubal, hitler's doomed niece and the victim of his unspeakable perversions. without revealing any of the sexual filth directly, jena malone plays out all the horror of the slow extinction of a young girl's spirit. she uses her eyes and voice to suggest all the horror that will be visited on millions in the years to come. and she's brilliant! zoe telford very nearly matches jena malone with her portrayal of eva braun. eva is clearly sick, cruel and heartless -- but at the same time almost pitiably dependent on her adolph's twisted tenderness. the aborted lovemaking scene between them (hinting at the spine tingling truth of hitler's enormous self-loathing) is both chilling and erotic.  liev schrieber gives a deliciously weasel-like performance as putzi hanfstaengel, the spineless man-about-town who is seduced by hitler's promises of wealth and power. while a brute like rohm simply loves the idea of crushing skulls under his boots, schrieber's character is one of many germans who abhors nazi violence but can't resist the quick and easy route to money and power. his weak-willed fawning over hitler soon loses him the respect of his wife, played with style and sensuality by the stunning and regal julianna margulies. they provide a true portrait of marriage and betrayal.  these performances carry the mini series along, easily overcoming occasional weaknesses in the script. there is one exception. regrettably, matthew modine's acting chops just aren't up to snuff. his noble lunk-haid journalist ruins every scene he has -- the viewer can hardly wait for rohm's brown-shirts to stomp that smug, righteous look off his ignorant, corn-pone low-rent hollywood golden boy face. but the story still works.  now in regard to the factual inaccuracies of the script -- hitler's perversions and cruelty are rendered in a vibrant, compelling drama. but the battlefield record of corporal hitler is badly distorted. as if afraid the audience can't handle the idea of evil and courage in the same person, the writers make hitler look like a whining coward who ""begged"" for an iron cross. as if anyone in the kaiser's army could get a medal just by whining about it! the movie makes it look as if hitler were a coward in the trenches, when he was a fearless soldier. they also suggest his comrades despised him, when in reality he was widely admired by officers and enlisted men alike. the depressing thing is that the mini-series succeeds so well in representing hitler as a monster in honest ways -- but they just couldn't resist the cheap shot.  all in all, however, hitler: rise of evil is a soaring success highlighted by powerful performances.",1

""flower of flesh and blood"" is a more violent and gory depiction of fake ""snuff"" material, but that film also falls flat on the realism level. i applaud the japanese for pushing the boundaries, and they've really come a long way over the past 2 decades to wear the crown in ""extreme"" film-making, but ""devil's experiment"" just doesn't hold up. worth a look if you are a die-hard, if for no other reason than to see what the fuss is about, but i can only give this film an extremely generous 3/10 and that's only for the needle-through-the-eye scene...",0

"french horror cinema has seen something of a revival over the last couple of years with great films such as inside and switchblade romance bursting on to the scene. maléfique preceded the revival just slightly, but stands head and shoulders over most modern horror titles and is surely one of the best french horror films ever made! maléfique was obviously shot on a low budget, but this is made up for in far more ways than one by the originality of the film, and this in turn is complimented by the excellent writing and acting that ensure the film is a winner. the plot focuses on two main ideas; prison and black magic. the central character is a man named carrère, sent to prison for fraud. he is put in a cell with three others; the quietly insane lassalle, body building transvestite marcus and his retarded boyfriend daisy. after a short while in the cell together, they stumble upon a hiding place in the wall that contains an old journal. after translating part of it, they soon realise its magical powers and realise they may be able to use it to break through the prison walls.  black magic is a very interesting topic, and i'm actually quite surprised that there aren't more films based on it as there's so much scope for things to do with it. it's fair to say that maléfique makes the best of it's assets as despite it's restraints, the film never actually feels restrained and manages to flow well throughout. director eric valette provides a great atmosphere for the film; the fact that most of it takes place inside the central prison cell ensures that the film feels very claustrophobic, and this immensely benefits the central idea of the prisoners wanting to use magic to break out of the cell - it's very easy to get behind them! it's often said that the unknown is the thing that really frightens people, and this film proves that as the director ensures that we can never really be sure of exactly what is round the corner, and this helps to ensure that maléfique actually does manage to be quite frightening! the film is memorable for a lot of reasons outside the central plot; the characters are all very interesting in their own way and the fact that the book itself almost takes on its own character is very well done. anyone worried that the film won't deliver by the end won't be disappointed either as the ending both makes sense and manages to be quite horrifying! overall, maléfique is a truly great horror film and one of the best of the decade - highly recommended viewing!",1
"this is the touching story of two families in israel and the relationships within each family. each family has a gay son. the stories are interrelated at that point but this film is about all of the family members, not just the two sons. the portraits of each of the family members in both families are well drawn and the story is consistently interesting if a bit bleak.",1

"do not see this movie if you value your mind. at the end of our collective viewing, me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5% of our brains during its course. the only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designer.  most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth. i realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion, this movie has bred a deep hatred within me. i hate this movie so very, very much.  some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously. if only it didn't take itself seriously. but it does. the plot is a warmed over version of blade runner-esque universe melded with the cheap rubber suits so prevalent in bad dinosaur movies. the dialogue is not only puerile and meaningless but often literally painful. whoopee goldberg isn't even trying, but george newbern as the voice of theodore rex is like fingernails on the soul. and whether its juliet landua with her off again on again british accent or richard roundtree (aka shaft) as the blustering commissioner, you will sink into an ever increasing sense of incredulity and disillusionment.  i recommend this movie only to anyone who wishes to see the depths of stupidity to which mankind may fall.",0
"the first 30 minutes of tinseltown had my finger teetering on the remote, poised to flick around to watch something else. the premise of two writers, down on their luck, living in a self-storage-space ""bin"" was mildly amusing, but, painfully bland.  the introduction of the character, played by joe pantoliano - the big deal movie guy, that lives in the park and sleeps in a lavatory, offered hope and i decided to give it a few more minutes. and then a few more until kristy swansons introduction as a budding film director & borderline nymphomaniac, added a bit of spice. her solid acting performance raised her presence above and beyond just a very welcome eye-candy inclusion.  ultimately, the obvious low-budget impacts on the film with poorly shot scenes, stuttured pace and slapstick handling of certain moments. some of my favourite movies of all time have been low budget, whithnail & i being one that also deals with 2 guys with a dream, but down on their luck.  however, for my money, the actors save tinseltown from the ""terrible movie"" archives and just about nudges it into the ""could have been a cult movie"" archives. i laughed out loud at some of the scenes involving joe pantoliano's character. in particular, the penultimate scenes in the terribly clichéd, but still funny, rich-but-screwed-up characters house, where the story unravels towards it's final moments.  i can see how tinseltown was a great stage play and while the film-makers did their best to translate this to celluloid, it simply didn't work and while i laughed out loud at some of scenes and one liners, i think the first 30 minutes dulled my senses and expectations to such a degree i would have laughed at anything.  unless you're stuck for a novelty coffee coaster, don't pick this up if you see it in a bargain bucket.",0
"the ballad of django is a meandering mess of a movie! this spaghetti western is simply a collection of scenes from other (and much better!) films supposedly tied together by ""django"" telling how he brought in different outlaws. hunt powers (john cameron) brings nothing to the role of django. skip this one unless you just have to have every django movie made and even that may not be a good enough excuse to see this one!!",0
"what a waste of time and money! my hubby and i saw this movie - after seeing the previews and thinking it ""might be funny"". wrong! this movie is about 90 minutes too long. the actors are trapped in a poorly written script and can't get out. the jokes are weak and tired, and not even seeing wilson's naked behind can redeem any part of this film. the special effects.....aren't. i half expected to see the harness and wires holding up uma in her flying scenes. and when the effects people apparently could not master the superhero's faster-than-a-speeding-bullet flying or fight scenes, they covered over everything with a swirling vortex of blurred screen - which hid the awful effects quite nicely. wilson's sidekick was a lame excuse for a man and wilson had no chemistry with either uma or his office co-worker. the sex scenes weren't sexy and the funny scenes weren't funny. i guess i just expected too much from these actors. none of the characters were really sympathetic, so i ended up not caring a flying fig about any of them. the only memorable performances were the kids who played bedlam and g-girl as teenagers - at least they had some chemistry. overall, a super stinko movie - i wouldn't even recommend it as a rental - it would still be a waste of money!",0
"only a handful of the segments are engaging here. a segment with a garage attendant from nigeria is heartbreaking. one with fanny ardent & bob hoskins makes its point, twist by twist until the final shot overplays things.   the problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke paris. the others are so scatter-shot in theme, tone, volition & production that you may as well be watching ""the years best commercials, 2006."" it's really all over the place. it doesn't develop over it's running time, and nothing reigns the directors in. no construct successfully joins the pieces... tedium sets in. i'm at the one hour, twenty minute point and elijah wood is in some dumb, over-commercial, overproduced vampire shtick. it has about as much to do with paris as old ladies knitting in the antartic. fantasy shows up i think first in the coen brothers segment (uh, thanks j & e for ruining another movie) and then makes way too many appearances. the point of being in paris is that you don't need make-believe crap to make your days extraordinary. why divide it by neighborhood if quartier de la madeleine is equated with vampires for some loser director? has there ever been a genre more over-represented than the vampire film. every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés.  making things worse is that the switch from segment to segment is pretty artless. the transitions get lost. this doesn't feel intentional, it feels sloppy.",0
"no words can describe my utter hatred for this appalling rendition of the btk killer. rating this film one out of ten compliments this truly disastrous excuse for a film. from start to finish, there was not one single highlight. the entire thing was horrendously put together; the script, acting, plot, lighting, direction, acting, factual information, acting, just to name a few. a number of scenes are literally laugh-out-loud-funny, for the atrocious way in which the entire thing is put together. this review may seem like an unjust and scathing attack on a low-budget film, but this is not the case. just thinking about the movie i have just seen makes my blood start to boil. how this film was ever granted rights for production i will never know. i am almost tempted to actually recommend btk, because it is truly a stand-out in regards to how pathetic, and disturbingly awful it is. i can honestly say, in all my years of film-going, this is the worst. movie. ever. i wasted over an hour of my life on this useless garbage, and would gladly have jumped off the nearest building beforehand, had i known what i was in for. zero out of ten.",0
"the clichéd polynesian males drink, fight and make a stream of sexist, stupid and unfunny remarks. real life polynesians are much funnier than these stereotyped, cardboard characters. the supposedly samoan girl didn't look or act samoan at all, seemed more like the stock white female who has sex with anyone on a whim. with weak as water story lines you can't say anything about the acting - even the most brilliant actors could do nothing with this script. it's sad to see polynesian actors willing to play such sad stereotypes in a film with not one good scene, and only two or three 'jokes'. what a waste of kiwi taxpayers' money, what a lost opportunity to make a great film about a vibrant community. it's better not to make movies if they're as bad and mindless as this.",0
"i can sum this movie up using 20 words or less. way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face. see, 19 words, however, i didn't completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that julie bowen is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the dvd right out from the machine and blowing it up with an m80. my advice, take the $4.00 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having to sit through this train wreck, or you may want to send me the $50.00 replacement fee you would have been charged from taking out your twelve gage to use this piece of garbage as skeet shooting practice.",0

"yikes, it was definitely one of those sleepless nights where i surfed the channels and bumped into this stinker of a movie. for some of the names in the cast, i'd expect a much better movie. i'm almost embarrassed to see oscar winner f. murray abraham being reduced to such a horrible part. i hope the money was worth it. and the students, they talked about fencing like they were talking about survival in a war or through a horrible disaster. i mean, i've fenced, it's a fun sport, but i've never been that intense. the only reason i even watched this entire movie was because the remote fell under the sofa and i was too lazy to get it back.",0
"i watched 3/4 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here. it was fairly easy to watch (at 3am). it had good casting - kevin dillon's role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable - he was both charasmatic and chilling. the rest of the main characters weren't so bad either.  this is your typical stalker/suspense movie. a married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help. a sociopathic ""genetic material"" donor fixates on the recipients and, in typical stalker form, intrudes into their lives.  as i said, most of the movie was fairly good.. we see ""conan"" grow more and more obsessed in raising his baby and creating the perfect family with the mother. of course things don't work out for him the way he planned. not a bad plot line.  but, the last 15 minutes were just horrible. i am pretty tolerant with movies (especially at 3am!).. but, i was just amazed at how bad the ending was written. i actually scoffed outloud!  all in all, not the worst movie i've seen, but i wouldn't be able to sit through it again (unless i skipped the ending). the only redeaming quality here was kevin dillon's role - - one of the best serial killers ever.  try looking around at the other channels before watching this.. but, if nothing better is on, i'd give it a try.. =)",0
"a few weeks ago, i read the classic george orwell novel, 1984. i was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books i've read recently. so when i rented the dvd, i was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up. unfortunately, the movie didn't even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that orwell so masterfully did in his book. the director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book, because he makes no attempt to demonstrate why the characters act and feel the way they do. john hurt, the main actor, is droll the entire way through, and hardly does any acting until the end. we never really find out what he does for a living, or why his love affair is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion. this book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters, and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film. besides that, john hurt was a terrible casting choice, looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old winston he was supposed to be portraying. on a more positive note, however, the rest of the cast was well chosen. it's just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor. -brian o.",0

"don't get me wrong, the movie is beautiful, the shots are stunning, and the material is dramatic. however, it was a big disappointment and i actually left very angry at what disney had done.  bbc's planet earth was all of the above and more. it was subtle. it had an overall feeling of balance and showed the full circle of life and death. there was tragedy and triumph, loss and gain. it was balanced.  disney's edit of earth is none of this. they tried to make it a movie us americans would talk about. they made it dramatic. they put an over the top musical score there to frighten us. they made predators evil. they made walruses evil. they showed every encounter as negative. it tried to be suspenseful and succeeded, but at the expense of the lesson of balance. the movie was an hour and a half of negative portrayal and only about 10 minutes of positive.  i am all for preventing global warning, but this was over the top political and environmental junk.  that's another thing, i went to see it on the big screen, but was disappointed in the picture quality. it looked better on my tv at home.  if you want to see something like this and get the whole picture, go out and buy, rent, or borrow the bbc's planet earth series. it is better lessons, better sound, and (if you have blu-ray)better picture quality.",0

"i love it when they actually do a sports story well. so many in the past have been so hokey it was embarrassing to watch. not this one. it's just a genuinely nice movie, an old-fashioned type of story - and based on a real-life guy to did exactly what dennis quaid did in this film. he plays a high school coach who is talked into trying out, late in life athletically-speaking, to become a pitcher in professional baseball. eventually, he reaches his goal of making it to the major leagues, even if it was a very brief stint.  all the characters in here are nice people, the kind you root for, from quaid to the players on his high school team, to his little boy (angus t. jones, now somewhat of a star on television.)  quaid is believable in playing jim morris because, unlike actors in the past in sports films, he knows how to throw a baseball. he looks like a pitcher, a guy who could fire it 90-plus miles per hour. and, most of this film is true, as testified by the real-life pitcher in one the documentaries on the dvd.  so, if you're looking for a nice, inspirational true life sports film, you can't wrong with this one.",1
"up until the sixth and last episode of the star wars saga, which finally ended in 2005, i had always looked at this 1983 entry as my favorite film of the long-running series. the varied action scenes and really different characters (jabba the hut, furry woodland creatures, etc.) made this a particularly appealing movie.  none of the action ever focused too long in one spot, either. the last half hour exemplifies this the most as the scene switches every few minutes from the woods to the battle among space ships to the individual laser-duel between luke skywalker and darth vader.  another nice characteristic this film had that the two previous did not was the absence of in-fighting between two of the stars. gone was the incessant bickering between carrie fisher and harrison ford. finally, everyone was on the same page! it was nice to see.  in the end, this was simply a wonderful adventure tale, more than anything else.",1

"edwin porter's 1903 short film entitled ""the great train robbery"" bursts onto the screen with so much excitement and ingenuity that one prepares to be blown away by another pioneering early film. just like melies' ""a trip to the moon"", critics have hailed this as being the film that introduced the western genre into modern cinema. in my eyes, they were right. it had everything from the planning, the actual heist of the train, the murder of an unwanted civilian, and that looming final scene that makes you realize that these villains mean business  it was all monumental for its time. from here to eastwood, every western filmmaker has used porter's image in some form or another to create their own story. one cannot say that this film didn't open the door, but the struggle comes from the story itself. the genre was defined by porter, but outside of its initial excitement  there really isn't anything to grapple onto. perhaps i am jaded by the cliché modern westerns and their haphazard messages, but how can something be cliché before being cliché? to me, ""the great train robbery"" seemed forced, untraceable, and unsurprising.  unlike melies, porter tells a very linear story. robbers change the course of a train, rob it, then shoot at random people just to prove they are the true villains, and the final scene ends like any predestined film, without any surprises or glitches, and that looming man with a gun to your proverbial face. it is bland. porter's film is boring. in the edition i watched, there was an addition of color near to the end to emphasize emotion, which felt cheap and was not encouraging to the filmmaker, or to the viewer. the issue remains that while it is important, porter's film has been borrowed time and time again, it has in effect become diluted. the story itself does not carry the emotional powerhouse it once has. unlike melies early film, i cannot watch this again. i know what has happened, i know there is very little missing from behind the scenes, and that finally it is just what it has set out to be  a simple story leading from point a to point b to point c. this issue is not only my gripe with this film, but also the strongest element to see in such an early film. while it was dull, the fact that it told such a strong narrative  that our characters were characters with motives and drives, was outstanding to see. in an era where nonfiction films seemed mainstream, this broke the mold. again, not that i am jumping on the prophetic bandwagon about this film  it is an important film  it just isn't a great film.  overall, i was eager to jump into this film to see where the roots of the western genre were planted, but i was equally as happy to leave this film behind. porter is a talented director, and g.m. anderson obviously went on to be very successful in the created field, but i just wasn't in awe of the film. i wasn't expecting big budget effects like melies work, nor was i expecting a duplicate of ""a trip to the moon"", but i did want to see the same creativity, exploration, and originality. i felt porter played it safe, if that can be said with such an early film, but i couldn't feel the excitement as our villains did their evil deeds. i wasn't rooting for anyone, and the final conclusion proved that the kitschy-ness of it had worn off minutes after the film started. it was pioneering, but not monumental. ""the great train robbery"" has lost its space in the time capsule of cinema.  grade: ** out of *****",0
"few movies have dashed expectations and upset me as much as fire has. the movie is pretentious garbage. it does not achieve anything at an artistic level. the only thing it managed to receive is a ban in india. if only it was because of the poor quality of film making rather than the topical controversy, the ban would have been more justifiable.  now that i've got my distress out of my system, i am more able to analyse the movie:   * from the onset the movie feels unreal especially when the protagonists start conversing in english. the director, of course, did not make the movie for an indian audience; however it underestimated its international audiences by over simplifying it. watching the character of the domestic help conversing in perfect english is too unreal to be true.  * next we get regular glimpses into radha's dreams. these scenes are not very effective. they coming up as jarring and obstruct the flow of the movie. i'm still wondering how that philosophical dialogue connected to the story. i felt that the surrealism was lost.  * the love scenes felt voyeuristic and are probably meant for audience titillation rather than being a powerful statement. in any case, they do not achieve either of the two.  * the names chosen for the women, radha and sita, are names of hindu deities and hence been selected to shock the audiences. however, since the film wasn't meant for indian audiences in the first place, the shock-through-name-selection is not meant to achieve its goal, which is absurd.  * the quality of direction is very poor and some key and delicate scenes have been poorly handled. a better director could have made a powerful emotional drama out of the subject.  * the acting felt wooden although nandita das brought some life into the role, the others were wasted. i always thought that shabana azmi was a good actress but her talent is not evident in this film. the male leads were outright rubbish.  in case you are a fan of earth and wish to see more of the director, stay away from this one. please.",0
"until now, the worst movie i had ever seen was ben & arthur. you really should check the reviews for that movie instead of this one. the review statistics for this movie have been skewed positive through a relentless and unscrupulous push by some of the people involved in making it, evidence for which is fairly easy to uncover online. at least the people who made ben & arthur were honorable enough to let it stand on its own shaky legs, instead of unscrupulously promoting it so suckers like me would buy it.  everything about this movie is terrible, the script, the story, the casting, the acting, the direction, the photography, the editing, the music... what else goes into a movie? whatever it is, here it's as bad as it gets. if it weren't so unpleasant it would be ridiculous. i kept watching it thinking it must get better, because i hadn't yet discovered that none of the positive reviews for it are reliable.  it does not take a lot of money to make a great movie, nor does a low budget mean a movie has to be bad. my favorite example of a shoestring-budget masterpiece is gus van sant's amazing mala noche, but there are many others. sideline secretsdirector's cut or originalis bad not because the people who made it had no money, but because they had gigantic egos and no talent for anything at all except self-promotion.",0

i had to compare two versions of hamlet for my shakespeare class and unfortunately i picked this version. everything from the acting (the actors deliver most of their lines directly to the camera) to the camera shots (all medium or close up shots...no scenery shots and very little back ground in the shots) were absolutely terrible. i watched this over my spring break and it is very safe to say that i feel that i was gypped out of 114 minutes of my vacation. not recommended by any stretch of the imagination.,0
"henry fool is a better film. but this is the perfect way to follow-up a film like 'henry fool.' to take henry very seriously, his 'lies' and his mysterious aura. even the opening shot of 'henry fool' when simon puts his ear to the ground as henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through 'fay grim.' the over-the-top jokes, that are more or less meta-jokes (about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves), are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them. also hartley's use of dutch angles throughout the film is jarring, yes, it's intention, but it feels forced and over-used, it goes beyond jarring to, what i'd like to call, annoying. it's a flawed film, but a must see for any hartley or 'henry fool' fan.   and don't listen to stupid reviews, don't watch this unless you've seen the first film. the intrigue, satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you haven't seen henry fool. it's a sequel. that's just dumb.",1
"a river runs through it is based on the true story of two fly fishing brothers, norman and paul, (brad pitt and craig sheffer) whose reverend father (tom skerritt) is a strict man whose two passions are his faith and fly fishing, - and, for him and his sons, there is a fine line between the two. this story describes the slow progression of the brothers' lives and how their lives separate on two different paths. it is a touching movie narrated by the director, robert redford, playing the elderly norman and reflecting on times long gone and people long dead.  certain themes recur in the movie, such as memory, death, eternity, and dreams. most of these themes revolve around the almost tragic hero of paul. he is a capable, charming, and brave man, but has his fatal flaws.  the closing lines sum up the ""point"" of the movie: ""then in the arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the big blackfoot river and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. the river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. on some of those rocks are timeless raindrops. under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs. i am haunted by waters.""",1

"the only reason i saw ""shakedown"" was that it has erika eleniak in it. she's sexy as always, but she plays second fiddle to leading man wolf larson. it's a pity, because she has more action capabilities than she's allowed to show here. the film largely consists of endless shootouts that quickly become monotonous - especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing larson and him armed only with a revolver (that never runs out of bullets) taking them all out rather easily. the earthquake effects are decent, but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poor cgi explosions. as the psychotic ""spiritual leader"", ron perlman tries, but the pseudo-religious mumbo-jumbo he has to spout is simply boring. eleniak, perlman or larson (assuming he has any) completists might want to give this one a look, for others it is barely worth a rental.

"this is a very light headed comedy about a wonderful family that has a son called pecker because he use to peck at his food. pecker loves to take all kinds of pictures of the people in a small suburb of baltimore, md., and manages to get the attention of a group of photo art lovers from new york city. pecker has a cute sister who goes simply nuts over sugar and is actually an addict, taking spoonfuls of sugar from a bag. there are scenes of men showing off the lumps in their jockey's with grinding movements and gals doing pretty much the same. it is rather hard to keep your mind out of the gutter with this film, but who cares, it is only a film to give you a few laughs at a simple picture made in 1998.",1
"a comparison between this movie and 'the last detail' is made by some, but 'chasers' is flatter than a stretch of interstate highway in west texas. and like the scenery in the desert, there's nothing much to distinguish it, not even the fact that a female prisoner is being transported by two navy escorts this time around. no one in the cast comes off too well; with this lame script that's not surprising. dennis hopper, the director, won't give much space to this one if he ever writes a memoir, i don't think.",0
very good dramatic comedy about a playwright trying to figure out how to keep his head above water after running out of ideas. can't say much about this film without giving away the story. i can say that little was as it seems as you are watching the picture. everybody has his or her own agenda. nice little surprise at the end - after all the other surprises. well written with good performances by all.,1
"notice that all those that did not like and enjoy this film commented that it was not as good as the book or that it differed from the book.  i don't understand this type of criticism. books and films are different media. while books have hours and hours to develop characters and story lines, films have about 120 minutes. yet the film has the advantage of stimulating several senses: visual, audio, as well as the imagination. i don't care if a film is as good as or, in fact, has any resemblance to the book on which it is based. who cares? i judge it for what it is.  this tv movie was charming. an old and oft-seen story, prone to cliché, it could easily have been embarrassing. however, riffen and reeves pull it off. one reviewer found riffen far to old. i would never have guessed she was 40 when she made this film. it is to her credit as an actress that she played a 23-24 year old amazingly well. i also think it is about the best thing reeves ever did. the story could have been stronger, and i agree the screen play could have used ""tightening."" nonetheless, it is well worth watching; clearly not a powerful love story, but rather, a charming romance which will leave you satisfied that love is a strong emotion and good overcomes evil. and it is nice to see a ""love story"" without the obligatory f#$% word, the naked buttocks, or hours of spit-swapping kissing.  lastly, the musical score is excellent.",1
"sorry fulci fans, but i could not get through this one. the soundtrack was about as annoying as they come, the acting was puerile, the story has been done and done, and the direction was non-existent.   massacre honestly looked like a children's film project. but i've seen some of those, and they actually look better than this did! it appears to have been so underfunded they couldn't afford ... anything! not a dop, not a director, no one who even remotely had a clue what acting was. it was a very poor cinematic experience; one of my worst.  this was about the worst suck-fest i've seen, next to terror toons which is second only to killer klowns from outer space. i've nothing else to say about it.  it rates a 0.1/10 from...  the fiend :.",0
"quentin crisp once stated that when things are shown too beautifully, one is a romantic. when things are show unbearably grim, they are realistic. and when something gets the ironic treatment, they're spot on. unfortunately for leon de aranoa, he falls into the second catagory. this director has obviously tried too hard to make a spanish ""ken loach"" type movie, without being able to capture the comedy, and warmth between the characters, that elevate loach movies from merely being 'depressing'. los lunes al sol, is just that, only depressing. things are unrealistically grim. the characters ultimate moments of misery all reach a climax at the same point, and if the glum story isn't enough, aranoa washes the tale over with a visually grey and grimy colour palette. the films was ridiculously over-rated at the goyas. a movie that shows empathy for the weaker citizens in society, in this case unemployed harbour workers, does not automatically make for a good movie, even though i would be the first to sympathize with the fates of these people. this movie only manages to make me grow disinterested in their fate. in 21st century spain, unemployed people do not live like beggars, and the public transport ferries have decent restrooms, and it's hard to come across a bar with so few punters and such little happiness to be encountered in it. leon de aranoa obviously doesn't have a clue about working class spain, and does it no favours. pretentious is the only conclusion i can draw. the scene where the men watch a football match for free, has been directly copied from a film which deals much more 'realistically' with the subject of the 'poverty' trap, namely ""purely belter,"" which is afar more engaging, humorous, and yet sad.",0
"this film is pure elvira and shows her at her breast... i mean best! the story (co-written by cassandra peterson, elvira's alter ego) is inspiring and captivating and is brought to life by elvira's wit and charm. the viewer gets an opportunity to see elvira in a whole new light as she struggles with the prejudices of the people of fallwell, massachusetts (where she has travelled from los angeles in order to attend the reading of her great aunt morganna's will) and at the same time tries to help the long-suffering teenagers who have been deprived of fun by the matriarchal chastity pariah and the rest of the town council. she also has to deal with her attraction to bob redding, the owner of the local cinema, and another woman (patty) who has her eye on bob as well but is not nearly as deserving of his love as elvira. and, later in the movie, she also faces the complications of being descended from ''a major metaphysical celebrity'' and the charges of witchcraft brought against her which mean that she will be burnt at the stake. elvira manages to be both sexy and vulnerable, streetwise and naive in this film, while cracking risque jokes and delivering off-beat lines with double meanings.  this movie is inspiring because it gives out the message of never giving up on yourself and always trying to follow your dreams. in the end elvira's dreams finally come true, which is the best thing that could happen to this wonderfully unique and determined woman.  i've seen this movie countless times and i never ever get tired of it! there are no unnecessary scenes and i found myself captivated throughout the whole movie. a review will not do justice to the actual movie, so i can just tell you to please watch it because it is one of the best movies ever made! meanwhile, i wish you ''unpleasant dreams!''",1
"the master of movie spectacle cecil b. de mille goes west. using three legends of the old west as its protagonists (they probably never met),gary cooper is portraying wild bill hickock,james ellison as buffalo bill and jean arthur does make a nice calamity jane. the story serves only for de mille to hang some marvelous action sequences on, like the big indian attack.scenes like that are extremely well done.if you don't mind the somewhat over-the-top performances of the cast this is an very entertaining western.look out for a very young anthony quinn essaying the role of an indian brave who participated at the battle of little big horn.this part got him at least noticed in hollywood.",1
"you gotta love the cheesy low budget movies. this one comes complete with bad effects, props and bad acting (really bad). plus, every time i see mercedes mcnab (the sister) i keep thinking 'watch out! she's a vamp!""- for those that know buffy/angel.  a perfect example of what happens when someone with bad taste and wants to waste money making a flick, the little that was spent of course. i don't know if i feel more sorry for the writer of the movie or the producer who didn't make back any money.  i'd say it's good for little kids in it's simplicity, but i don't know if i'd want to subject a kid to it...  umm...1/10 because that's the lowest it will go.",0
"warning: this review contains a spoiler.   wow. almost impressively bad. note i said, ""almost"". this is nothing more than lots of random scenes strung together in a loose attempt at a story. the protagonists (you cannot call them ""heroes"") shoot innocent bystanders for their food, and also rob same for similar reasons. there's also tons of homoeroticism, which was a turnoff for me. (spoiler: it seems as if the villainess (who only is topless and not naked as other reviews claim) gets killed early on, but miraculously recovers, adding another 70 minutes of audience-torture.) i can't shake the feeling that animal abuse occurred numerous times in this cinematic abomination. if you're in a mst3k mood, you might find this watchable, but for the most part you can forget it. go rent the original conan dvd instead.",0

"the books of james michener taking readers to faraway places with strange sounding names were probably at their most popular in the 1940s and 1950s. his tales of the south pacific became a major blockbuster broadway hit for rodgers&hammerstein. south pacific was directed by joshua logan and he was a natural to do the film adaption of another michener success, sayonara.  it was only a decade before that american films during world war ii did not portray the japanese kindly. i'm sure it wasn't easy for people who fought the pacific war to change attitudes overnight. that and a general no fraternization policy with occupied peoples in general are at the crux of this story about interracial romance.  sayonara is a relevant film today. the military has always butted in to the personal lives of its personnel in ways no civilian employer could get away with legally. in america at the time sayonara was made there were still miscegenation laws on the books in many states. today gays in the military is a big issue. someone may one day do a sayonara like film on that issue.  joshua logan was on familiar ground. south pacific also had racism as a component of its plot. with a sure hand, logan assembled a great cast and crafts a beautiful story.  marlon brando, patricia owens, james garner, kent smith some of the occidental players do a fine job. but the picture is stolen by the orientals here. miko taka hits the mark beautifully as brando's love interest. but the real stars are the two that one both supporting players oscars, red buttons and miyoshi umeki.  buttons is your everyman enlisted man air force member. he falls passionately in love with katsumi played by miyoshi umeki. they marry and the military cruelly does everything they can to break them up. they presume to know what's best for buttons and umeki. buttons was a tv comedian and a fair talent, but he never got a part as good as this the rest of his career.  and miyoshi umeki's oscar was the first one given to an oriental. it got a great deal of attention because at the time of the academy awards, miyoshi was starring on broadway in flower drum song. i was privileged to see it on broadway, it was the first broadway show i ever saw. i still carry the memory of it.  that oscar symbolized something else too. our war with japan was really over and we saw in sayonara a great nation with a proud tradition and culture.  ricardo montalban plays nakamura, a kabuki theatre actor. if sayonara were done today, logan would never get away with it. but montalban is fine.   good location photography and a grand story. this film should be revived more often it has a great moral.",1
"here we have a movie which fails in pretty much every way it is possible for a movie to fail. terrible script, lousy acting, amateurish directing, laughable special effects...it's just an utterly awful movie. not to mention the fact that when you get to the end you'll realize the whole thing doesn't make a lick of sense. after spending the whole movie wondering what in the world is going on here when things are finally explained you realize the story has been built on a foundation which is ludicrously impossible. in one of those hideous ""villain explains the whole movie"" sequences we are told that our villain has done something which quite simply can't be done and which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. oh, and after that we see that there also appears to be some kind of jell-o monster involved. i'm sure drew barrymore would very much like to pretend this movie never happened. if for some ungodly reason you are ever tempted to sit down and watch this movie may i suggest instead taking that time to bang your head against a wall for 104 minutes. that would prove to be a much more pleasurable experience than sitting through this garbage.",0
"as someone else has already said here, every scene in this film is gem. most films are lucky to have one scene that is perfect, but director jewison hit a home run every time. the cast got just the right take on the excellent script, and in addition, dick hyman's musical settings of the opera and the other music made for a perfect match. hard to imagine how they kept the precise mood going throughout the long production of a film. the comedy is subtle (mostly), and the camera-work mirrors every little emotional inflection of the narrative. cher is such a comedy natural, vincent gardenia (who i know mostly through his frank lorenzo role on all in the family until i saw him in this and then off-broadway in the 80's)deserved far greater stardom than he ever got, and aiello's hapless loser are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to giving kudos to this tremendous cast. has jewison ever written about this film?  would love to read it. hard to figure out why the average rating here at imdb is so low...",1
"i sometimes enjoy really lousy movies....those that occasionally result when people (even talented people) get together with good intentions to produce a movie and for whatever reason it turns out to be a disaster. movies like ""attack of the killer tomatoes"", ""plan 9 from outer space"", ""manos-hands of fate"", and ""heavens gate"", etc.  so, when i heard that this movie, ""rachel's attic"", was considered by many people to be the single worst film of the decade, naturally i just had to see it.  boy, do i regret that decision. this movie is beyond bad....it is so bad that it is not even as enjoyable as the usual bad movie. the acting, filming, script, etc. are even worse than a low budget porno film: the sound is utterly horrible, the ""plot"" is completely incomprehensible, the ""acting"" is laughable....it is a complete waste of everyone's time and money. at least the porno film has porno to break up the monotony, while this ridiculous nightmare has a guy squeezing a rotten apple, and a ""mad hatter's"" tea party.  the lighting is non-existent...many ""scenes"" take place in semi or complete darkness, which is probably just as well. the ""writer-director"" (i use the terms loosely), david tybor, tries to get kinky with bondage scenes...but the results would be laughable, if they weren't so pathetic. there is some nudity, but it is of such abysmal quality that it actually acts as a sexual suppressant. i could go on forever and not do justice to all the flaws and shortcomings of this truly awful waste of film.  for the love of god, avoid this train wreck. i know that despite (or perhaps because of) my negative comments, you may still be tempted to see if this piece of trash is really as bad as i claim it to be....but trust me on this....it's even worse than i have said, and you will absolutely, positively regret the experience (and expense, if you waste your money on a purchase or rental).",0
"ben & arthur could have been a 10. sam mraovich wrote, directed, stared, and produced this movie. sam should have given his idea to a good writer, director, and left the acting to somebody who could act. this is a good example of one person controlling the whole production. there was nobody to tell him, ""sam this is bad, really bad"".  jamie brett gabel's acting was the only good point, but he could have been so much better with a good director, and better actors to work with.   this movie is so bad i think sam mraovich should be tied to a chair and made to watch this movie (twice). the acting and direction was so bad, this movie was turned into a comedy. you just had to laugh, and in the wrong places.   a second good point....this would make a great date movie. after the first two minutes you would quit watching the movie and pay more attention to your date!",0
"i had the opportunity to see this film twice at the 2006 moving picture festival in birmingham, alabama. i enjoyed it so much that i watched it a second time when they had an encore screening.  when i think of the films that are shown at festivals, i usually expect them to be edgy and offbeat, often with the feel of an elaborate student project. there's nothing wrong with these types of projects of course, and i enjoy the unique styles of independent films, but sometimes i want to see a more mainstream approach to independent film-making. by ""mainstream,"" i mean more like a film produced for national release - in other words, a movie that you would see in a regular movie theater.  the writing, directing, cinematography, casting and acting in this movie are all totally pro. there is nothing typically independent about this film. as an aspiring director, i am always looking for movies that will motivate me to stop procrastinating and push harder to get my career going. this is one of those films. as i watched the big bad swim, my motivation level was incredible. i felt like my adrenaline had kicked in. the reason i felt this way was because i was so impressed with every aspect of this production. i left the theater excited and ready to start writing that long put-off project. when a movie makes me feel like that, i know it's really good. this is the first feature-length project from ishai setton and i found myself wishing that it had been my project. for me, that's really rare.  see this film. it's beautifully shot and directed, and the casting is excellent. paget brewster delivers a very believable and likable performance. she has a quality about her, a charisma, that really draws you in and keeps you focused on her any time she is on screen. she makes you feel like you know her personally as a friend. that's a gift. i think the industry is really missing out by not utilizing her acting abilities more often. jeff branson and jess weixler also did top-notch jobs. i can not say enough nice things about the big bad swim. i look forward to future projects from all of those involved in its production.",1

"the film is bad. there is no other way to say it. the story is weak and outdated, especially for this country. i don't think most people know what a ""walker"" is or will really care. i felt as if i was watching a movie from the 70's. the subject was just not believable for the year 2007, even being set in dc. i think this rang true for everyone else who watched it too as the applause were low and quick at the end. most didn't stay for the q&a either.  i don't think schrader really thought the film out ahead of time. many of the scenes seemed to be cut short as if they were never finished or he just didn't know how to finish them. he jumped from one scene to the next and you had to try and figure out or guess what was going on. i really didn't get woody's (carter) private life or boyfriend either. what were all the ""artistic"" male bondage and torture pictures (from iraq prisons) about? what was he thinking? i think it was his very poor attempt at trying to create this dark private subculture life for woody's character (car). it didn't work. it didn't even seem to make sense really.  the only good thing about this film was woody harrelson. he played his character (car) flawlessly. you really did get a great sense of what a ""walker"" may have been like (say twenty years ago). he was great and most likely will never get recognized for it.   as for lauren, lily and kristin... boring.  don't see it! it is painful! unless you are a true harrelson fan.",0
"basically this is an overlong, unfunny, action/comedy. first of all i'd like to say that i did enjoy the wayans brother scary movie (1) and the sequel had it's moments. unfortunately white chicks doesn't even deliver half the laughs.   the humour in it is absolutely crude. if you like burping, farting, stupid catchphrases you should probably look at this. when it isn't crude it's idiotic. the first 10 minutes of the film gave everything away to me, totally unfunny, simply idiotic.   however i watched the whole thing since i was with a friend (otherwise i wouldn't have bothered). the story is undeniably thin, it was in scary movie too but there at least the laughs were quick and constant. i think this is probably one of the main problems too with this film, the laughs don't come quick enough. some jokes are dragged out too long when they're more disgusting than funny in the first place. if you prefer your comedy with a few brain cells then just avoid this. if you want a silly comedy with more laughs then look at scary movie, airplane, hotshots 1 + 2.   1/10 completely unfunny, thin storyline, a film that seems to be based on one idea (i.e. what if we dressed up as white chicks for a film?) but simply didn't have enough material.",0

(call me a feminist, but i prefer my female leads to have a spine.) the gags & gimmicks of the show also become hackneyed, the music of vonda shepherd (which is really shoved in your face) becomes grating, and the incessant character changes & rewrites make the show into a damn soap opera.  my advice to you is to take this show in small doses, and quit as soon as it becomes bothersome (and it will). i made it through 2.5 seasons before my enjoyment had totally soured. it was good while it lasted, but like a crazy, neurotic ex-girlfriend it just turned ugly after it had overstayed its welcome.  and next time you go to ihop, skip the pancakes. order something healthy like the fruit cup. it'll sit with you much better.",0

"`our song' gives us the lives of the three teenagers lanisha, maria and joycelyn - best girlfriends hanging at the end of summer. adolescent summer - even if we don't know the signals and landmarks of this particular terrain, crown heights, brooklyn - is/was the same for us all. a lazy respite from the pressures and tumult of school. welcome heat and idleness.  but if this experience of adolescence is universal, the inner city of the 90s is a different place than most of us know - maybe as foreign a country as any. young bodies carving new silhouettes...beckoning new territory...the maze towards adulthood. the young mind coming into itself, speaking for itself, saying this is who i am, this is who i want to try to be. it is/was always thus. but this is how it plays out in brooklyn in the late 90s.  jim mckay is the writer/director of this film project but he acknowledges all who have shouted suggestions at him. the opening title slide `a film by' seems to list everyone in the universe. it's a gesture but by the end of the film, we know it to be a genuine one. [the closing titles also have some of the most on-the-money and appreciative credits i've read.] the vivid sound recording by jan mclaughlin deserves to be especially noted. mckay's a modest leader who knows who is telling this story - it's his three graces lanisha, maria and joycelyn. they're the real thing, their interactions have the fire of real friendship and the focus of reality. this ain't no music video shorthand telling of teenage life. it has the seriousness of the long unblinking stare.  hanging out with them, we don't quite feel included but we do feel privileged to be listening in. these are real voices speaking with plainness about the crises and dullness of daily life. we are witness to the modern math of teenage life - how its problems are interpreted, calculated and summed and solved. small scenes illustrate large thoughts throughout. lanisha hangs with her dad at his security job - it's the only way she gets to spend time with him. we see the love that exists between them but also the failures of family and fatherhood. in a connected scene, lanisha defends her dad to her mom, and we see how desperately she needs to love them both and for them to love her in return. later, the three friends lay in the dark sharing visions and dreams - and we remember how crazy/funny kids are and more tragically, how realism hammers idealism these days. and at the end, maria simply walking down the street is a short story in itself. we see her gather up the courage to hold all her fears and doubts at bay. she demonstrates for us the strength one needs to have to be able to embrace the fragility that makes life livable.  `our song's greatest gift is that we really feel deeply the terribly ephemeral nature of friendship - how, one day, alive and enlivening, that intimacy can, in the next, just turn and drift away. it's awful, but that's just the way it is, isn't it?",1

"this movie has it all. it is a classic depiction of the events that surrounded the migration of thousands of cuban refugees. antonio montana(played by al pacino), is just one of the thousands to get a chance to choose his destiny in america. this cinematic yet extremely accurate depiction of miamis' drug empire is astonishing. brian depalma does an amazing job directing this picture, so much that, the viewer becomes involved with both the storyline, as well as every character in the cast. with tony's characters' pressence being so believable and strong, brian depalma brang out the raw talent exposed by steven bauer(manny, tony's best friend), mary elizabeth mastantonio(gina, tony's sister), robert loggia(frank, tony's boss)and michelle pfeiffer(elvira, frank's wife). i enjoyed every minute watching this movie, and still watch it on a weekly basis. on this year, the 20th anniversary of this classic crime movie, i for one am a true believer that in another 20 years people will still refer to this movie in astonishing numbers. with other crime movies being so dramatic i find, this movie is a shock to the system.",1

"holy crap this movie was bad. i watched it just as a joke. it isn't even so bad that it's good in an unintentional way. this film seemed to be designed to personally make me angry. it worked really well at doing that. it's as if the people who made this just took all of the really annoying stuff about the movie priest, added in a bunch of ugly dudes, took out anything interesting, funny, or even remotely sexy and clever out of the concoction, and then added in a bunch of old rotten cheese. that's all this is. cheese. there isn't a single person this film could possibly connect to. there isn't any universe this film could possibly take place in. why can't a film like this just be about enjoying life and being happy? why did they have to make this already stupid idea for a film even more ridiculous than it already is? why couldn't they at least even tried to make it an okay film, or even a b-movie. now that i think of it, what they hell were they trying to do with this film? i watched it expecting a campy love story and instead i got some boring student project about some idiot who has to find the strength and courage to marry his boyfriend while his annoying christian brother tried to destroy it all!!! no, i'm not joking. that's what it's about. does that sound good? this film is pretty ignorant against people of the christan religion, with it's stereotyping of all christians being loudmouthed, rude, and hellbent on making as many people as miserable as possible. a lot of christian people i know would never speak or act like these freaks. the film, however, is just as unfair and ignorant to the gay community as well. these have got to be the most tastelessly crafted stereotypical gay men since the guy on the radio station on that roadkill video game. it's so nerve wracking and simply irritating to the point that i wasn't able to fully pay attention to this film. the makers of this train-wreck had no strategy for set design, acting, camera angles, lighting, script, authenticity, or an idea to make this entertaining or interesting. there isn't even a single sex scene, or at least not a believable one. jamie brett gabel was the only guy in the film that looked any good at all, but his good looks were sadly put to waste. this is trash. in a perfect world, this film would get voted a 0.0. it's worth 0 as a film alone. a mentally handicapped nun who is blind, deaf, and has tiny little bones for arms and legs and whose face is located on her armpit could write, direct, and produce a better film, and she'd probably be a better actor as well. the fact that this film exists is a crime against the word ""film"" itself. this film is so bad that other films should be ashamed of being available in the same watchable format. i could put a broom in a chair and then record it with a camera and then stop the film and then replace it with a mini x-mas tree and then record that and i've already made a film that will always be better than ben & arthur by at least half. there are only two things worse than death. torture and watching ben & arthur. i'm a homosexual and i will probably be the gayest person you will ever meet if you ever met me, and i don't think i've ever been more offended by an entire film than i was by the first five seconds of this film alone. if this movie was a mistake, i will personally find a way to change the famous phrase ""it's okay to make mistakes"" to ""it's okay to make mistakes unless that mistake was ben & arthur."" you know how people always say things like, ""good things come out of everything!""? i think that ben & arthur was primarily invented so that there could be something on this earth that nothing good would ever come out of. to call this movie the worst movie i've ever seen would be giving it way too much credit. it's as if this film were designed just so that it could qualify in a category of it's very own. there are good movies, there are bad movies, and then there's ben & arthur. this is ben and arthur.",0
"wonderful cast wasted on worthless script. ten or so adults reunite at the summer camp they attended as juveniles. could this ever happen in a million years? it's simply a fantasy, and a boring one at that. do they become teenagers again? do they reenact their pranks, games, good times? they may try but ultimately the answer is: no. is there any intrigue? any suspense? horror? comedy? none of the above. how anyone can be entertained by this drivel is beyond me. i wanted to like this movie; i tried to like this movie, but my brain refused.",0
"normally, i don't watch action movies because of the fact that they are usually all pretty similar. this movie did have many stereotypical action movie scenes, but the characters and the originality of the film's premise made it much easier to watch. david duchovny bended his normal acting approach, which was great to see. angelina jolie, of course, was beautiful and did great acting. great cast all together. a must see for people bored with the same old action movie.",1

"just came out of a sneak preview for this film. it had me laughing every 30 secs. the ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing i hadn't bought that large coke. there are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. the movie lets steve carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both jim carrey in ""bruce almighty"" and will ferrell ""anchorman: the legend of ron burgendy"" in their movies. paul rudd is hilarious as always. i love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like p.s.). i think that seth rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. leslie mann also had some incredibly funny moments. i highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. however, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. if you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. and, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those ""hip"" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. it would make for some incredibly awkward moments.",1
"a squashy slapstick mess posing as a comedy. elvis presley plays an indian bull-riding champ who leaves the rodeo for a stay at home on his folks' desert-spread in arizona, where government suits have just invested in the family's herd of cattle (which is in dire need of a stud). what director peter tewksbury is in dire need of is some narrative skills, though what he lacks in assessment he makes up for in sloppy comedic montages (his social commentary isn't exactly pointed, but tewksbury does have a satiric bend to his outlandishness and there are some funny scenes). despite colorful supporting turns by katy jurado and joan blondell, the general wackiness gets way out of hand, and there's too much hoopin' and hollerin' to sustain much interest. as for elvis, he's loose and frisky throughout--and while it's nice to see him having fun on-screen, one has to wonder if he had just given up on movies at this point. this shambles of a picture has a distinct what-the-hell feel to it, and though spirits are high, the returns are mostly low. *1/2 from ****",0
"the only thing about this film that bums me out is that the dvd is so expensive. it's too much for my budget at the moment, or i would purchase it, because the film is a good example of film noir...and i enjoy watching richard widmark, jean peters and thelma ritter.  criterion produces great dvds but sometimes the asking price is just a bit much. that's the case here for an 80-minute black-and-white, mono sound film that is good but nothing extraordinary, cinematography-wise.  the story is the story here (as opposed to visuals, actors, sound, sets, etc.) as a pickpocket (widmark) inadvertently winds up with espionage microfilm in his possession after pilfering peters' purse. (say that three times!). everyone but peters is a believable character in this movie: widmark, the cops, the u.s. agents and the communists and, especially ritter as ""moe,"" an informant. she and widmark are the stars of this film.  peters does a decent job of playing the cheap floozy but loses her credibility early on by ""falling in love"" with widmark on the first meeting even though he's nasty to her. only in world of film!! too bad, because that ludicrous romance part of the story takes away from it.  this an average film noir which means good, but not great and certainly not worth owning at a price of $25-$35. for that price, one could do a lot better in the film noir market.",1
"frank capra's creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film. while it has a few charming moments, and many wonderful performers, capra's outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story, broadway bill (1934), is downright shoddy. it is understandable that he would re-use footage from the climactic horse race, which is thrilling. but he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors, then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice, for example, that ward bond is 14 years older! unless you want to see one of the last appearances of oliver hardy, skip this one and watch broadway bill instead.",0

"this is a film that takes some digesting. on the one hand, we are offered a tough outward shell, a story that does not only derive the catholic church, but does so foolishly, and uninformed. on an inner layer, we are offered a story of orthodoxy over orthopraxis, and what happens when people follow blindly a faith that they must not understand.  at first glance, it appeared this was supposed to be a comedy. if so, then mr. durang needs to open a dictionary, because he clearly does not know the meaning of the word. the jokes are pale; the humor is awkward and poorly delivered. in particular, ms. keaton's performance is flighty and over the top, well below the quality of her annie hall and sleeper days. jennifer tilly is again the model of stridence, with her hi-pitched voice and whining style. all of this could be forgiven if it weren't for the last 20 minutes of this movie, that evidently was a controversial play made in 1981.  ***careful, spoilers ahead***  it all starts with the appearance of four former students of sister mary ignatius (ignatius, by the way, is a male name, and a nun would not adopt it after her vows under any circumstance simply due to that fact, just to show you how much tireless research went into the project to begin with.) when they all admit that they don't live up to the church's teachings, the sister proceeds to become irrational and abuse them in a manner the audience is to believe she did way back when in the corny, all-too-cliché sepia-tone flashbacks. when one of them admits to having two abortions, the nun becomes even more abusive, until the pupil pulls out a gun. after wrestling it away from her, the nun kills the pupil, presumably in self-defense. she then goes on a screaming rampage, killing a gay former student because of his sins. the last shot is of the dead female pupil lying in a christ-like pose as a shadow of a cross hangs over her. can you say `heavy handed?' i knew you could!  i know there have been abusive nuns in the past, and i know many people have been emotionally harmed as a result, but this imagery is fed down our throats in almost every other shot in this train wreck of a movie. i have heard from the writer and the director that this is a film about hysteria and why one should not follow the orthodoxy so religiously, no pun intended. this explanation is hard to swallow, though, simply because we are never given an authoritative viewpoint that is not biased against the catholic faith in one way or another. this film is simply anti-catholic tripe, which in the name of fairness and equality, is mean spirited and hateful.  this is a film i would recommend for a catholic, namely to awaken him or her to the realities of what cynicism and ignorance they face today. if it were `rabbi ray explains it all' or `imam muhammad explains it all', there would be rioting in the streets and showtime would lose all of its subscription. but, sadly, because this is a film that strikes out against what is perceived to be the majority, it is accepted and even applauded by those who share the same spiteful point of view.  i certainly hope every member of that cast was a practicing catholic, so it wasn't just ignorance that brought them to make this film.  i give it 1.5 stars out of 5, not because of its offensive nature, but because it was poorly written, poorly directed and just a bad movie in general. don't even waste your time.",0

(i can't agree, however, with anyone who says young is too old for the role. if she is, we should all age so nicely.) for the most part this film left me cold, though it's by no means the worst of its type you'll ever see. and unlike the recent 'eyes wide shut,' at least something happens in this one.",0
"in one word... abysmal. i give it one star for the hippie sex scenes and eye candy women, otherwise forget it. corman's worst effort, bar none. ben vereen should have had his name permanently stricken from the cast. i cannot believe that this is now going to be on dvd (as of 2/15/05) with ""wild in the streets"" - another retro stinker. i woke up sick in bed this morning with a cold, decided to watch a movie to cheer me up some, scanned the digital channels... the premise looked interesting enough because i like viewing b-movie sci-fi, hippie culture and rebellious teen flicks. it seemed familiar somehow and with ben vereen in the cast, i thought... why not? what a big mistake... it was a horrible start to my day.  only after viewing it, i now know why the familiarity crept into the recesses of my newly-awakened brain. i remembered seeing coming attractions for this film as a 14-year old (i'm 45), back in the early/mid-seventies at the sombrero, a local art theater that no longer exists... the whole theater laughed hysterically and even groaned out loud at how bad this movie looked. acting: dreadful, story: awful, cinematography: nearly-awful, music: terrible, sound: horrendous, directing: a joke. if you choose to watch this after my warning, remember... ""i told you so.""  ""gass-s-s-s"" is the perfect title for this film... you feel ""gassed"" after viewing this putrid movie - or maybe that you should be taken to a ""gas"" chamber for wasting your brain away. i have seen homemade super 8 movies that put this film to shame. definitely a new addition to my all-time top ten worst films... it's up there (er, down there) with ""tentacles.""   ted in gilbert, az",0
"wow, here it finally is; the action ""movie"" without action. in a real low-budget setting (don't miss the hilarious flying saucers flying by a few times) of a future seattle we find a no-brain hardbody seeking to avenge her childhood.  there is nothing even remotely original or interesting about the plot and the actors' performance is only rivalled in stupidity by the attempts to steal from other movies, mainly ""matrix"" without having the money to do it right. yes, we do get to see some running on walls and slow motion shoot-outs (45 secs approx.) but these scenes are about as cool as the stupid hardbody's attempts at making jokes about male incompetence now and then.  and, yes, we are also served a number of leads that lead absolutely nowhere, as if the script was thought-out by the previously unseen cast while shooting the scenes.  believe me, it is as bad as it possibly can get. in fact, it doesn't deserve to be taken seriously, but perhaps i can make some of you not rent it and save your money.",0
"other reviewers here seem to think this is an awful film. that's simply not true and a little unfair.  the acting is of a good quality and the direction moves on with a decent fluidity. i don't think there's anything wrong with the tarantino-esquire way of interlocking stories together. perhaps its just a new tool for directors to try. i thought it made the film much more interesting. perhaps a few elements of the script need tightening, but that's about the only fault i can find. nestor cantillana gives a great performance as sylvio, also antonella rios is stunning and worth the price of admission alone.",1
"this was the only time i ever walked out on a movie. years later, i saw it in the cable listings and thought, ""maybe i should give it another try."" suffice to say that i was right the first time. this ranks second only to godzilla 1998 as the worst movie i've ever seen.",0
"so you might be reading some of the comments posted on this film, and you might be thinking to yourself, ""huh. there were sure a bunch of rave reviews posted on december 30."" funny thing is, most of these rave reviews sound like they're coming from the same person, or at best a small, coordinated group of ""open house"" groupies. the truth, my friends, is that this film is truly unwatchable. just because it's ""independent"" doesn't mean it gets a free pass. if you're going to make a musical, whether on film or on stage, whether on broadway or at the local community playhouse, you should probably make sure that (a.) your actors can sing, (b.) your actors can dance, (c.) you have decent sound equipment, (d.) you have a well-written score, and (e.) you have lyrics that are witty and charming. even anthony rapp can't save this one. it's one of those unfortunate movie-going experiences where i actually felt deeply embarrassed for everyone involved.",0
"it is important not to be insulted by lack of logic or common sense and those who have any ""gray matters"" will agree that this movie just doesn't work.  the problems lay in the direction, cast selections and lack of depth in the character building. the word comedy was very hard thing to say when i expect to laugh when these words are used. let's look at the problems in direction/script.  brother and sister both in their mid 30's seem to be well adjusted. they meet a complete stranger at a park and heather graham character walks up to her and asks the most intimate questions that even half sane person would be running the other way or at least scream for a police officer. he then awkwardly walks over and makes some stupid statements and she falls for him. then after one date were they all go out together he falls in love with her and decides to get married in vegas in a week's time???? hello does anyone feel stupid yet? he goes out with thousands of women and he meets this one person who says about 10 words that we see on the screen and he wants to marry her. not only was there no chemistry it just doesn't make sense. sure it's a romantic comedy and i want to believe it could, but the direction made it completely flat.  now heather falls head over heels with her too and when heather graham and bridget moynahan (very shallow character) kiss or more to the point it was sloppiest kiss ever that chemistry might be there. i found it unromantic and unfunny and while many say heather cannot act i think the reality is heather was clearly the wrong person for this role.   this was sue kramer debut as a director and to me it was just too much for her to chew. it would take a lot of craft to make this movie work and imho it could be done with better writers and casting and direction.",0
"in our household, we are enormous fans of a christmas carol and watch virtually every version each christmas, including the old 1938 reginald owen and the modern 1999 patrick stewart. our overall favorite is the 1951 black & white classic, because alastair sim is ebeneezer scrooge and his conversion rings the truest. however, this 1984 rendition has its own unique merits and makes a lovely & entertaining story, quite faithful generally to dickens' novel. (see my comments on the other film adaptations, if interested)  first of all, george c. scott can certainly seem pretty crotchety and doesn't make a bad scrooge. i adore his sideburns, his long topcoat & hat. he cuts the finest fashion figure of the lot, and quite a handsome gentleman. however, sometimes it seems scott is enjoying his role as scrooge just a wee bit too much and not taking it quite as seriously as he ought!  this rendition has the best overall christmas atmosphere, hopeful and optimistic. somehow you know this story is going to have a happy ending. filmed in the town of shrewsbury, england, it just seems somehow very british. the film has a lovely musical score, with wonderful, lively caroling music throughout all the appropriate portions of the tale. sometimes i could almost smell the chestnuts roasting and the pudding singing in the copper!   marley's anguished ghost (with his wonderful jaw dropping scene) and the three spirits are all quite convincing. christmas past is a lovely ethereal lady, christmas present wonderfully giant and jovial, christmas yet to come shrouded and foreboding as always. however, i found scrooge's nephew, fred, a wee bit quiet & grim, not nearly as jolly & hearty as he should be. i like the nephew's wife, whom they've named janet, with her lovely, sprightly period hairstyle. instead of blind man's bluff, they've concocted a game called similes for the nephew's christmas dinner party, which is a cute little touch, scrooge getting right into the spirit of the thing.  the cratchits and their somewhat meagre (though much appreciated) christmas dinner are well depicted, with bob (david warner) suitably sympathetic and long-suffering in his miles of scarf. mrs. cratchit is charmingly portrayed by susannah york, who also starred with george c. scott in the wonderful 1970 adaptation of jane eyre. above all, this version has unquestionably the best tiny tim, not only an adorable & endearing little waif but sickly. with those dark circles under his eyes, the frail wee thing looks unlikely to survive the hour!  this is a delightful & heartwarming version of the holiday classic. with its festive atmosphere, it's sure to put you in the spirit of the season.",1
"in life, we first organize stones (piedras in spanish) such as a career, family, friendship, and love. in this way, we shall find space between these to fit smaller stones, our small necessities. if you act in an inverse way, you will not have enough room for larger stones. the five protagonists in this film are women who have not been able to organize the large ""stones"" in their lives. ramon salazar, a spanish motion picture director defines his first feature stones in this way. the film tells the parallel, conflicting trajectory of five women: anita (monica cervera, 1975-), isabel (angela molina, 1955-), adela (antonia san juan, 1961-), leire (najwa nimri, 1972-), and maricarmen (vicky pena, 1954-).all are endeavoring to remove the stones that insistently appear in their path or, worst, that are in their shoes. they are five cinderellas in search of prince charming and a new chance in life. the best story of these five cinderellas is that of anita (monica cervera) who also stars in ""20 centimeters,"" ""busco,"" ""crimen ferpecto,"" ""entre vivir y sonar,"" ""hongos,"" and ""octavia."" sarge booker of tujunga, california",1

"star rating: ***** the works **** just misses the mark *** that little bit in between ** lagging behind * the pits   some plutonium's gone missing and some very nasty people now have the means to develop a bomb capable of wholesale destruction- so josh mccord (chuck norris) and his cocky young protégé deke (judson mills, a different actor from the previous film) with the assistance of josh's adopted daughter que (jennifer tung) set out to stop them.  this was another film that dealt with terrorism a year after the events of 9/11. filmed in 2001, norris himself even commented afterwards how eerily the plot line to the film resembled what happened in downtown new york that day, so there'd have been those that would have been in the mood for a film where norris and his side-kick kick some terrorist ass if nothing else. other than that, it's as interchangeable as anything norris has ever been in. it makes you wonder what the original did to warrant a sequel in the first place, and whether if this one could get made a president's man 3 might come out sometime soon.  if you've seen one norris film, you've really seen them all and there's really nothing new or unexpected that happens with this one, but at least you know what you're getting and, like i said, it might have been just what some needed to let off some steam. **",0
"sure it takes place in the west, but the title makes it seem like it is a conventional western. instead, it is a movie of a woman sheriff. make no mistake though this is a bad movie about a woman sheriff. she becomes sheriff when her husband is gunned down; she is only a tad bit upset by this. her main goal is to go after the villain who is also a woman, but the villain hires a guy to kill her. so this is what happens, the hero falls in love with the killer and vice versa. utterly stupid, as anyone killed in this movie has the new sheriff to thank. she had more than a few chances to put the killer behind bars, but i guess because she liked him she wouldn't do it. the killer is also after the mayor of the town for personal reasons that are also rather dumb. this movie is very boring and not really worth watching...it is not one of the better episodes of mst3000 they made. i can not imagine anyone seeing this without them because that would make it that much more painful. corman is a low budget director, but even he should know better than to have people go into one place and coming out another.",0
"i remember seeing this on tv in the late 70s - and it stayed with me! it's charming, loud, colourful - a great kids film. i put it on for some friends at a party recently - and naturally they thought i was mad and expected something sick to happen to the puppets a la ""meet the feebles"" but no - its wholesome clean fun.  jack wild is in fine form, as is mama cass, and the somehow attractive witchy poo.  if you like the banana splits and you are in your 30's this will re-create that surreal childhood saturday morning vibe!  even if i've realised now that puf himself is a bit crap - as all he does is get captured and run away! quality tv movie - if, like me, you are into death metal - you'll love it!",1
"this is an ok adaptation, but not as good as the tv version. the actors are generally alright but i found jeremy northam rather wet as mr knightley, particularly compared to mark strong in the tv version. gwyneth paltrow is ok and her english accent is pretty good but again, i preferred kate beckinsale's emma. there are excellent support performances from toni collette, juliet stephenson and sophy thompson.  the script is often played too much for laughs, the book is a comedy, but there are too many set-piece gags here, and also the frank churchill subplot is almost completely absent.  my biggest criticism is the scenery. it is far too lush. england has never been like this. it looks like a chocolate box. only americans would make it like this.  despite these criticisms i enjoyed this film but would recommend the tv adaptation more.",1
"shallow grave begins with either a tribute or a rip off of the shower scene in psycho. (i'm leaning toward rip off.) after that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the ""yankee comes down south to get killed by a bunch of rednecks"" genre because it is actually shot in the south.  a group of college girls head to ft. lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (note to yankees: stay on the highway when you go to florida.) sue ellen (lisa stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. when she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (tony march) strangle his mistress (merry rozelle) to death. (note to yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the south; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) this is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good.  while tony march will never have to practice his oscar speech, his sheriff dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. tom law is likable as deputy scott and is as authentic a southern deputy as i've seen since walton goggins (deputy steve naish) in house of 1000 corpses.  a few scenes in the movie are worth the mention. the girls stop at a bbq in south carolina and display their racism when a big black guy checks them out. sue ellen runs into a barn to hide behind some hay bales and in a shockingly realistic moment a large snake is hiding in the hay with her.  and in the strangest scene, sheriff dean makes like he's about to rape patty (carol cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do. the preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his bible. his sermon is about how jezebel is saved by the blood of jesus christ. i feel sorry for this preacher's flock. jezebel was in the old testament a few thousand years before christ was born and by no means is she one of the five people you are going to meet in heaven.",0
"maléfique is a very interesting movie. it is an unholy alloy of triumphs and failures. the central concept is great, three inmates with bizarre personalities are joined by a fourth (who the audience identify with) and they try to escape from their cell using a book of magic that they find within the walls of the cell.  the atmosphere is well-woven, it reminds me of reading about the prison stay of edmond dantes' in the château d'if (prior to becoming the count of monte cristo). the director sets up the feeling that the characters are tied to the cell, particularly the character we are meant to identify with (carrère - a white-collar criminal whose crime is not specified, but it's obliquely suggested might be fraud). on one occasion carrère dithers when leaving the cell for exercise and has the cell door shut on him; we never leave the cell, the claustrophobia is unbroken. there are also no shots of the prison outside the cell, and the view through the bars is a longing sunset over a generic prison wall. so even though the film appears to be very modern, it has a very old world feel of incarceration.  the characters are intriguing. we have marcus, a violent pre-op transsexual who plays an abusive mother to pâquerette (french for daisy) a heavily retarded young man. pâquerette likes to eat everything he finds beautiful, and unfortunately this included his baby sister, hence his current predicament (i like this comment on internalisation, very primitive). lasalle is a withdrawn, possessed elderly man, in for brutally murdering his wife.  the central message of the movie is that your desires will annihilate you, and there's a ritual that goes with that. i think that's what disturbs me the most, seeing people destroying themselves ritualistically. it has a real life ring to it. the quite simple soundtrack backs this up well, every step deeper into the quicksand is accompanied by the dull ringing of a gong. i'm actually hearing the gong now every time i do something self-destructive.  i think one of the plot problems is that the ends of the characters don't really reinforce the message consistently, particularly with carrère, also the concept of the book seems to alter throughout the film, not in terms of a successive revelation either. i also think that some of the images we see are a bit amateurish, more by design than execution, such as the famous ""vagina eye"", and the sodomy of lasalle, for me, totally hollow images.  at the end the movie it feels like the director is in a rush to get it over with, and some things don't seem logical, for example we've been clumsily led to believe different things about carrère's child. this doesn't change the fact though that what we have here is that rare bird, a ""pure"" horror movie. there is no comedic dross or genre segueing, like cube (1997/natali), the obvious movie to compare it to, it's a total immersion experience, where you feel as if you are in the cell with the characters. this last comment i make about it being a ""pure"" experience i think is something others have mentioned as well so that is a fairly unanimous point.  on a personal note my favourite part of the film is when lasalle talks about his past as a librarian. he very vividly describes a scene where he goes to work one day and sits down in his usual place in the centre of a room where all the books are arranged in a circle around him. the books seem to be chanting to him that he will never contain their knowledge. this prompts lasalle to go insane. that really is the problem with an obsession with understanding and knowledge. it's something i myself have felt.  one final comment is that two of the quite well-received comments on the board have confused the characters' names. to convince yourself that lasalle is the older librarian character, simply click on philippe laudenbach's page and you will see he was born in 1936.",1
"an excellent depiction of one of the more unwholesome aspects of that era. i loved the visuals--very fitting for a story connected to a graphic novel.  i thought tom hanks was really great in this, he came across very well as someone who has been hardened by his work (which he didn't fully choose for himself) but still wants to have a normal life for his family. he does the best he can to see that happen. don't want to spoil the plot--but you have to see this movie if you are a person who wants more from a movie than the usual shoot 'em up action/gangster format.

"there has been a political documentary, of recent vintage, called why we fight, which tries to examine the infamous military industrial complex and its grip on this nation. it is considered both polemical and incisive in making its case against both that complex and the war fiasco we are currently involved in in iraq. yet, a far more famous series of films, with the same name, was made during world war two, by hollywood director frank capra. although considered documentaries, and having won oscars in that category, this series of seven films is really and truly mere agitprop, more in the vein of leni reifenstal's triumph of the will, scenes of which capra recycles for his own purposes. that said, that fact does not mean it does not have vital information that subsequent generations of world war two documentaries (such as the bbc's lauded the world at war) lacked, nor does that mean that its value as a primary source is any the less valuable. they are skillfully made, and after recently purchasing some used dvds at a discount store, i found myself with the opportunity to select a free dvd with my purchase. i chose goodtimes dvd's four dvd collection of the series.  rarely has something free been so worth invaluable. while there are no extras on the dvds, and the sound quality of the prints varies, these films provide insight into the minds of americans two thirds of a century ago, when racism was overt (as in many of the classic warner brothers pro-war cartoons of the era), and there was nothing wrong with blatant distortion of facts. the seven films, produced between 1942 and 1945, are prelude to war, the nazis strike, divide and conquer, the battle of britain, the battle of russia, the battle of china, and war comes to america.  overall, the film series is well worth watching, not only for the obvious reasons, but for the subtle things it reveals, such as the use of the plural for terms like x millions when referring to dollars, rather than the modern singular, or the most overused graphic in the whole series- a japanese sword piercing the center of manchuria. yet, it also shows the complexities of trying to apply past standards to current wars. the lesson of world war one (avoid foreign entanglements) was not applicable to world war two, whose own lesson (act early against dictatorships) has not been applicable in the three major wars america has fought since: korea, vietnam, nor iraq. the fact that much of this series teeters on the uncertainties of the times it was made in only underscores its historic value in today's information-clogged times. it may not help you sort out the truth from the lies and propaganda of today, but at least you'll realize you are not the first to be in such a tenuous position, nor will you be the last.",1

"this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!. all the characters are great, and the story while bizarre, is fascinating and very interesting, plus nicole kidman is simply amazing in this!. it's very hard to describe this movie, because it really is quite bizarre, it's a comedy/romance, one minute then it turns into a thriller the next, however it was still very entertaining all the same, plus nicole's russian accent was fantastic, and extremely convincing. chaplin and kidman had very good chemistry together, and i loved vincent cassel's performance!, plus some of the plot twists really took me by surprise!. the ending was very cute, and it's unpredictable throughout!, plus this movie is quite underrated as well!. you will feel sorry for chaplin and the way that he is scammed, and i thought all the characters were really likable, plus the finale is especially good.this is nicole's movie though, and she carries it with her incredibly sexy performance!. this is a great little film, that's very unique, and creative, with some great plot twists and wonderful performances!, i highly recommend this one!. the direction is very good!. jez butterworth does a very good job here, with great camera work, solid angles and keeping the film at a fast pace!. the acting is wonderful!. nicole kidman, is stunningly gorgeous!, and is amazing as always, she is incredibly sexy, very likable, had one of the coolest accents, added a lot of presence, had very good chemistry with ben chaplin, and had a very mysterious character!, she was amazing. (kidman rules!!!!). ben chaplin is great here, he is extremely likable, had a cool character, had very good chemistry with kidman, the only thing i didn't like was him taking out his anger out on kidman, even though what she did was wrong, and i loved how he got revenge in the end!. vincent cassel is fantastic as the main villain, yes he was ott, but he was very intense and quite creepy at times, this role was perfect for him. mathieu kassovitz is ok here, but didn't have much to do. rest of the cast are fine. overall i highly recommend this one!. ***1/2 out of 5",1
"this film is not about a cat and mouse fight as stated in the other comment. its about a cat that has used up 8 of its 9 lives and now lives in fear of loosing its last one. the cat is jumpy and scared to death all of the time, hence the name 'fraidy cat'. fraidy cat's previous lives haunt him as ghosts which are from different era's in time and are constantly trying to kill him off, but he is most fearful of the ninth life which is represented as a cloud in the shape of a number 9 and spits out lighting bolts. very old now but would still be fun for the kids if you got hold of a copy.   i watched this movie almost every day as a child :o)",1
"when i heard that this movie was coming out the night before halloween, i was very excited. when i found out that it was a book, written in 1978, i had to read it before seeing the movie. i'm sure the movie would have been much different to me if i had not read the book. the writers actually did a good job of staying true to the main plot of the book, with minor differences, naturally. i think the thing that disappointed me the most about the movie was boyle playing the role of col. i'm not a big fan of boyle, and it seems that no matter what the mood during the movie, she's always trying to use her over-plumped lips, and darkly makeup-ed eyes to make herself seem super sexy. indeed, i think that the movie held true to the genuine creepiness of the house. my favorite subplot was the sheehan family (which is so weird b/c the son was killed in iraq and in current events there is casey sheehan whose mother went on a huge anti-iraq tirade). in the book, obviously the war was not iraq, but rather, vietnam, and when the house turns on that video of the son in the helicopter, i was truly creeped out. overall, i was impressed with the movie, in that it followed the book very well.",1

"this is an action western. james steart leads an all star cast in the scenic northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. the scenery and costumes are great. there is action and adventure. stewart plays a wealthy cattleman who runs afoul of a crooked government in the old nothwest.  the main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that hollywood has always made into a hero. even when this movie was made, the cynic was the stereotypical hero, and the one stewart portrays really has few saving graces. he is kind to his two partners, and that does give him an extra dimension of credibility and likability.  however, he is so piggish to everyone else, it is hard to really care for him, or to accept him. he is much like the one dimensional spaghetti western characters (cut not that bad).  still, the minor characters are quite enjoyable. walter brennan, royal dano, harry morgan, and others make this worth watching.",0
"oh, man, how low serials had fallen as by 1952! this dull thing is precisely the kind of serial that annoyed annie wilkes (from misery). not only the heroes escape the traps by adding scenes that weren't there in the previous chapter (and that couldn't possibly be there - tell me that when the baddies blow up the plain in episode 7 to 8 they wouldn't see the characters jump), but i think this serial has the world's record of stock footage. i mean, most of it is stock footage! and not just from another serials (apparently all the flying sequences come from king of the rocket men, and the cool ""molten rocks"" scenes of episode 2 to 3 is from adventures of captain marvel), but from itself! the whole ""trip to the moon"" sequence (which is probably the shortest ever, it's 30 seconds long and the characters never seem to leave earth's atmosphere) from episode 1 is repeated in episode 8! and episode 10 is all scenes from previous episodes! (ever wondered why mst3k never did episodes 10, 11 and 12? well, they had to stop after 9 so they didn't have to do the whole thing again!).  don't get me started on the science factor. prepare to see the sunniest moon ever! and moon men that can not breathe on their own world? what were they smoking?   and if this is not enough, it's too talky and the stunts (usually the best thing in serials) are few and far. visually-wise, am i the only one who thinks that commando cody's bullet-shaped (or is it lemon-shaped) helmet is totally ridiculous-looking? the rocketeer's was way cooler, no matter how bad that movie was (and man, was it awful). the tank-like vehicle isn't much better, it looks like a bunch of kids made it for halloween. the only positive thing i can think of about it is that the actor who plays the hero is homely instead of the usual muscular hunk (hey, everybody has the right to be an hero!), but then he's so unappealing...  not even worth watching for nostalgia's sake. see captain marvel instead. 2/10.

"this is a fantastic series first and foremost. it is very well done and very interesting. as a huge wwii buff, i had learned a lot before seeing this series. one of the best things this has going for it is all the interviews with past individuals back when the war was relatively fresh in their minds, comparatively speaking that is. it is nothing against the men that you see getting interviewed in the programs of today, it is just that most of these men weren't really involved in the upper echelons of what was happening then. one of the best parts is the narrating by sir laurence oliver. i would recommend this to anyone that wants to learn about wwii, but really think only the die-hards (such as myself) will want to buy this or watch it more than once. my only real complaint about this entire series is that some of the facts aren't quite as accurate as we now know. especially with the information about soviet union is exaggerated or just plain inaccurate in places. that information is now different we now know because of the fall of the ussr. overall a fascinating look at wwii and a must see for any serious wwii historian professional or personal alike.",1

"a student filmmaker enlists a b-grade actress (a delectably diva-ish molly ringwald!) to complete the horror film that her mother (a dreadfully dull kylie minogue!) tried to make 12 years ago. it's a curious plot choice to say the least, as any aussie horror fan knows that the genre is sadly lacking in women directors. the film has a curse on it, because molly had to kill some psycho murderer on the original set. but she's back, because she needs the exposure. unfortunately, the curse is still there and people start dying on the ""set."" cut is an aussie attempt at the modern ""slasher,"" but unfortunately it doesn't bring anything new or exciting to the table. in fact, it rips half of wes craven's 90s filmography. lots of film-world name-dropping a la ""scream"" (except it's aussie name-dropping--jane campion...see how this isn't as funny) and lots of ""is this real or is this a movie"" a la ""new nightmare."" the editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are laughable, almost everything is bad about this. fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the movie crew says to the owner of the house they are filming at: ""don't worry, we'll treat your house as if it were our own,"" to which he responds, ""that doesn't mean anything to me, you look like you live in a dump!"" ha! and molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough to not regret renting this one. ""you got any diet coke in here?"" (as she rides in the film professor's car) and ""does anyone know where i can buy any tofu?""

"the finale of the weissmuller tarzan movies is a rather weak one. there are a few things that derail this film.  first, tarzan spends much of the film wearing floppy sandals. in my opinion, any footwear on tarzan, whether it be sandals or boots as sometimes portrayed, takes away from the character, which is supposed to be anti-civilization and pro-jungle.  second, the character of benji, as mentioned in a previous post, totally derails the movie as the comic foil. to me, his character is unnecessary to the film's plot.  also, while weissmuller still cuts a commanding figure as tarzan, it's apparent that he was not in his best shape. although in his later jungle jim movies, his physique had improved somewhat from this film.  the octopus battle is a terrific idea, but i think it should have been done in an earlier weissmuller film when he was at his physical peak. likewise, the battle, which takes only 30 seconds tops, would be much more thrilling if it was drawn out to 90 seconds to 2 minutes like the classic giant crocodile battle in tarzan and his mate.  and while brenda joyce as jane and linda christian as mara are overwhelmingly pleasing to the eye, it doesn't manage to salvage this last weissmuller film - a disappointing ending to a great character run.",0

"i gave this 4 stars because it has a lot of interesting themes many here have already mentioned. from the domestic violence, to sexuality and many of the taboos therein. outside of the gore i really would not call this horror so much as i would science fiction.  it's bleak, depressing and hopeless. while i don't mind a less than cheery ending, i'm really very tired of the ""humans suck"" cliché that's central to every movie. i know you can't get a liberal arts degree today without bowing to the alter of self-hatred as a member of the human race, but how's 'bout as a writer/director we pretend we are different than everyone else in the pack and notice that the aliens killing the human race are evil! right now, if you are reading this and believe that humanity deserves to die, just go out, find a lake and swim 'til your arms are tired. this way you won't be around to direct the next film or write the next book telling me i deserve to die for being alive. it's silly, not thoughtful, and boring.",0
"i love killer insects movies they are great fun to watch, i had to watch this movie as it was one of my favourite horror books by shaun hutson.  i have met him and i wish i did listen to him as this movie was terrible like he said it was,after he said that i was still dying to see how bad it was.  the plot: people are dying mysteriously and gruesomely, and nobody has a clue what the cause is.  only health worker mike brady has a possible solution, but his theory of killer slugs is laughed at by the authorities.  only when the body count begins to rise and a slug expert from england begins snooping around does it begin to look like mike had the right idea after all.  this movie as the most overacting you ever see a movie! slugs in this movie are fast (then normal) and it looks like they fast forwarding the scenes!   this movie is nothing like the book at all, the book was ten times scarier, ten times gory and had a lot more story to it!  i didn't like this movie at all! as i am huge fan of slugs the book and second book called breeding ground! both of books are great   read the book then watch the movie, you may like more then i did give this 2 out 10",0
"nowhere near the original. it's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. but the directing is very poor. basinger is weak - without good directing. baldwin is simply just a second league compared to mcqueen. i watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of peckinpah's masterpiece, and i got what i thought. almost a b movie with second rate acting and directing. i wasn't even disappointed, i just don't know what they were trying to do. this remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.  it reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.  this is a complete waste of your time. save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:)))",0
"watching beautiful women sneaking around, playing cops and robbers is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium film lets me enjoy. so the house on carroll street was not entirely a waste of time, although the story is contrived and the screenplay uninspired and somewhat irritating.  there are many allusions to different hitchcock pictures, not least the choice of kelly mcgillis in the starring role. she is dressed up as grace kelly, and she is not far off the mark. not at all. but her character is not convincing. the way she is introduced to the audience, she should be someone with political convictions and a purpose in life. after all the movie deals with a clearly defined time period, true events and a specific issue. but the story degenerates within the first minutes into a sorry run-off-the-mill crime story with unbelievable coincidences, high predictability and a set of two dimensional characters. this is all the more regrettable, as the performances of the actors are good, as are the photography and the set design.  the finale in central station, new york is breath taking. it starts in the subterranean section and then moves up to the roof. the movie can be praised for its good use of architecture.",0
"of the films of the young republic few in number as they are the buccaneer (1958)stands out as a finely crafted film. charleton heston excels in his portrayal of old hickory's defence of new orleans with a thrown together force of militia, regulars and pirates promised a reprieve.  after christmas 1814 peninsula veterans led by sir edward packenham, the duke of wellington's brother in law bore down on the city of new orleans. andy jackson had a day to draw together a scratch force to defend the city behind bales of hay.  charlton heston projects jackson's terrifying presence and awe inspiring power of command. yet there are a few colorful comic relief. with the might of the english lioness about to pounce, a young blond haired voluteer from new orleans asks: i guess the ruckus is about to start.  the battle was about to rage but not for long. true to form the british marched straight into withering american fire. in less than a few minutes an attempt to reconquer lost north american territories had been foiled.  the battle scene in this movies lasts slightly longer than the actual battle itself.  there are colorful side stories in this film of the young volunteer at his first dance to celebrate the victory.",1
"slither is a horror comedy that doesn't really have enough horror or comedy to qualify as one or the other. it has one scene that is exceptionally good, any number of zingers that work, but very few real scares and not enough humor to maintain the movie. in addition, the script does not focus on the hero and heroine, and goes off kilter in several places.  a major failing of this film is that it introduces and then leaves its hero (fillion) to follow grant grant (michael rooker) as he is first introduced and then becomes the monster. this whole part of the film drags - michael rooker's character isn't that interesting to us as a person, and watching as he goes through a series of motions while acting in the monster's interest might be interesting if this was grant - portrait of a man turning into a monster rather than a horror-comedy alien invasion movie. in the final analysis this movie's problems are in the script - it isn't that important to the audience how the monster acts or propagates. the purpose of a horror-comedy is to get the heroes backed up in a corner with shotguns and then throw bugs at them, with them cracking wise every time something frightening or disgusting happens. instead we get an exploration of the alien's habits and tactics that just makes this part of the movie drag. the ostensible heroine (elizabeth banks as starla grant) is more central to this part, but nonetheless i felt the movie had left its narrative track, unless it planned on following grant grant all the way to the end.  when fillion and his posse finally confront the alien the movie does begin to cook, but once again the problem is in the script. by this point that audience knows - and the characters should know - that grant is not just suffering from some disease, and act accordingly (shotguns) - instead they continuously parley in the face of increasing evidence that this is not something that ""let us get you to a hospital"" is going to help. although their reactions might have been human and real, these are characters in an action movie and simply should have done what the movie promised - delivered action. a lack of action scenes in a movie with as few ideas as this is a great failing.  *** spoilers ahead *** after the first confrontation and the bursting of the alien larval sack (a minor character and perhaps the best scene in the movie) the script once again betrays the movie. at this point one of the characters is almost taken over by the alien and develops an insight into the alien. the writer-director (gunn) chooses as this character a completely new character, rather than one of already developed minor characters. why? why did he need to introduce a completely new character more than an hour into the movie that becomes central to the plot? by the time this character is attacked, we know hardly anything about her and could care less about her, even though she is a winsome teenage girl in her bath. had gunn decided not to use this character and just used one of the established minor characters, he could have completely avoided introducing her family, and saved time and money. furthermore, the hero and heroine would have been filled in on the alien's plans without all the additional characters, and could have gotten around to blowing away aliens sooner and with more vigor.  my last criticism is based on the movie's look. gunn is primarily a writer, or maybe it was budgetary constraints, but this movie looked ugly and uninteresting. most of the action takes place at night in woods or on a field, and the screen simply looks drab. the sets in wheelsy (the fictional town where the action takes place) look cheap. the whole movie looks cheap. box office mojo states the films' budget was $15 million, newspapers say $29 million, and considering they didn't use any name talent, i would say the money did not show up on screen. the monster is just repulsive, and rarely looks deadly.  the last criticism is primarily based on the reality of the character's actions. by the time fillion and co have begun hunting grant/the alien, one woman has disappeared and grant is known to have been mutilating animals. at this point i was expecting the fbi or at least the state police to show up and take over from the hick sheriff. a woman has disappeared and likely been murdered, and a local has been acting psychotic. time to call the authorities. but basically i was hoping that would happen because i just wanted some characters who would show up and act.  although this movie is ostensibly a horror-comedy, the movie it bears the most resemblance to is dreamcatcher in terms of monstrous invasion and the type of monster and its intentions. whereas dreamcatcher had much bigger problems with story (especially the entire morgan freeman subplot) and particularly the ending, in many ways it was stronger, primarily because the main characters were stronger, but more importantly because it looked beautiful. although that may be anathema - preferring the movie that is weaker in general plot and structural spine because of production values - that just shows you how uninteresting i found the look of slither.",0
"'the hills eyes ii', one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time, is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest. or worst, however you choose to look at it. while 2006's 'hills' remake was one of the year's best, and truly frightening, horror films, this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment. part 2 never gets off the ground, and neither does its mind numbing dialogue. worst of all, it's not that scary.  2006's remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the new mexico desert, deserted, and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people. people who, as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago, have become who they are. surviving off travelers who wander into the region. the sequel puts audiences in the same desert, now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family. when a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite, they find it deserted with no signs of life. a grim reality soon befalls them, as they come to the realization that they're not alone. and the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destiny.  it doesn't take a genius to realize that 'hills' has no legitimate reason to exist. but because last year's remake was received well both at the box office and by critics, it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while there's still money to be earned. there's no rhyme or reason to it this time around, just an unbelievable and ridiculous set-up to pave the way for thoughtless characters, unoriginal killings, a non-existent story, and slipping interest. originally, director alexander aja made craven's cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience. one that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions. its frank display of violence, sadistic torture, well-rounded characterization, and white-knuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences. the second time around, it's rehashed hand-me-downs. there's no style, no grit. it tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies, when all it really does is make for a been there, done that kind film, where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbaths.  it's a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention. it's a bore, nothing more. 'hills' has no bite. despite a jump or two here and there, there's nothing very scary about this by-the-numbers horror flick. it feels like something you'd see on the sci-fi channel, only with some f-bombs, a blood splatter here and there, a rape, and a graphic birth scene that's more gross than shocking. it's cheap. and with 'hills', you reap what you sew. with no effort given, you can't expect anything in return.  replacing aja with martin weisz as director was the film's first big mistake, all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance. but even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by wes craven and his son, jonathan craven. you ask, how bad could it possibly be? this is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like shakespeare. craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past, but i'd never expect something like this from him. it's so unintentionally funny, you have to wonder, is craven playing a joke on this? or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off? the film's characters are one-dimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense. the acting is just as bad. the only character who may win you over is 'napoleon' napoli, the scrawny kid who doesn't fit in with the others. even the deranged and instinct-driven villains, who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago, are met with indifferent. you don't hate them, you don't like them. you honestly couldn't care less. just like this movie.  even if you were giddy with fear during 'the hills have eyes', as i was, you'll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage. it's as generic as generic gets, and there's absolutely nothing here we haven't seen done many times already. i can't express this enough, avoid 'the hills have eyes ii' like the plague. it's frightless, unoriginal, frantic, and a bore. stick to the remake or craven's original vision. because if you don't walk out after the first thirty minutes, don't say i didn't warn you.",0
"some movies are repellent but still fascinating (pulp fiction); others are simply boring. this movie has an almost unique feature of being both utterly repellent and totally boring. by the end i didn't care about any of the characters, i just wanted all of them dead so i could get out of the theatre.",0
"even though i'm quite young, the beatles are my absolutely favourite band! i never had the chance to hear their music as it was releases but have loved them since i can remember.  it's the sort of film that is worth trying the once. i can see why it wasn't released in the cinema but it is certainly a great film to put on the tv. i was flicking through my tv guide and happened to see this film, it didn't much details except something like, 'john lennon and paul mccartney meet after the beatles have broken up, jared harris stars'. i'd never heard of him (he played john) or aiden quinn who played paul. however they are certainly underestimated actors!  the film had a slow start but as it developed, i could see how well quinn but especially harris played their characters. as a huge fan, i sort of know what the real lennon and mccartney are like. the script was brilliant and harris got lennon's accent, personality and mannerisms spot on! quinn played mccartney quite well but sometimes went into his irish accent. the make-up artists made them look excellent.  this paragraph may be counted as a *spoiler*:  as i mentioned before, it got off to a slow start but soon developed and became quite an emotional film. i found the bit in the park a total waste of time and quite out of character for both of the musicians. as for lennon's rude line in the italian restaurant, totally unnecessary. the ending was very poignant and brings a tear to my eye whenever i watch it.  it is quite different from the other biographical films i've seen where it's about how the beatles got together and became famous, and those never really did the characters that well. e.g. 'backbeat'.  in conclusion, i would say, if you're a beatles or john lennon or paul mccartney fan, give it a chance you may have pleasent surprise. at only about 95 minutes long, it's worth waiting for the film to develop.  if anyone does know whether the meeting of 1976 really did happen please send it to the 'comments page' for this film, i'd be very interested.",1
"this obvious pilot for an unproduced tv series features young canadian actress shiri appleby as an amnesiac with some pretty incredible powers that must be put to use when a man-turned-flying demon is let loose on the world. the cgi is par for a tv job, and appleby is ok as an amnesiac but hard to swallow as a superheroine. familiar tv face richard burgi is along for the ride as appleby's mentor, but he can do nothing to elevate this dreck above the mediocre level. we see way too much of the cartoonish flying demon right from the start, a bad sign. also, the scenes where burgi is training appleby for battle are actually laughable. they are a bad copy of similar scenes in several other movies, most notably remo williams.",0
"with the death of george nader, on 4 february 2002, i thought of this most interesting program, which even though it had only a short run, was a tremendous idea with good story lines throughout. generally unseen for over 40+ years it would be worth viewing again. the opening credits showed many differing images, one of which was a snippit of colonel john paul stapp, riding his famed rocket sled, at the point where he was often referred to as ""the fastest man alive"".",1
"final score...who cares - it's a reality show. it has no love for it's audience, it panders to lazy tv viewers, puts nothing in and gets nothing out.  ""joe millionaire"", the most blatantly phony reality show of them all, is a television disaster of epic proportions. it's a watershed, rock bottom moment, not only for fox, but for the american viewing public who actually watch, like and talked about this crap the next day. you people ought to be ashamed of yourselves. because as much as fox promotes this junk it won't make any money unless it's watch by people (and boy was it, the finale got nearly super bowl numbers!?). it doesn't bother you people that there are many quality shows written, directed, acted and generally have effort put into them that are being cancelled while you sit back and lap up this effortless, cold game show?  i used to be a staunch supporter of fox. it's those of us like me who like and seek out quality tv that helped build fox back in the days of married...with children and the simpsons. conveniently enough, now neither of those shows would make it 6 weeks with the current management. the gail berman ""reign of terror"" as it's often called. the network has waged war on scripted tv and, strangely enough, it's fans. the very people who helped build them in the beginning. now, not only do we have to fight for good shows, but we have to fight against their own network. it boggles the mind. nothing fox, has done in the past 3 years makes any sense. from canceling hits like ""titus"", ""futurama"" and ""john doe"" (nbc can renew ""boomtown"", but fox can't lift it's pitiful head to give the only decent show they had this season another shot?). and the reason they can do all this: the success of junk like ""joe millionaire"". they can now say ""we don't need you tv fans, we have reality shows"". they apparently seem to have no idea that the big audience the draw with this junk is fickle and will abandon them the second the next fad comes along. to alienate their base like this will eventually kill the network the way it has set back abc.  the show itself is a joke. here we have a premise, in the now classic fox gimmick, that promises us something different and edgy, but then delivers something not in any way different from ""the bachelor"" or anything on the big 3. fox has gone mainstream. the finale and ""twist"" (quote/unquote) showed they have no ideas up their sleeve. now we know that all these shows, no matter how different they look, will all end up the same cornball, fairy tale ending. we got to see a bunch of lame aspiring actors that the network picked out of millions of head-shots to fit their demographics parade around like high school bimbos pretending they liked this evan marriott because...well because it was a competition and that's what you're supposed to do. marriott himself is like a hideously disfigured chro-magnum man who struggles to put together the simplest sentences. but, how can the women (all average to ugly looking by the way - an important minus is a guilty pleasure show like this) not fall for ""joe"" with such charming lines like ""look, you're not stupid"".  i used to think that people who watched these reality/dating/game shows were just to lazy to change the channel, but after ""joe millionaire"" i think they must be genuinely mentally deficient. come on people, have a little more pride in yourselves. demand a little bit more from your entertainment then this.  boycott fox.",0
